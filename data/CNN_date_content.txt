2015-02-13	(CNN) It swept across 214 countries worldwide and killed more than 18,000 people. The 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, dubbed "swine flu," put the entire world on alert. The outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic until August 2010.  But threat of deadly disease outbreaks didn't stop -- or start -- there.  In 2003, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crossed the world, originating in Asia and reaching Canada in less than a day.  Then, in 2012, a new virus emerged in the Middle East and has now entered the global arena. Aptly named Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) it continued to spread globally with outbreaks now taking place in South Korea. As of June 3, 1179 people have been infected with MERS-CoV across 25 countries --including 442 deaths -- according to the World Health Organization.  The current outbreak in South Korea has led to 35 confirmed cases -- including 3 deaths -- and as of June 2, 1369 people were under quarantine. The virus began its spread slowly initially but is now gaining momentum.  In 2014, the disease on everyone's mind was Ebola. The Ebola virus has infected more than 27,000 people across ten countries to date, with more than 11,100 deaths as of 13 June 2015. However, despite the high number of infections, the spread of Ebola remains technically an outbreak, not a pandemic, because it hasn't spread globally.  "It will only be over when the last person with Ebola is either dead or recovered without infecting other people," stated Peter Piot, who co-discovered the virus in the 1970s, at the 2015 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. But he warned that risks from such outbreaks were far from over, saying: "There will be other Ebola outbreaks and there will be other epidemics, not least influenza."  But is the world ready?  Hundreds of infectious diseases continue to plague the planet in both urban and rural locations, from ones spread by insects, such as C hikungunya, which is currently sweeping through the Americas , to those spread by water, such as cholera, or human contact, such as Ebola. "Infectious organisms can travel in humans, food and insects ... you can't stop disease from crossing borders," says David Heymann, head of the Centre for Global Health Security at think tank Chatham House  Early warning  One initiative in place to identify those posing a more global risk is the WHO-led Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN) . "[It's] a series of laboratories, national public health institutions and groups like Medecins Sans Frontiers who report regularly when an outbreak occurs," says Heymann. The goal is the rapid identification, confirmation and response to outbreaks of international importance.  "The ones with most risk are airborne," says Heymann. The greatest pandemic to date was the Spanish flu which spread in 1918 and is estimated to have infected a third of the world's population at the time and caused approximately 50 million deaths. More recently, the hardest hitting outbreaks were the SARS coronavirus in 2003, followed by H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. All of which were respiratory infections with the potential to spread far and fast.  "With flu I'm quite sure there will be another pandemic," says Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College, London. Barclay researches the origin of pandemics and why some viruses cross species to jump from animals into humans. In the case of H1N1, the virus was a re-assortment of bird flu and pig influenza viruses, resulting in a new form infectious to humans and with no immunity among those at risk.  "If it's a new one, there's no pre-existing antibodies to hold that off ... and you may then pass it on to someone else," says Barclay.  Experts agree that future outbreaks and potential pandemics may occur, but the lessons learned from previous ones should enable a faster response. The key is to identify the virus, estimate its threat and its potential to spread across a population as quickly as possible to then put a pandemic preparedness plan into action.  "Flu is difficult to control in terms of an outbreak," says Barclay, as the virus has the ability to spread before people show symptoms, meaning measures such as airport screening are ineffective. The converse is true for viruses such as Ebola and particularly SARS, where people are only contagious once showing symptoms of the disease. "We were able to contain SARS," says Barclay, because patients could only transmit the virus days after symptoms had begun. If a patient was admitted to hospital soon after their symptoms appeared, there was a lesser risk that they had already infected others in their wake.  Planning and preparation  The challenge facing public health teams across the world is the fact they must be ready to expect the unexpected. SARS, swine flu and Ebola took everyone by surprise. "It's completely unpredictable in the end," says Barclay. Confronting this unknown are mathematical modelers, including the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) -- a network of scientists who visualize how a disease might spread.  "It's useful to predict where an outbreak is going," says Irene Eckstrand, the former scientific director of MIDAS. Under Eckstrand's leadership, the modelers in her program predicted scenarios for various big outbreaks, including H1N1 and currently Ebola.  Information about the biology of the virus, the mode of transmission, and the geographical spread can be used to predict who will be affected next and how fast they'll be reached. The various scenarios modeled are then used to inform policy decisions such as travel restrictions and school closures by determining their impact. It's also crucial to envision the distribution of vaccines, to ensure the most vulnerable are reached first. In the case of Ebola, models helped determine the number of hospital beds required in high-risk areas.  The likelihood of disease models accurately reflecting reality are regularly called into question but Eckstrand states they are crucial when working with the unknown.  "Infectious disease models are never going to accurately predict the future," she says. "[They] are better at saying 'if we do this, here's the range of things that can happen.'" When a virus is well understood, such models can be generated quickly. "Models can integrate complexities in a way our brains can't," says Eckstrand.  JUST WATCHED Cultural practices aiding Ebola spread Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cultural practices aiding Ebola spread 02:08  However, the spread of a disease is about more than its biology. Human behavior plays a key role and is much harder to predict, as was the case for Ebola, where burial traditions and cultural practices aided transmission when the outbreak emerged. The lack of trust between those affected in West Africa and their health authorities also prevented people from seeking diagnosis and treatment.  "[There's been a] great deal more collaboration in Ebola," says Eckstrand speaking of weekly phone calls between those working on control, including scientists, researchers, homeland security and national laboratories.  Are we ready?  "The world is unprepared," stated WHO director general Margaret Chan at a session alongside Peter Piot in Davos. "After H1N1, the conclusion was the world is ill prepared for severe and sustained disease." In her eyes, the scale of Ebola last year was unprecedented. New ideas are needed to prevent this happening again in the future.  "We need to think outside the box in the future," says Barclay, whose team works on the development of vaccines to stop the H1N1 pandemic in its tracks. But she doesn't think disease-specific vaccines are the way forward for all outbreaks. "For Ebola, Chikungunya, Lassa fever, Marburg ... are we really going to invent one for each one?" Barclay instead thinks one way forward could be therapeutics that tackle the symptoms of disease, meaning where diseases have similar symptoms -- such as Ebola and Marburg virus disease -- there could be a drug against the symptoms of all of them to reduce further spread of infections.  But when it comes to influenza, where the greatest global risk lies, the experts seem more optimistic.  "If we had another flu pandemic we would be fairly well set to run models quickly," says Eckstrand. Given the likelihood of another pandemic, Barclay's team see it fit in this case to develop disease-specific antivirals and vaccines against influenza when it arrives. In 2009, the development of an H1N1 vaccine slowed down the spread of the virus during the second wave of its transmission. The time taken for development meant it wasn't available during the first big wave of infections.  At the core of it all, the global monitoring systems in place are constantly being tuned to spot any strange, or new, occurrences.  "I look at GOARN as a safety net," concludes Heymann. GOARN is growing its capability to both spot and control disease outbreaks, with a network of labs, provision of advice and assistance when a new outbreak occurs. It is also building capacity within countries through improved labs, technology and skilled staff, to enable systems to be in place worldwide to tackle new or emerging infections spreading throughout a population.  "Countries that have had Ebola are more ready to deal with it, like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)," says Heymann of the country where the disease was first identified in 1976. Congolese communities now have a word for the disease and messages are in place to send out when a new outbreak occurs.  With MERS now climbing to the top as the infection on people's minds, its worth knowing that whilst we may not be quite ready to prevent disease outbreaks, we are, at least, more ready than ever before.
2015-06-09	Hong Kong (CNN) The numbers sound scary as cases and deaths of MERS mount daily in South Korea.  People are commuting with face masks in a densely crowded Asian capital, schools are shutting doors and mandatory quarantines are in effect. But what really are the risks and dangers to the general public?  As one official said, South Korea is fighting two battles: MERS and public fear.  Should I be worried about getting MERS?  Not really.  "It's not a very contagious disease," said Dr. Stanley Perlman, one of the authors of a comprehensive MERS review published in the journal Lancet this month. "Personally, people shouldn't be worried, but I can understand the fear factor."  South Koreans are being told to take basic preventative measures like keeping hands clean, covering coughs and avoiding personal contact.  Steps to prevent MERS Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.  Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then dispose of the tissue.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid personal contact, such as kissing, or sharing cups or eating utensils, with sick people.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. Source: CDC  A person with MERS is estimated to infect less than one other person. It's called a basic reproduction number that estimates the average number of people that a sick person will infect.  Compared with the reproduction number for Ebola, (in which one infected person is likely to spread the disease to two other people) or measles (one infected person is likely to to spread the infection to 15 other people), the rate of MERS is low indeed.  How infectious is MERS?  Here's what the science shows: A 2014 research looked at how many people got ill after living in the same home as MERS patients in Saudi Arabia, the country most affected by MERS, Of 280 people who lived in the same households of the Saudi patients, 4% were infected, according to the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  If you haven't been sick at a South Korean hospital, and you haven't traveled to Saudi Arabia, you really need not panic. Experts say your risk is low.  But could the virus change?  The MERS virus could mutate -- in the same way viruses are known to undergo changes and genetic recombinations. But right now, there is no evidence of genetic mutation in what's been found in the South Korean cases compared to the Saudi cases.  But coronaviruses are prone to mutation, which could increase risk of a pandemic.  So, why are more cases popping up in South Korea?

Hide Caption 10 of 10  That's one of the most important questions right now.  The World Health Organization has a fact finding mission this week to examine what's happening with MERS in South Korea.  South Korea has a modern and sophisticated health care system. And that could be one of the reasons why the country is reporting so many cases. They're testing people who could've been exposed or are showing any possible symptoms of MERS.  MERS symptoms are fairly general including cold-like symptoms, cough, fever and nausea.  CNN asked the Ministry of Health how many people in the country have been tested for MERS, but have not gotten a number.  Shouldn't growing number of MERS concern us?  The MERS count includes people with mild symptoms, and at least one of the confirmed cases has been completely asymptomatic.  The growing case count doesn't mean everyone with MERS is gravely ill. Several patients have been cleared and hundreds have been released from quarantine.  How did the MERS outbreak start in South Korea?  The first MERS patient in South Korea traveled to four Middle Eastern countries. After he developed symptoms, he visited four health care facilities back home. This means he exposed his fellow patients, their families and health care staff in several facilities before getting diagnosed.  "I think it's the combination of poor initial handling of the first patient," said Perlman. "When a MERS patient came to the U.S. or Europe, they were isolated when there was hint of something going on. In this case, the patient wandered around hospitals and family members weren't protected and that's the reason why it's gotten worse than other non Arabian countries."  Why does it matter that the MERS cases occurred in hospitals?  The bulk of the latest MERS cases have come from two hospitals: St. Mary's, located south of Seoul, and the Samsung Medical Center, based in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district.  Similar to emergency rooms in the United States, hospitals in Korea are often crowded with sick patients waiting to get care. They are exposed to each other in close proximity.  JUST WATCHED Parents grapple with MERS worries Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents grapple with MERS worries 02:06  Also in South Korea, family members rather than nurses often stay bedside by patients, changing them and taking care of them. This also exposes them to additional risk of infection.  Hospital-based MERS outbreaks are by no means new though.  Saudi Arabia reported a 2013 outbreak that infected 23 patients in an intensive care unit. In that outbreak, 15 people died.  How deadly is MERS?  Like many viral diseases, MERS is much more lethal for people who are already severely ill. Of those who've died in South Korea after contracting MERS, the deceased patients had pre-existing conditions including cancer, COPD and chronic heart disease.  "There's a lot of illnesses that make people more prone to infection," Perlman said. "The obvious are asthma, emphysema, lung disease might not be able to handle infection very well."  MERS globally has been known to carry about a 30 to 40% death rate. But the death rate in the South Korean outbreak has consistently remained been under 10%.  Perlman says he believes the death rate could be lower because South Korean health authorities are finding more cases including mild ones that may not have been picked up before.  Should kids stay home from school?  Not really. Of nearly 100 cases in South Korea, only one of the MERS cases is a teenager. This doesn't mean that children don't get infected -- but it's worth looking at the facts that the vast majority of the MERS patients are older.  Perlman says he doesn't think shutting schools is ideal since the virus is not very contagious, but said he "can understand why people worry."  Does MERS pose a threat to the United States?  Well, MERS has already popped up in the United States in 2014 -- long before the South Korean cases.  Both cases in the United States involved health workers who worked in Saudi Arabia and traveled to Indiana and Florida.  The World Health Organization doesn't recommend any travel or trade restrictions.  Hong Kong, which grappled with SARS over 10 years ago, issued a red alert warning travelers to avoid non-essential travel to South Korea.  Speaking of SARS, are the two related?  MERS is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome -- coronavirus) as well as the common cold. However, unlike SARS , which sickened more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 773 worldwide, MERS does not spread easily between humans.  SARS eventually waned because health officials quarantined people who were exposed and contained the infection.  Are there worrying aspects of MERS?  Yes, it comes down to the fact that scientists don't know much about MERS. It's a relatively new syndrome and there is no vaccine or cure. And the exact mode of how MERS is transmitted remains unknown.

2015-07-09	MERS is a viral respiratory illness brought on by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) as well as the common cold.  The illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.  Researchers don't yet know its exact mode of transmission, but it has spread through close contact with people who are ill. It is thought to spread through respiratory secretions, like coughing. MERS does not spread easily between humans.  Since September 2012, there have been at least 2,428 laboratory confirmed cases and at least 838 deaths worldwide. Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries (as of April 2019).  Diagnosis/Treatment:  Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, kidney failure and gastrointestinal issues. Not all those infected are symptomatic.  There is no vaccine and no recommended antiviral treatment.  The mortality rate for reported cases is about one third.

2018-08-23	(CNN) A case of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, has been detected in a patient in England, the first case since 2013, according to Public Health England.  The individual is the fifth person ever to be diagnosed with the disease in the country.  The patient, who traveled into the UK aboard a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight, was first admitted to a hospital in Leeds before being transferred to the Royal Liverpool Hospital in Liverpool, which specializes in respiratory infectious diseases. The patient is currently stable and receiving the necessary treatment.  "The patient is thought to have contracted the infection whilst in the Middle East before traveling to the UK," said Dr. Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE.  "Public Health England is following up those who have had close and sustained contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary."  What is MERS?  MERS is a viral respiratory illness brought on by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It is in the same family of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ), as well as the common cold.  Symptoms include shortness of breath, fever, cough, kidney failure and gastrointestinal issues, however not all of those infected with the illnesses are symptomatic.  Researchers don't yet know its exact mode of transmission, but the illness -- first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 -- generally spreads through close contact with people who are ill . It is thought to spread through respiratory secretions, such as coughing.  Because little is known about the epidemiology of the disease, for example how people are infected and how it spreads, treating the illness can be complicated, according to Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine International Public Health.  "MERS-CoV is a disease we worry about because we don't have any specific countermeasures to it. We've got no specific drugs, no specific vaccine, or anything to deal with it," said Whitworth.  "Essentially we need to identify cases, get them into isolation and to give them intensive supportive care until they get better."  The virus was possibly first transmitted from an animal to a human, as a 2014 study showed that three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past MERS exposure. It's believed that the disease originated in bats and was then passed on to camels, according to WHO.  Since September 2012 -- when the first case was detected in humans -- there have been 2,229 other laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, according to WHO, which resulted in the deaths of 791 people, around 35% of reported patients.  The illness has been detected in 27 countries, including the UK, the United States, Turkey, Thailand and China among others. Around 80% of cases have been detected in Saudi Arabia.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  Nonetheless, human-to-human transmission of the virus is difficult.  "It is important to emphasize that although a case has been identified, the overall risk of disease transmission to the public is very low," said Harries.  PHE is currently contacting people who might have had close contact with the infected individual in order to monitor symptoms. This includes a number of passengers who traveled on the same flight as the patient.  "As we've seen in previous cases, we have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimize the risk of transmission," said Harries.

MERS still isn't entirely understood, but there are now clear guidelines around how to handle the disease, said Whitworth.
2020-01-06	(CNN) Chinese health authorities have not been able to identify a mysterious strain of pneumonia that has infected dozens of people and put the rest of Asia on alert -- although they have ruled out a return of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus.  A total of 59 cases of unknown viral pneumonia have been reported in the city of Wuhan, central China, with seven patients in critical condition, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. All patients are being treated in quarantine, and no deaths have been reported.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms of the pneumonia are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs.  The outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia.  SARS spread to 37 countries worldwide , infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 from November 2002 to July 2003. The illness is brought on by a coronavirus, and symptoms include fever, cough, severe headache, dizziness and other flu-like complaints.  Amid growing disquiet, Wuhan authorities said on Sunday they had excluded the possibility of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and bird flu.  Women wear facemasks as the city's commuters protect themselves against the H7N9 bird flu virus in the downtown area of Shanghai in 2013.  If not SARS, then what is it?  According to the Wuhan health commission, the infection broke out between December 12 and December 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city.  Local media reported that the market -- which has been closed since January 1 for disinfection -- also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes, sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.  Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it is highly likely that the outbreak was caused by a "brand-new viral pneumonia."  "The concern now is whether the game (sold at the market) is one of the reasons for the outbreak," he told CNN.  According to Hui, many new pathogens have been transmitted to humans from animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic first broke out. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS, he said.  Authorities have said that there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and no health care workers have been infected. At least 163 people who have had close contact with those infected have been placed under medical observation.  But there are still fears of a nationwide epidemic. The outbreak came just before the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel season, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25.  Professor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and a SARS expert, said the severity of the situation to come depends on whether the pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted among humans.  "If it only transmits from animals to humans, now that the market has been shut down and sanitized, the chances for people to be infected will be low," he said.  Hui, from Chinese University, said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out.  "Most often, respiratory viruses can be transmitted among humans. It is only a matter of how contagious it is," he said.  Passengers get their temperature checked in 2015 as part of preventive measures against the spread of MERS at Hong Kong airport.  Asia steps up screening  The current outbreak in Wuhan has put Asian governments on close watch, stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the city would take "immediate action" to contain the spread of suspected pneumonia cases, including screening air passengers traveling from Wuhan. Doctors in the semiautonomous Chinese city must also report patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases to the authorities.  A total of 21 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after traveling from Wuhan, according to Hong Kong's Hospital Authority. Seven of them have been discharged, and so far none of them has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan.  In Singapore, travelers arriving from the Chinese city are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there.  In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a quarantine task force and warned visitors to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry, or visit local markets.  Taiwan on Sunday stepped up measures by expanding the conditions for notification of suspected cases of Wuhan pneumonia, according to government-run news agency CNA.  A doctor injects a flu vaccination.  The World Health Organization said in a statement Sunday that "there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology."  It said it does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and "advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event."  Fall and winter months are traditionally prone to flu epidemics. In the United States, the current flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.  He said while it is impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-18 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
2020-01-08	(CNN) A mysterious pneumonia outbreak that has struck dozens of people and put China on edge is from the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to Chinese scientists.  They've found a new coronavirus in 15 of 57 patients with the illness in the central city of Wuhan, Hubei province saying it has been preliminarily identified as the pathogen for the outbreak, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.  The report said the whole genome sequence of the virus has been obtained, and a sample isolated from one of the patients showed "typical coronavirus appearance" under an electron microscope.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death. Some coronaviruses transmit easily from person to person, while others do not.  The SARS virus, a coronavirus like the common cold, is shown in pink in this electron micrograph image from the Centers for Disease Control.  Read More
2020-01-19	Beijing (CNN) A mysterious respiratory virus that has killed at least three people and sickened more than 200 in China can be transmitted between humans, a Chinese government-appointed expert has said, fueling fears about the possibility of a deadly epidemic as millions prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Zhong Nanshan, head of the team set up by China's National Health Commission to investigate the pneumonia-like virus, confirmed that at least two cases had been spread from person to person and medical staff had also been infected.  Authorities had previously said that the new strain of coronavirus , which was traced by health officials to a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, was primarily passed from animals to humans.  But at least two people have become infected in recent days, despite living hundreds of miles from Wuhan.  "The current cases show there is definitely human-to-human transmission," Zhong told Chinese state-run CCTV, explaining that two people in China's Guangdong province were infected by a family member who had recently returned from Wuhan.

2020-01-20	Hong Kong (CNN) Governments around the world have always struggled to stop the spread of disease, from the deadly swine flu which struck the globe in 2009, to ongoing attempts to rein in Ebola in West Africa .  No health authority has ever tackled the challenge currently faced by China , however, as the country grapples with a new coronavirus just as hundreds of millions prepare to travel during the Lunar New Year period -- the largest annual human migration on Earth.  During the Lunar holiday, people from across the country will cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Others will take advantage of the time off to holiday overseas. Last year, close to 7 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad for Lunar New Year, according to state media.  The holiday -- the most important in the Chinese calendar -- comes at the worst possible time for health authorities racing to contain the outbreak which has put the rest of Asia on alert.  Medical staff members carry a patient into Wuhan's Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by the Wuhan coronavirus are being treated, on January 18, 2020.  The virus, which was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, is known to have infected more than 300 people and spread to at least three other countries already. On Monday, China's National Health Commission confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus can be passed from human-to-human and that medical staff had also been infected.  The spread of the mysterious respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States , is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year.  "One of the consequences of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly than was the case 50 years ago," said Mike Turner, director of science at the Wellcome Trust, a UK-based global health charity.  More cases have also been reported within China, evidence that the outbreak has spread well beyond Wuhan, creating a risk of unpredictable further infection.  As of Tuesday morning, five cases have been confirmed in Beijing, two in Shanghai, and 14 in the southern province of Guangdong -- all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Additional suspected cases have been reported across the country, from eastern Shandong province to Sichuan province in the southwest.  Chinese scientists on January 8 identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus , the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In 2002 and 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia, spreading as far as Canada.  During a news conference Monday, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese government-appointed expert who helped discover the SARS coronavirus, said the infectiousness of the new Wuhan coronavirus was not as strong as SARS, but that the disease was "climbing" and suggested that the "death rate at the moment is not so representative." Since December, four people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus have died.  Uncertainties about the Wuhan coronavirus -- including its unidentified source -- have prompted fears there may be more people infected than currently reported.  Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who heads the Wellcome Trust, said the outbreak is "extremely concerning."  "It is possible that often mild symptoms, and probability of people being affected and infectious without experiencing symptoms, from this coronavirus may be masking the true numbers of people who have been infected, and the extent of person to person transmission," said Farrar.  Initial symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus include fever and coughing -- which are also common flu symptoms, a viral infection prevalent in the winter months. Some patients infected with the coronavirus also have difficulty breathing and invasive lesions on the lungs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  The WHO will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak in China.  Transportation hub  The recent spike in confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases appears to point to a wider area of contamination. According to a recent study by Imperial College London, the number of infections in Wuhan itself are likely a gross underestimation, raising the risk that carriers of the virus may have already traveled elsewhere within China before screening measures were put in place.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday that since the outbreak, China has been taking active measures to handle the epidemic and formulate prevention and control plans.  China's National Health Commission said Sunday that the situation of the outbreak is "still preventable and controllable."  The more than 200 cases officially confirmed in China is a far cry from the 1,700 the British researchers estimate to have been infected by January 12. The UK team based their calculations on the number of cases reported already in Thailand and Japan, and the estimated number of people departing Wuhan's international airport.  More than 60 routes connect Wuhan with other countries, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.  Governments around the world have begun responding to the perceived threat. On Tuesday, Australia said it is adding border measures for flights from Wuhan to Sydney. The US also announced screening measures for passengers arriving from Wuhan at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles last week, following similar measures taken by governments in Asia.  In Wuhan itself, infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.  Those measures were only put in place five weeks after the initial outbreak, meaning countless passengers have left the city without undergoing any screening.  Nor is it clear that the screening or heightened attention in Wuhan is working: the woman diagnosed with the coronavirus in South Korea had visited a doctor in the city after developing a fever and muscle pains. She was prescribed cold medicine and sent on her way.  This photo taken on February 10, 2018 shows passengers travelling on a crowded train during the 26-hour journey from Beijing to Chengdu, as they head home ahead of the Lunar New Year.  Cover-up concerns  The legacy of SARS hangs long over the current outbreak. During that pandemic, the Chinese government was initially slow to release information, censoring news and downplaying the severity of the outbreak. The lack of transparency sparked backlash at home and drew heavy criticism from foreign governments and the WHO.  In April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a coverup. Later in the month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak.  This time around, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared the outbreak on December 31, three weeks after the first patient developed symptoms. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen a week later and shared the genome sequence of the virus with the WHO -- a speedy response that earned praise from the WHO and scientists around the world.  The Wuhan health commission has also been posting frequent -- and now daily -- updates on the latest infection numbers on its website, but that has failed to allay fears over the disease spreading.  The Wuhan health commission announced Monday that 136 new cases had been diagnosed on Saturday and Sunday, including one death. The number was a significant jump from the 62 reported during the weekend, but far short of the estimate by the Imperial College London researchers.  The WHO said the spike in reported cases was the result of "increased searching and testing" of the virus among people with respiratory illness.  JUST WATCHED This may explain the spread of China's new virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This may explain the spread of China's new virus 03:38  Before this weekend, Wuhan authorities had maintained for two weeks that no new cases had been detected since January 3. Even as cases were confirmed overseas, there was a complete lack of information on potential infections elsewhere in China, leading to a growing sense of unease and accusations of a coverup by local or national authorities.  On Weibo, a Twitter-like social media service, many people questioned the silence from the provincial authorities in particular, pointing out the unlikeliness that only those people who left the country were found to be carrying the virus.  "Does it mean that Wuhan residents only travel abroad but not to other (Chinese) cities?" one user asked in a popular post.  Increased concerns around person-to-person transmission, combined with the mass travel expected in the coming weeks, will have health authorities -- and the public -- on edge to see just how far the new virus spreads.  On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed authorities to take "resolute efforts" to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, the first time the country's leader has publicly spoken on the outbreak.  According to a statement carried on state news agency Xinhua, Xi "stressed putting people's safety and health as the top priority" and urged relevant departments to release information promptly and deepen international cooperation.
2020-01-20	(CNN) The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus that has infected hundreds and killed four in Asia.  "The NIH is in the process of taking the first steps towards the development of a vaccine," said Dr. Anthony Fauc i, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Fauci said it would take a few months until the first phase of the clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.  The latest  The virus, which was first reported at the end of December, has infected more than 200 people, according to a Chinese government-appointed expert. The bulk of the cases have been in China, but there have been four cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.  The virus originated in animals and can be spread from person to person. While most of the patients visited an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, a city about 700 miles south of Beijing, some did not.  Working on a vaccine  A team of scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  "The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats," Hotez said.  He added that it's less challenging to develop a vaccine for coronaviruses than for other viruses such as HIV or influenza.  "Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target," Hotez said.  If a vaccine is developed, he said, health care workers might be among the first to receive it because they're exposed to infected patients.  It is "remarkable" that scientists are able to start developing a vaccine for a virus that was identified less than a month ago, he said.  He credited Chinese researchers, who quickly sequenced and published the virus's genome.  "With SARS, it took almost a year to be able to identify and map the full genetic code," he said. "Now we're doing this in just a few weeks."  'An evolving situation'  Fauci emphasized there are still many questions about this new virus.  "This is an evolving situation, and it's tough to predict ultimately where it will go," he said. "But we have to take it very seriously."  A few things are clear. One, the virus jumped from animals to humans, just like SARS did nearly two decades ago.  He added it's unclear whether just one type of animal is transmitting the virus to humans, or more than one type.

He also said while it's clear this new virus can be spread from person to person, it's unclear how easily that spread can happen.  "Is it a continual spread? Is it sustained? We're not quite sure yet," he said.  Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed there are many questions.  "This is one of those inflection moments in outbreak history where we have enough information to be very concerned, but not enough information to say this is going to be an international crisis," he said.
2020-01-21	(CNN) The United States has its first confirmed case of a new virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, last month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday. The coronavirus has already sickened hundreds and killed six people in Asia.  CDC officials said the United States will be more strict about health screenings of airplane passengers arriving from Wuhan.  The patient, who is not being named, is in isolation at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington. He is in his 30s and lives in Snohomish County, Washington, just north of Seattle. He had recently returned from Wuhan.  He arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15, before any health screenings for the Wuhan coronavirus began at US airports. He sought medical care on January 19. The CDC and Washington state are now tracing the people he was in contact with to see if he might have spread the disease to someone else.  "We believe the risk to the public is low," said John Wiesman, secretary of health for the state of Washington.  The patient became ill four days after arriving in the United States and sought care. Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, doctors suspected the novel Wuhan coronavirus and sent specimens to the CDC in Atlanta, where tests Monday confirmed the virus.  The patient is faring well but is still being kept in isolation out of an abundance of caution, health officials said.  Health screenings at more US airports  Soon, passengers from Wuhan to the United States, whether on direct or indirect flights, will only be allowed to land at one of the five US airports doing health screenings. Screenings include a temperature check and observation for symptoms such as a cough and trouble breathing.  Last weekend, the CDC started health screenings for Wuhan passengers arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.  Starting this week, Wuhan passengers will also be screened at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport.  The CDC raised its travel notice for Wuhan, China, from level 1 to level 2 of three possible levels, according to its website . As of Tuesday afternoon, the agency advised travelers to "practice enhanced precautions." The highest level, "Warning - Level 3," advises travelers to "avoid nonessential travel."  Person-to-person transmission of Wuhan virus  The Wuhan coronavirus is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS , which killed more than 700 people in 2002 and 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.  To date, the Wuhan coronavirus has infected more than 300 people and killed six in an outbreak that has struck China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and now the US.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  It's not known how many of the cases became infected from animals and how many from another person.  On Tuesday, the CDC activated its emergency response system in response to the Wuhan coronavirus. The CDC activates this system on a temporary basis to centralize how the agency monitors, prepares for and responds to public health threats.  The outbreak started in late December at an animal market in Wuhan, about 700 miles south of Beijing. The virus can jump from animals to people.  While there's much to learn about how easily the virus can be transmitted human-to-human, health officials said it appears that it's not spread as easily as some other viruses.  "This isn't anywhere near in the same category as measles or the flu," Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, told CNN.
2020-01-21	The spread of the respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and now the United States, is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year.  Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected, announced a series of new measures Tuesday, including the cancellation of upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations, which had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people.  Tour agencies have been banned from taking groups out of Wuhan and the number of thermal monitors and screening areas in public spaces will be increased. Traffic police will also conduct spot checks on private vehicles coming in and out of the city to look for live poultry or wild animals, after the virus was linked to a seafood and live animal market, according to a report by state media outlet the People's Daily, citing Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission.  The new measures come after Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered "resolute efforts to curb the spread" of the virus Monday.  There are now fears, however, that efforts to contain it are coming too late, hampered by a slow-moving Chinese bureaucracy which failed to put sufficient measures in place in time.  In the coming days, hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to begin traveling across the country and overseas as the annual Lunar New Year break gets fully underway, compounding concerns of a further spike in cases.  Though infections were first detected in Wuhan in mid-December, infrared temperature screening areas were not installed in the city's airports and stations until January 14, according to state media.  More than 440 cases of the virus have been confirmed across China, with the majority in Wuhan itself, but also as far afield as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province, near Hong Kong.  The death toll rose to nine Wednesday morning. Among the victims are a 66-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman who died on January 20, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The majority of those who have died as a result of the virus have been elderly and had pre-existing conditions.  Cases confirmed worldwide  Around a month after the virus was first identified in Wuhan, it has already spread well beyond mainland China.  In Asia, cases have been detected in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan, while authorities in the US confirmed their first case on Tuesday and there have been reports of potential cases in Australia.  Despite initial reports that the virus was unlikely to spread between humans, Chinese health authorities have now said there is "definitely human-to-human transmission." One patient is believed to have infected as many as 14 medical staff in one hospital, suggesting the disease can be spread far more easily than previously thought.  The specter of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003, has loomed large over discussion of the current virus.  During the SARS outbreak, Chinese authorities initially downplayed the dangers and censored coverage, preventing people from realizing the severity of the virus and taking action in time to stop its spread.  Zhong Nanshan, an expert with China's National Health Commission who is investigating the Wuhan virus, told state media Monday that while it is not as serious as SARS, the number of people with the disease was "climbing" and suggested that the "death rate at the moment is not so representative."  A study by researchers in the UK estimated that the number of infections in Wuhan is still grossly underestimated , with the real number closer to 1,700, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.  US authorities announced the country's first confirmed case on Tuesday. The patient, a young man, had been traveling and arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington state before health screenings for the virus began.  Travelers wear face masks as they walk outside of the Beijing Railway Station in Beijing, Monday, January 20, 2020.  Worldwide effort  Even before cases were detected in other countries, the efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus were international. Wuhan alone has connections to dozens of overseas destinations, and Beijing and Shanghai have hundreds more.  Airports across Asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the US with connections to Wuhan, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  With all indications that the virus has a relatively slow incubation time, however, these efforts may be insufficient to stop its spread.  "You cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this. The incubation period is probably a week," Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Tuesday . "It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure people with a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention."  He said that while there was no cause for immediate alarm, the true number of cases was likely far higher than currently reported and urged people to be vigilant about potential symptoms.  Australian authorities on Tuesday quarantined a man in Brisbane who had returned from Wuhan with possible symptoms of the coronavirus. He will remain in isolation until his symptoms have resolved, Queensland Health authorities said.  Raising concerns about how difficult it is to detect those with the virus, even if they have some symptoms, a patient in South Korea told doctors there she had developed a fever and muscle pains on Saturday and was prescribed cold medicine by a doctor in Wuhan, before being sent on her way. She was later confirmed to have the coronavirus during a check in Seoul.  In the US, the National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine for the new virus, though it will take at least a few months until the first phase of clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.  Scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  "The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats," Hotez told CNN.  The World Health Organization will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of "international concern" and what recommendations should be made to help manage its spread.
2020-01-22	Washington state health officials said Wednesday that investigators have identified 16 “close contacts” of a 30-year-old man who is the first confirmed case of coronavirus diagnosed in the United States.  The Snohomish County resident, who has not been named, identified people that he has interacted with since returning from Wuhan. Those named will be actively monitored for signs of any illness by local health officials.  Health officials said that they consider a “close contact” to be anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected person, like having a meal or meetings together, but that they are not asking those contacts to isolate themselves unless they have symptoms.  Health staff will reach out to the contacts daily to see if they have a fever or cough and to check if they develop any symptoms. Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer for the Snohomish Health District, said there is also a call center set up to take resident’s questions about the virus.
2020-01-22	Hong Kong (CNN) The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus has risen to 17, as dozens more cases were reported across China and as far afield as the western United States , sparking fears of a possible pandemic.  On Wednesday, the Chinese city of Wuhan -- where the virus was first identified -- said it would "temporarily" close its airport and railway stations for departing passengers. All public transport services will also be suspended, as authorities attempt to contain the virus.  The city lockdown begins at 10 am local time Thursday (9 pm ET Wednesday), according to an announcement from the city's coronavirus command center.  Chinese health authorities said that at least 547 cases had been confirmed in the mainland, with eight new deaths linked to the virus in Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital. Cases were also confirmed in the Chinese territory of Macao and the self-governing island of Taiwan.  Beyond China, officials in Washington state on Tuesday confirmed the first case on US soil. The patient is a male in his 30s who is under observation at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, said John Wiesman, Washington's secretary of health, at a press conference Wednesday.  Health officials have reviewed the travel history of the patient, said Dr. Chris Spitters, Snohomish Health District acting health officer on the patient's contact investigation. "As of now, there are at least 16 identified close contacts," Spitters said. "Local health departments started reaching out to them yesterday and continued doing so today."  Spitters said "the risk to the general public remains low and the public health system and our health care partners are working swiftly and collaboratively to address this situation."  Cases have also been reported in South Korea, Thailand and Japan, and suspected cases detected in Australia.  Worldwide, a total of 555 cases have been confirmed since the outbreak was detected in mid-December.  However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet declared the virus a "public health emergency of international concern," which might merit a coordinated global response.  The organization's emergency committee met Wednesday in Geneva, but decided more information was needed to declare the status of the outbreak and what recommendations should be made regarding it. It is expected to take up the matter again on Thursday.  China on Tuesday announced it was adopting Class A prevention and control measures, typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients. China previously used such measures in 2009 to tackle an outbreak of H1N1, introducing mandatory quarantine for anyone who had "close contact" with an infected person, including foreigners arriving in the country from areas where H1N1 outbreaks had been reported.  Li Bin, China's national health commissioner, said that officials are aware of around 2,200 cases of "close contact" with known virus carriers. Regarding suspected cases, 715 patients have been discharged while more than 300 patients remain on medical watch.  The disease is mainly transmitted "through the respiratory tract," said Li, adding that "there is possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease."  While there are indications that Chinese authorities are ready to ramp up controls on travel -- including ordering that all trips to Wuhan be canceled and refunded -- it remains to be seen whether the virus, already reported in around a dozen locations, can be reined in before the Lunar New Year travel period truly kicks in.  The largest annual human migration on Earth, hundreds of millions of people will travel across China and overseas during the four-week period, which began in mid-January and continues until February. Many will go by train or plane, raising the risk of infection as they are put in close contact with other travelers  JUST WATCHED Gupta: Here's what's keeping health officials up at night Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gupta: Here's what's keeping health officials up at night 02:36  What we know about the virus  First identified in Wuhan in mid-December, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is in the same family of infections as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).  Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city which was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species. SARS was previously linked to similar markets, particularly the sale of civet cats, a delicacy in some parts of China.  Speaking Wednesday, Li, the Chinese health official, said that Wuhan and Hubei provincial authorities should tighten the regulation of farm markets and wild animals. He also urged the public to avoid crowds and minimize large gatherings.  Chinese health officials said human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed, raising the chance of its spread. In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient unknown to be carrying the virus were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.  People were seen at a train station Wednesday trying to get train tickets to leave Wuhan.  People in a ticket line trying to get out of Wuhan in Wuchang train station in China.  The true extent of the virus is unclear, and official figures may be an underestimation. A study by British researchers previously estimated -- based on the spread of the virus overseas in a relatively short time -- that the number of people infected in Wuhan alone was likely around 1,700.  However, so far the death toll is relatively low, and almost all cases involved elderly people with preexisting conditions: of the more than 400 confirmed cases in China, nine deaths have been reported so far, or 2.25%. By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of around 10%, and was even more deadly among vulnerable populations.  Medical staff transfer patients to Jin Yintan hospital on January 17, 2020 in Wuhan, China.  Worldwide effort  With cases and suspected cases already reported across Asia and now as far afield as the US and Australia, containment efforts are being put in place in many travel hubs.  Wuhan alone has connections with more than 60 overseas destinations through its international airport, while Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, all of which have reported cases, have hundreds more.  Airports across Asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the US, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Officials at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport put up signs at the international arrivals area instructing travelers from Wuhan to watch for symptoms of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started displaying the sign in English and Chinese on January 14, an airport spokesman said.  A sign at the international arrivals area of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport instructs travelers coming from Wuhan, China, to watch for symptoms of coronavirus.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a statement saying it was closely monitoring developments and is actively working with the WHO secretariat, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the CDC.  With all indications that the virus has a relatively slow incubation time, however, these efforts may be insufficient to stop its spread.  "You cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this. The incubation period is probably a week," Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Tuesday .

In the US, the National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine for the new virus, though it will take at least a few months until the first phase of clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.  Scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  "The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats," Hotez told CNN.
2020-01-22	An outbreak of new coronavirus has sickened about 1,400 people worldwide and killed at least 41 in mainland China, while spreading to countries around the world.  Its emergence has fueled fears of a deadly epidemic as hundreds of millions of people travel in China, or around the Asian region, during the Lunar New Year holiday.  What is the virus?  Coronavirus is a large family of viruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).  Common symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and possibly a headache. Those who have a weakened immune system, particularly the young and the elderly, are at risk of the virus turning into a more serious respiratory tract illness.  Authorities said the Wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems.  It is thought to be milder that SARS and MERS and take longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital.  Experts are now trying to understand how it is being transmitted, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community.  In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient -- who was not known to be carrying the virus -- were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.  Where is this happening?  Where it started: Ground zero  The outbreak emerged last month in the largest city in central China, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province.  Officials linked it to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, saying wild animals sold there are the likely source of the virus. The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection and officials are scrambling to discover its animal source.  Snakes -- the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra -- may be responsible for transmitting coronavirus to humans.  Scientists in China say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, and then to humans.  However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal.  At least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions.  As deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of New Year celebrations in Wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.  Regional spread  From the first reported case in December, in Hubei province, the virus has spread to almost all of China's administrative regions this week.  The country has adopted prevention and control measures that are typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.  Wuhan "temporarily" closed its airport and railway stations on Thursday for departing passengers, and all public transport services are suspended until further notice.  The city's coronavirus task force also announced the closure of highways out of the city.  Meanwhile, the city made it mandatory for everyone to wear face masks in public places after confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 500 mark.  Unprecedented lockdown  Authorities in China have imposed indefinite travel restrictions in 15 cities in Hubei province, the most affected area in the country, impacting an estimated 32 million people.  Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is under effective lockdown, with all public transport in and out of the city closed.  Other cities across the province are under less severe travel restrictions.  A global threat: Confirmed cases around the world  The virus has spread well beyond mainland China, so far to 13 places including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Australia and the United States.  Airports around the world have increased health screenings and implemented new quarantine procedures as officials race to slow the spread of the virus.  International flights from Wuhan  Wuhan is a major transportation hub.  Not only is the city a center for China's high-speed rail network, it has flights going to more than 60 international destinations from Tianhe International Airport.  On Thursday, as confirmed cases ramped up across the country, government officials announced the temporary closure of Wuhan's airport and railway stations.  All train tickets in and out of Wuhan have also been suspended, while multiple international airlines have canceled flights to the city.  China has encouraged passengers traveling to and from Wuhan to change their travel plans during the busy Lunar New Year holiday period, by exempting them from service charges for refunds for all modes of transport.  How does this compare to the SARS virus?  Scientists say the infectiousness of the virus is not as strong as SARS, but have added that the number of people infected is climbing.  A study by researchers in the UK estimated that the number of infections in Wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 4,000 as of January 18, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time.  SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003.  On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a World Health Organization committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought.  But there is still much that is not known about the virus and, as the above graphic shows, its death rate is far smaller than that seen during the SARS outbreak.
2020-01-22	Wuhan, China (CNN) The Lunar New Year -- the most important festival in the Chinese calendar -- is just three days away, but in the Chinese city of Wuhan, there are few reasons to celebrate.  A deadly outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in this city of 11 million people last month. Within weeks, the virus has killed nine people , sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.  Wuhan has been on high alert since the number of confirmed infections surged into the hundreds earlier this week.  New year celebrations that had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people have been canceled. In some parts of the city, including a major shopping area, streets remain largely empty, with most people walking outside donning face masks.  In the city's center, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sits empty, its rows of stalls shuttered. Police and security officers in face masks stand guard outside, prohibiting anyone from filming or entering a cordoned off area.  The market has always been a popular spot at this time of the year, packed with shoppers stocking up on fish and seafood for Lunar New Year feasts with family and friends.  But this year, Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at this market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  The virus -- which can infect humans and animals -- has since spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Officials in Washington state confirmed the first case on US soil Tuesday.  The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection, but health authorities have not found out which animals are the source.  'How can I not be worried?'  Not far from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Xiao Chuan'an, from a neighboring city, is selling sugar cane she imported from southern Guangdong province.  "I do feel a bit scared," she told CNN. "How can I not be worried? The situation sounds really serious. The news on the phone sounds really scary."  The country's National Health Commission confirmed this week the virus can be transmitted between people, after Wuhan health authorities maintained for two weeks that there was "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission."  The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been linked to the coronavirus outbreak in China.  A staff member talks with a driver as he checks the body temperatures of passengers at an exit of a highway in Wuhan on Tuesday.  In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, 270 people have been infected as of Wednesday, and nine of them have died, according to the commission. At least 453 cases had been confirmed throughout China, leading to fears of a possible epidemic.  Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said.  "You can see now -- does it look like the atmosphere of Chinese New Year?" she said. "I don't know when the pneumonia epidemic will stop... I might have to eat instant noodles during Chinese New Year."  A hospital in Wuhan, where China's coronavirus outbreak first emerged.  Emergency measures  The city government announced a series of new measures Tuesday to contain the outbreak -- efforts some critics say came too late -- the virus has already spread to a dozen provinces across the country.  Tour agencies in Wuhan have been banned from taking groups out of the city. Infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.  Staff members disinfect the Hankou Railway Station in Wuhan on Wednesday.  The city has over 60 routes connecting Wuhan with international cities, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. It is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.  At the high-speed rail station, the only faces that stand out are the uncovered ones, with the vast majority of passengers donning masks. As they prepare to exit the station, a railway staff member -- also wearing a mask and gloves -- puts a thermometer at the head of each passenger, checking for a fever.  Commuters wearing face masks walk in Hankou railway station in Wuhan, where China's coronavirous outbreak first emerged last month.  On a high speed train from Beijing to Wuhan, railway attendants and security guards left their faces uncovered. A train attendant told CNN they were asked by management not to wear masks, as it may trigger a panic among passengers.  But she added that the train company is preparing to purchase masks and they will begin wearing them should the situation worsen.  Some hotels in the city said they will also screen guests, checking their temperature and asking them to sanitize their hands upon entry.  Commuters wait in line at Wuchang railway station in Wuhan on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, the general manager of the Westin hotel in Wuhan told CNN he had asked staff to start wearing face masks "for both their safety and for the safety of our guests."  Others, however, are less worried about the outbreak. Yan Weixi, a jackfruit seller who did not wear a mask, said she did not find the situation "so scary."  "I have been checking online instructions... like drinking more water or washing your hands more frequently. I think that should be fine," said Yan, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is spending her first Lunar New Year in Wuhan.  "The most important thing is to keep a positive attitude, because if you're more scared, it's more likely you would catch the virus," she said. "That's my opinion."
2020-01-22	Jennifer Williams, adviser to Vice President Mike Pence for European and Russian affairs, returns to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on November 19. Win McNamee/Getty Images  At the end of tonight’s proceedings in the Senate impeachment trial, Chief Justice John Roberts said a “a single one paged classified document identified by the House managers for filing with the Secretary of the Senate” will be made available for senators to review in a classified setting.  The document pertains to supplemental testimony from Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence who testified before the House impeachment inquiry in November.  “On November 26, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee received supplemental testimony from Jennifer Williams, assistant to Vice President Mike Pence. On December 11, 2019, after consultation with the ranking minority member, Chairman Schiff transmitted that supplemental testimony to the House Judiciary Committee to be made part of the record in consideration of articles of impeachment," a Democratic official working on the impeachment trial said in a written statement.  The official added: “Although there appears to be no basis for keeping it classified, the Office of the Vice President has ignored two requests to declassify this document. This supplemental testimony will allow the Senate to see further corroborative evidence as it considers articles of impeachment, and, if declassified, it would provide the public further understanding of the events in question.”  More on Williams' testimony from November: Williams described President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in her deposition as "inappropriate." Trump's July 25 call is at the center of the impeachment trial, in which a whistleblower complaint alleges Trump asked for dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential rival, and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.

It was Mother's Day in the United States. In pictures: The novel coronavirus outbreak  Brynn Anderson/AP Mary Faye Cochran sings "You Are My Sunshine" to her son Stacey Smith from her senior-living facility in Smyrna, Georgia, on Sunday, May 10. It was Mother's Day in the United States.  The novel coronavirus has now spread across the world.  The illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province. It has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica, and many countries have declared a national emergency.  The World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, the first since the H1N1 flu in 2009.  Coronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold or flu. But for those with a weaker immune system, the virus could cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis.
2020-01-23	(CNN) Authorities have widened a travel lockdown in central China, ring-fencing millions of residents in a race to contain a deadly virus that is spreading throughout Asia and across the world.  The clampdown -- which comes amid the Lunar New Year, China's busiest travel period -- reflects mounting fears that the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus could give rise to a pandemic. The virus has killed at least 25 people in China, several of whom did not have pre-existing conditions before they contracted the illness, with more than 830 infected.  Still, the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee said Thursday it was too early to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.  Earlier in the day, David Heymann, the chairman of a WHO committee gathering data on the virus, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought.  It initially appeared to spread only by very close contact that would typically occur within a family -- such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating utensils -- but now evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus, such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else's face.  He said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles.  Mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland China, with various countries reporting their first cases.  In Scotland, five people were tested for suspected coronavirus after traveling from Wuhan.  Hong Kong confirmed two cases of the virus and Singapore confirmed its first, a 66-year-old Chinese national who had also been in Wuhan.  Saudi Arabia has denied there are any cases of the virus in its territory, following reports that an Indian nurse working in the country had been diagnosed.  China's race to contain it  Wuhan -- ground zero for the pneumonia-like respiratory virus -- "temporarily" closed its airport and railway stations on Thursday for departing passengers. All public transport services in the city of 11 million people have also been suspended until further notice.  On Thursday afternoon, transport authorities began shutting down some of the main highways leaving Wuhan, according to state news agency Xinhua.  The wearing of face masks is now mandatory in all public places in the city, including hotels, restaurants, parks, cafes, and shopping malls.  "People who don't obey the requirements shall be dealt with by authorities in accordance with their respective duties and laws," a statement from Wuhan's municipal government said on Wednesday.  Authorities in Huanggang, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Wuhan, announced a series of similar measures cutting off the city as of midnight local time (11 a.m. ET on Thursday).  Government officials said in a statement that the city's subway and train stations will close, per a report in the People's Daily, a state-run newspaper. All theaters, internet cafes and indoor public culture, tourism and entertainment facilities in the city will also stop business, People's Daily reported.  Hundreds of thousands of people will likely be affected. The entire administrative area of Huanggang has a population of 7.5 million, but People's Daily reported that the lockdown only applies to the urban area, which is only a part of the total population.  In Ezhou, the city's railway station has been closed "in order to fully conduct prevention and control of the new type of pneumonia ... effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people," according to a statement from city's Coronavirus Disease Prevention Control Headquarters on Thursday.  There was an unusual flurry of activity around the train stations in Wuhan early Thursday morning, as passengers -- most of them wearing face masks -- scrambled to leave the city before the lockdown began. Families were seen unloading their cars and hurrying to get into lines that already stretched outside the doors.  Travelers at Wuhan's Hankou railway station queue to leave the city early on Thursday morning before the citywide lockdown came into effect.  At Wuhan's Hankou railway station, one of the country's busiest high-speed rail hubs, officials used thermal detectors to scan for potential fevers as dozens of passengers filed through the security screening. Inside, crowds were shoulder to shoulder as they waited for trains out of the city.  The mass exodus was met with anger from many users of the Weibo microblogging platform.  "Wuhan people, get out of Shanghai," one person posted. "Don't sneak in and spread chaos."  Others shared their fears over the virus, and cautionary warnings. "Don't panic and try not to go out," one person said.  Another person posted they had considered fleeing Wuhan. "I was thinking about my parents and children -- if I bring them, where can we escape to?"  The decision to stop trains and planes to and from Wuhan comes shortly before Lunar New Year begins on January 25 amid what is considered the biggest human migration on the planet, with hundreds of millions of people visiting families and traveling in China or throughout Asia.  Inside Wuhan, the epicenter  Wuhan is one of China's most important cities. Located on the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River, it is considered the political and economic capital of central China.  For those remaining in the city, there is a sense of unease. Jan Renders, a 29-year-old PhD student in Wuhan, told CNN that many shops are closing for the Lunar New Year holiday, so people had already been stocking up on supplies. He said he was able to buy enough food for at least a week.  "But of course people aren't sure whether shops will be going back to normal soon," he said.  Another man in Wuhan sent CNN a photo inside a grocery store Thursday morning that showed several empty shelves. The man, who asked not to be identified, said most of the food was sold out.  The Wuhan New-type Coronavirus Pneumonia Command -- a task-force set up to deal with the crisis -- said in a statement that Wuhan has a sufficient supply and reserve of food, medical supplies and commodities.  "There is no need for the general public of the city to panic or hoard in order to prevent unnecessary wastes," the command said.  The scale of the challenge facing authorities tasked with implementing the blockade is immense. By way of comparison, the lockdown is akin to closing down all transport links for a city more than three times the size of Chicago, two days before Christmas.  "The Chinese new year is the most important festival for Chinese. And many of the mobile population, they're coming from rural China to work in Wuhan, and now you ask them not to leave to see their relatives, that is difficult," professor Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading microbiologist, told CNN.  Yuen was part of a group of high-level experts who visited Wuhan earlier this week and recommended on Sunday that the Chinese central government should stop people traveling to and from the city.  "It has to be done," he said. "If you allow people to go out of Wuhan, especially those who may have symptoms, then the exported case numbers will continue to surge, and that is not a good thing for the whole outbreak control."  "The mainland government policy now is that nobody should leave Wuhan and nobody should come into Wuhan," he continued.  A growing number of cases  Chinese health authorities said on Friday that at least 830 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus had been confirmed. The death toll rose on Friday to 25, from 17 the day before -- with all but one of those deaths in Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital.  The other death was in Hebei province, close to Beijing.  Cases of the virus have now been reported in nearly every Chinese province, with two cases confirmed in Macao, and two in Hong Kong. The self-governing island of Taiwan has also confirmed a case.  Beyond China, officials in Washington state said on Tuesday that a man in his 30s is the first confirmed case on US soil . A total of nine cases have also been reported in Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam.  The true extent of the Wuhan coronavirus is unclear, however, and official figures may be an underestimation as mild symptoms and delayed onset mean cases are likely to have been undetected, a team of scientists have said.  Scientists at Imperial College London estimate that around 4,000 people are likely to have been infected in Wuhan city alone as of January 18.  Passengers wearing face masks onboard one of the last trains to leave Wuhan before a citywide lockdown came into effect.  What we know about the virus  Officially called the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the contagion is in the same family of infections as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS infected 8,000 people and caused 774 deaths in 2002 and 2003.  Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of China that was sold in similar markets.  Chinese health officials said human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed, raising the chance of its spread. In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient unknown to be carrying the virus were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily.  The disease is mainly transmitted "through the respiratory tract," Li Bin, China's national health commissioner said on Wednesday, adding that "there is possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease."  Li said that Wuhan and Hubei provincial authorities should tighten the regulation of farm markets and wild animals. He also urged the public to avoid crowds and minimize large gatherings.  China on Tuesday announced it was adopting Class A prevention and control measures, typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. The designation has given health officials sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients.  China previously used such measures in 2009 to tackle an outbreak of H1N1, introducing mandatory quarantine for anyone who had "close contact" with an infected person, including foreigners arriving in the country from areas where H1N1 outbreaks had been reported.  International containment efforts  Japanese officers work at a health screening station as they observe passengers arriving on a flight from Wuhan, China.  As officials race to slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, containment efforts are being put in place in many travel hubs.  Airports around the world are increasing health screenings and implementing new quarantine procedures, including in major airports in the US, Thailand, Singapore and Australia.  Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) has halted the sale of high-speed railway tickets to and from Wuhan, according to its public relations manager Dobie Yam.  Several countries, including the UK and Japan, have advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan.  However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet declared the virus a "public health emergency of international concern," which might merit a coordinated global response.  The organization's emergency committee met Wednesday in Geneva, but decided more information was needed to declare the status of the outbreak and what recommendations should be made regarding it. It is expected to take up the matter again on Thursday.  Meanwhile, a senior State Department official said Wednesday the United States is concerned about transparency inside the Chinese government on the Wuhan coronavirus.  "I do believe that the concern you see both inside China and internationally is a reflection of what we've seen in the past. 2003 was SARS, and a number of issues, where the government has been slow to respond out of fear of embarrassment or making things look worse than they are. And that reluctance to respond in a rapid manner doesn't give the global community a secure feeling for this being managed inside China," the official said.
2020-01-23	(CNN) Of all the alarming aspects of the rapidly spreading new virus out Wuhan, China, this is perhaps the most alarming: A single patient has infected 14 health care workers.  That's what's called a "super spreader," and disease detectives are hot on that patient's trail. It's one element to stopping the spread of this coronavirus that's killed 17 people and infected more than 500 in five different countries, including the United States.  CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China  CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China 02:45  CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China  Super spreaders are a crucial part of a disease outbreak. Think about Mary Mallon, or "Typhoid Mary," who was responsible for widely spreading typhoid in New York City in the early 1900s. Or the Chinese doctor who in 2003 spread SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome, to four different countries. Or the single patient at a South Korean hospital who in 2015 infected 82 people with MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.  The Wuhan virus is a cousin of SARS and MERS. All three are coronaviruses.  The presence of a super spreader in Wuhan indicates that the virus can spread with some ease, said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.  He calls them "super shedders," since they shed the virus -- for example, in sneezes or coughs -- in larger quantities than most other people.  "You only need one super shedder to say, 'This dog is going to hunt,' " he said. "It really does speak to the potential for this virus to be transmitted."  He added that there are probably more super spreaders -- or shedders -- of the Wuhan coronavirus than this one patient.  "If we have one super shedder, that tells us we're going to have more super shedders," he said. "If there's one, there will be more."  Osterholm's team at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is investigating the super spreader, and their research shows there might be more health care workers in or near Wuhan who've become infected than the 14 mentioned by the health official earlier this week.  Super spreaders in coronavirus outbreaks  On Tuesday, the mayor of Wuhan said one patient spread the coronavirus to a doctor and 13 nurses.  The mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said a patient wasn't screened for the virus before being admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan for neurosurgery, and after surgery developed a fever. Zhou, who spoke on CCTV, the state-run television station, did not specify when this occurred.  Osterholm said his team's research shows that 20 health care workers have been infected by patients, with the other six cases possibly at hospitals in Wuhan and the nearby city of Huanggang.  Public health officials are trying to avoid devastating super spreader events that happened with SARS and MERS.  In 2003, a Chinese doctor who was staying at the Metropole Hotel in the city of Guangzhou infected other hotel guests who then traveled back to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. In Singapore alone, 94 cases of SARS can be traced back to the hotel, according to WHO  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  In 2015, there were five super-spreading events of MERS at hospitals in South Korea. In one case, a single patient spread the infection to 82 other people.
2020-01-23	Pierre Albouy/AFP/Getty Images  The Wuhan coronavirus does not yet constitute a public health emergency of international concern, according to an emergency committee convened by the World Health Organization.  "The advice to the [director-general], which is provided by the emergency committee, is that now is not the time” and that it is "too early to consider that this event is a public health emergency of international concern,” committee chairman Dr. Didier Houssin told reporters Thursday.  The announcement came shortly after the committee was convened over two days in Geneva to advise WHO leadership on the outbreak. The organization was expected to make an announcement Wednesday, but WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus then told reporters that he did not have enough information to make a decision, and the committee was asked to reconvene a second day.  WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as "an extraordinary event" that constitutes a "public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease" and "to potentially require a coordinated international response." Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1.  While Ghebreyesus praised the Chinese government and its cooperation with WHO on Wednesday, Houssin then expressed that the information they had from Chinese authorities was too limited and imprecise for the committee to make a recommendation that day. The committee remained divided — roughly 50/50 — over the course of the two-day meeting, Houssin said Thursday.  Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have told CNN they are concerned that Chinese health officials have still not released basic epidemiological data about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, making it more difficult to contain.  WHO has played a number of roles in the international response to the outbreak, including coordinating with international authorities and researchers, as well as developing guidance for lab testing, treatment and prevention measures.
2020-01-23	(CNN) Advisers to the CDC say a lack of data from China about the Wuhan coronavirus is curtailing international efforts to quell the outbreak.  While the advisers commended the Chinese researchers for mapping the virus's genome in just a few weeks, they said there's a glaring lack of basic epidemiological evidence about who's getting infected with the virus and how it's spreading.  "This is Epi 101," said Dr. William Schaffner , medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a longtime CDC adviser. "I don't want to denigrate our Chinese colleagues, but when information is not presented clearly, you have to wonder."  The outbreak has grown quickly. The first cases were reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, and by January 3, there were 44 cases in China. Now, not even three weeks later, there are more then 600 cases, and the outbreak has spread to Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and the United States, where there is one case.  The CDC advisers said since there's no vaccine against this new virus, public health efforts, such as catching cases early and instituting quarantine rules, are crucial. But they say it's hard to know whom to quarantine and for how long without knowing how people are getting infected, at what point and for how long they're capable of spreading the virus to others.  "This information is critically important. It tells you how to control the outbreak and what to worry about and whom to worry about," said Dr. Paul Offit, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and a longtime CDC adviser.  At a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday, Li Bin, the vice minister of China's National Health Commission said his country is "committed to public disclosure of information as well as international exchanges and cooperation."  "We will disclose information on the outbreak in a timely, open and transparent manner, objectively reporting outbreak developments," Li said, adding that China will share information with the WHO and other countries "on outbreak monitoring, investigation and treatment as well as risk assessment opinions in a timely manner so that we can discuss and improve measures together."  Crucial questions left unanswered  On Thursday, Chinese authorities presented top officials from the World Health Organization with new epidemiological information that revealed an increase in the number of cases, suspected cases, affected provinces and the proportion of deaths that are occurring. They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan -- meaning one infected person can give the virus to a second person, who can give it to a third person, who can give it to a fourth person. They reported second-generation cases outside of Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province, according to a WHO media release.  But the CDC advisers said that's not nearly enough. They said there are very specific pieces of information about the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus that are still missing.  Among them: Of more than 600 cases, how many contracted the virus from handling animals at the market where the virus emerged and how many contracted it from people who had been at the market?  Among those who never went to the market, are they family members of the people who got infected at the market or colleagues who sit next to each other at work? Or maybe they don't know anyone who is sick and it's unclear where they caught it?  Looking at that chain of infection, are people spreading the disease before they have symptoms, while they have symptoms or after they've recovered?  Answers to those questions would help officials decide how long to isolate sick patients and who needs to be quarantined to see if they do develop symptoms.  "You've got to understand how this spreads," said Patricia Stinchfield , vice president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a CDC adviser. "And you want to know what people's symptoms are and who's having mild versus severe disease. How many people are hospitalized? How many in the intensive care unit?"  Stinchfield , a pediatric nurse practitioner and senior director of infection control at Children's Minnesota and Schaffner, an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are both liaison members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Offit was a voting member of that group from 1998-2003 and has been on CDC working groups since then.  JUST WATCHED What do you need to know about Coronavirus? Replay More Videos ...

A WHO official said he understands the frustration about a lack of epidemiological information, but that it's possible that some CDC staffers know the answers to some of these questions and just haven't shared them with the advisers or the general public.  Dr. David Heymann, chair of the WHO's Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards , said at the beginning of an outbreak, sometimes different groups know different pieces of information.  "The CDC might have access to info that WHO doesn't have, and vice versa," he said.  In general, the more information public health officials know, the better, Schaffner said.  "The more you know, the more comprehensive you can be in defining and controlling what the issue is," he said.
2020-01-23	Hong Kong (CNN) Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2003 SARS crisis , Zhong Nanshan, one of the heroes in China's fight against that disease, described it as a "turning point" for the nation.  "SARS forced the whole country to pay attention to the livelihood of the people," he said , before adding a warning. "We've made huge progress, but our footsteps are slow, especially in terms of healthcare."  With the Wuhan coronavirus spreading across the country , killing at least 25 people so far, China is now facing a major test of just how much it has changed since 2003, both in terms of the healthcare system's ability to react to a new deadly pathogen -- and crucially, how the central government handles the developing crisis.  Speaking this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered "all-out efforts" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected. His intervention seemed to carry with it a clear message: the mistakes of SARS will not be repeated.  Wuhan is only the latest crisis to face Xi since he secured personal control of the Communist Party, joining the US-China trade war, ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong, and the recent Taiwan election, in which Tsai Ing-wen, much loathed by Beijing, handily won reelection against a more pro-China candidate  More than any leader since Mao Zedong, Xi has centralized power around himself. He is the state, and while this gives him immense control, it also means that every crisis is a test of his leadership -- Wuhan perhaps most of all, as the country looks to their leader for reassurance and confidence.  Since Xi's statement, efforts to control the virus have ramped up nationwide, with health authorities ordering the highest level response, typically used to tackle outbreaks of plague or cholera. On Thursday, Wuhan itself -- all 11 million people -- was partially quarantined , with public transport "temporarily suspended," including all planes and trains departing the city.  Despite the laudatory efforts of Chinese healthcare workers, however, and forceful statements from Beijing, allegations of an initial -- and potentially even ongoing -- cover-up continue to hang over the Wuhan outbreak.  This virus could have been China's chance to exorcise the ghosts of SARS once and for all, instead it may have exposed that, for all the progress in the past 17 years, fundamental flaws remain in place when it comes to handling a crisis like this -- ones that could result in far greater danger in future.  Crisis and cover-up  The first cases of what would later be called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were identified in southern China in November 2002. The virus would go on to infect more than 8,000 people worldwide, the majority of them in China.  Even as the deadly pathogen spread throughout Guangdong province, however, media reports were censored and patients and their families prevented from speaking out. If they addressed the issue at all, officials downplayed it , unwilling to risk upsetting the economy or "social stability" -- important metrics for future promotion.  It was not until whisteblower Jiang Yanyong , a retired Chinese army doctor, came forward in early 2003 that much of China and the rest of the world became aware of the true danger -- by which time SARS had already spread widely. The virus was soon declared a "global threat" by the World Health Organization (WHO) and efforts to contain its spread were put in place worldwide.  In the months that followed, China's government officially apologized for its slow reporting of the outbreak, and the country's health minister was sacked , along with the mayor of Beijing at the time. "Never again" was the message of the day, one that has been repeated ad nauseum regarding the Wuhan virus.  While the Communist Party's grasp on power in China has grown stronger than ever under Xi, it's popular legitimacy is much more fragile. The SARS scandal, and similarly mishandled crises such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake , had a devastating effect on that legitimacy, greatly alarming officials who place "stability" above all else.  Xi's gathering of power around himself also means the Wuhan crisis will be more of a test of his personal control of the Party and country -- and of the highly-centralized system he's put in place in recent years.  Initial problems  By a number of measures, China's handling of the current crisis has been infinitely better than during SARS. Authorities in Wuhan alerted the public to the new virus in mid-December, soon after the first cases were identified. Xi's statement four weeks later drastically boosted the response and publicized the risk.  In 2003, by comparison, it was over two months after the first patients were diagnosed with SARS that the WHO was alerted -- by a whistleblower, not the Chinese authorities -- of a "strange contagious disease" that has "already left more than 100 people dead."  But behind this outwardly competent handling of a crisis there are signs of a deeper problem.  One of the oldest cliches in Chinese politics is that "the mountains are high and the emperor is far away." Despite being an intensely centralized state, provincial authorities do not always act as Beijing would prefer, nor do commandments from on high -- to crack down on corruption or reign in pollution, or to increase transparency -- always trickle down to the provinces.  While unconfirmed, there are numerous indications that officials in Wuhan downplayed the risks of the virus for several weeks, delaying proper action and potentially increasing its spread.  it was not until January 14 that officials in Wuhan introduced any screening measures. In the intervening period, a major meeting of the Hubei provincial party was held in the city, and more than 40,000 families were invited to attend Though the first case was detected on December 8 --it was not until January 14 that officials in Wuhan introduced any screening measures. In the intervening period, a major meeting of the Hubei provincial party was held in the city, and more than 40,000 families were invited to attend a banquet in an attempt to set a world record.  Speaking to state media, Wuhan officials downplayed the danger, saying the virus was unlikely to be spread from human to human. State officials initially repeated this assessment: Wang Guangfa, head of a team of researchers sent from Beijing to investigate the situation, said on January 11 that it was under control -- he has since been diagnosed with the virus  At the same time, Wuhan authorities also tried to clamp down on discussion of the virus. State media reported that police arrested eight people in early January for spreading "rumors" that the virus was related to SARS, something which has since been confirmed by health authorities.  Even as researchers in the UK estimated that the initial spread of the virus could have affected at least 1,700 people, no new cases were reported in Wuhan itself, despite patients being identified in other countries. "Does the virus only affect overseas travelers?" people asked darkly on Chinese social media, where accusations of a cover-up quickly spread and were censored.  It was not until inspectors sent from Beijing had assessed the situation that the alarm was properly raised. In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Zhong Nanshan, the SARS hero, said there was " definitely human-to-human transmission ," and warned the infection rate was "climbing."  Passengers who arrived on one of the last flights from the Chinese city of Wuhan walk through a health screening station at Narita airport in Chiba prefecture, outside Tokyo, on January 23, 2020.  Worst possible timing  Speaking to state media this week, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that the city's "warnings were not sufficient."  Whether because of bureaucratic incompetence or a politically-motivated cover-up, the delay could not have come at a worse time. China is currently in the middle of the Lunar New Year travel rush , in which hundreds of millions of people move across the country, packed close together on trains, coaches and planes.  Revelations about the true spread and severity of the virus only came after the four-week travel period had got underway, and restrictions on people leaving Wuhan itself did not come into place until Thursday. One woman identified as having the virus in South Korea even told health officials there that she visited a doctor in Wuhan with symptoms -- after screening measures were introduced -- but got sent on her way and was able to leave the country.  The pervasive censorship of the Chinese press and internet undoubtedly played a role in this, as did Xi's years-long crackdown on civil society groups, forcing people to rely on official accounts and the transparency of officials whose own motivations are often completely apposite.  Once Xi intervened, essentially signaling that the Wuhan virus was fair game for Chinese media, reporters rushed to the scene. Both Caixin and the Beijing News -- some of the most independently minded outlets in the country -- quickly began producing in-depth coverage , some of which exposed oversights by local officials and punched holes in their narrative. Writing on WeChat from Wuhan, Caixin reporter Gao Yu compared the situation to SARS, saying that "the lack of transparency, public supervision and truth (have) caused huge damage to public safety."  China learned hard lessons in 2003 at a terrible cost. The legacy of SARS could be seen in the central government's response this month, and that of Chinese scientists, both of which deserve a great deal of credit.  But Xi has also reversed gradual liberalization and opening up which occurred post-SARS, massively centralizing power within the Communist Party once again. At the same time, he has overseen a crackdown on the internet, the press and civil society, and an anti-corruption purge that, while it has turfed out plenty of bad apples, may also have left provincial officials more afraid of angering Beijing.  Xi is the closest China has had to an emperor since Mao, but like the old saying goes, he's often far away. The Wuhan virus shows what happens when the country has to rely on information filtering up to the top for decisive action to be taken.
2020-01-24	The University of Chester campus in November 2018. Shutterstock  Chinese students have been warned by a British university that they risk being quarantined on their return to the UK, if they travel home to celebrate the Lunar New Year.  The quarantine advice from the University of Chester was issued before travel restrictions were imposed by Chinese authorities.  The University of Chester has a relatively small Chinese student cohort and they are being appropriately supported. All students have been advised they must not interrupt their studies to return to China at this point."  British universities are "monitoring the coronavirus situation as it unfolds and universities with students in affected areas are working to identify appropriate actions," according to Universities UK.  It added that universities will continue to follow travel advice by the UK Foreign Office "and to monitor the situation, which is evolving rapidly.”  Chinese nationals make up the biggest proportion of international students for higher education institutions in the UK, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).  In the 2017-18 academic year, there were a total of 106,530 Chinese nationals studying in the UK.
2020-01-24	Paris, France (CNN) Three cases of Wuhan coronavirus have been identified in France, the Health Ministry announced Friday. They are the first European cases of the newly discovered virus, officials said.  One patient is a 48-year-old man in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, Health Minister Agnès Buzyn told reporters.  Buzyn said the man traveled to China and visited Wuhan before returning to France on January 22. A day later, he sought medical examination and has remained in isolation since then.  "He's in isolation and he's doing well," Buzyn said.  Two other patients have been admitted to a hospital in Paris, the ministry said in a statement.  Read More
2020-01-24	Hong Kong (CNN) Fifteen more people have been confirmed dead in Hubei province from a deadly new coronavirus , according to the provincial health authority, raising the death toll to 41 in mainland China.  Authorities in China have imposed indefinite travel restrictions on tens of millions of people across 11 cities in an unprecedented effort to contain the spread, as hospitals at the epicenter of the outbreak struggle to handle a surge in new patients.  The virus, which was first discovered in the city of Wuhan in December, has spread to every province in China, except the remote autonomous regions of Qinghai and Tibet.  Another 180 cases of the virus were confirmed in Hubei, said the provincial health authority. This raises the total number of confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases to more than 1,200 in mainland China.  The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which began Friday, has led to concerns that the outbreak could quickly accelerate, as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit friends and relatives.  Wuhan, the largest and most populous city in central China, was placed under lockdown Thursday, while public transport has been suspended in 10 neighboring cities. Numerous other measures and restrictions on public gatherings have also been implemented in the region. More than 30 million people could be affected.  Posts on social media show an atmosphere of fear and anxiety among those inside Wuhan, amid rising uncertainty over the ability of authorities to handle the potential epidemic.  People spoke of sick family members turned away from hospitals due to a lack of beds, or wards packed with feverish patients and limited screening or quarantine.  Video from Chinese social media appears to show hospitals in the city totally overwhelmed. In one video, a hospital corridor appears to be flooded with patients waiting for test results. In another, medical workers tend patient wearing full protective suits. CNN has not been able to independently verify the videos.  The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission acknowledged in a statement that there were a shortage of beds and long outpatient queues in the city. In response, it said seven hospitals will now be used solely for fever patients and more than 3,000 beds will be made available for suspected and confirmed cases of the virus.  Speaking to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, medical workers in Wuhan have described an incredibly intense environment, where they must balance dealing with the overload of patients and suspected patients while also keeping themselves safe.  Residents wear masks to buy vegetables in a market in Wuhan.  "Today, I heard one of my colleagues say that she has got blisters on her face," Wang Jun, a nurse at Jinyintan Hospital, told the broadcaster. "It happened because she had to keep the face mask on tight for a long time."  On Friday, Chinese authorities announced they would construct a 1,000-bed dedicated pneumonia hospital in the city within six days to help treat the hundreds of people affected by the virus. According to state-backed newspaper Beijing News , the hospital will be a prefabricated, box-type model that can be built in the short time frame.  A similar hospital was built during the SARS epidemic in 2003 in Beijing. According to the paper, the dedicated SARS hospital treated almost 700 patients, and had a mortality rate of 1.18%, far below the national average.  In the meantime, hospitals have asked for donations of medical supplies, including masks, medical gloves and protective suits.  On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) moved to declare the new coronavirus an emergency within China but has refrained from classifying the outbreak as an epidemic of international concern.  Mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland China, however, with various countries and territories reporting their first cases, including the United States and Europe.  Health officials in France confirmed two cases of coronavirus on Friday. French Health Minister Agnès Buzyn told reporters one patient is in Paris and another one in Bordeaux.  Cases of the virus have been confirmed in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam.  Three people were tested for suspected coronavirus in Scotland, "as a precautionary measure only" after traveling from Wuhan, a government spokesperson said. Cases are also under investigation in Canada and Australia, health officials said.  Third generation spread  On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a WHO committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. "We are now seeing second and third generation spread," Heymann said.  Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species.  Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market spreads the virus to someone else, who then spreads it to a third person. The announcement marks a development in the progress of the spread of the virus.  It initially appeared to spread only by very close contact that would typically occur within a family -- such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating utensils -- but now evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus, such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else's face.  Heymann said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles.  On Friday, an 80-year-old man died of the Wuhan coronavirus in Hebei province, near Beijing -- the first death outside of the outbreak's epicenter, according to the provincial health authority.  The man had visited Wuhan and stayed with relatives for over two months, health authorities said.  In a press conference on Thursday, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that of those infected, a quarter of patients have experienced severe disease, Ghebreyesus added.  He acknowledged that there is "still a lot we don't know" about how -- and how quickly -- the virus spreads.  "We don't know the source of this virus, we don't understand how easily it spreads and we don't fully understand its clinical features or severity."  As officials race to slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, containment efforts are being put in place.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) raised its travel notice to the highest level "warning" for Wuhan from level 2 to level 3, which recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to the city.  CDC advisors are concerned about the lack of data coming out of Wuhan and worry that Chinese health officials still have not released basic epidemiological data more than three weeks into the outbreak.  Lunar New Year celebrations canceled  Chinese passengers, most wearing masks, arrive to board trains before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.  Saturday marks the first day of the Lunar New Year, as countries across Asia greet the Year of the Rat.  But celebrations will be considerably smaller in China than in previous years, as authorities move to cancel many large public gatherings in order to help contain the Wuhan coronavirus.  In Beijing, officials have canceled all large-scale New Year celebrations "in order to control the epidemic," including the city's traditional temple fairs. In Shanghai, the popular Disneyland theme park announced it would close from Saturday until further notice.  Celebrations have also been canceled in Hong Kong, and many other cities have issued guidance to citizens to avoid large public gatherings.  On Friday, China's two most important cities launched a Level 1 emergency response -- the highest level for a public health emergency -- to combat the outbreak, according to state broadcaster CGTN.  A total of 29 cases of the virus were confirmed in Beijing, according to CGTN, with more than 20 cases confirmed in Shanghai.  Hubei, the province at the center of the virus outbreak, declared a Level 1 response earlier Friday.
2020-01-24	Laurie Garrett is a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and policy analyst, and the author of "The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance." The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN.  (CNN) On this date 17 years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37 countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them.  So, as I read the first reports of a cluster of animal-market related illnesses, with the first patient exhibiting symptoms of pneumonia as early as December 12, 2019 , I had a chilling sense of déjà vu. By New Year's Eve, it was obvious something akin to SARS -- as it turns out, the Wuhan coronavirus is in the same family of viruses as SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) -- was unfolding in China.  The mysterious pneumonia virus that emerged from a live animal market in China's central city of Wuhan last month has now infected far too many people, over far too vast a geographic area, to be easily controlled.  The first American case -- involving a man in his 30s who recently traveled to Wuhan -- was confirmed outside Seattle on January 21, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday a second case in Chicago. As of Friday, at least 41 people have died from the illness.  I warned that China appeared to be taking more aggressive steps shutting down social media posts, arresting people accused of spreading "rumors" and capping the flow of information about the outbreak than it was halting the transmission of the virus. For more than a week, the reported number of cases barely changed after local authorities shut down the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market , the putative source of the virus. And authorities insisted the cause was neither SARS, nor similar viruses like the flu, avian flu, or MERS.  They also repeatedly stated that there was no evidence of human-to-human spread of the disease (which turned out to be false), leading the World Health Organization and outside world to believe that closing the live animal market effectively brought the outbreak to a halt.  As recently as January 18, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention posted stern warnings against paying heed to "rumors" and insisted there were no cases of the disease in hospitals outside of Wuhan, adding that the outbreak was "preventable and controllable."  But we now know that was far from true.  Officially, there are more than 1,000 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus. Unofficially, however, the toll is likely to be far higher, and more than 20 Chinese cities have reported cases of the coronavirus.  Separate studies from London's Imperial College and Hong Kong University Medical School estimated that some 1,300 to 1,700 people were infected during the first week of January, when Chinese officials reported just a handful of cases and downplayed the epidemic's severity. This week, the Imperial College team estimated that there were a total of 4,000 cases (with the possibility of up to 9,700 cases in the worst-case scenario) by January 18, when the official tally was still at 62 cases  Using a different statistical method, scientists at Northeastern University in Boston reckon that 5,900 were infected by January 23.  Despite the wide disparity in the figures, this new epidemic seems poised to eclipse the scale of the 2003 SARS epidemic, and is already well outside of the reach of simple control measures.  Hong Kong University virologist Guan Yi, who was part of the team that discovered the SARS virus, tells the Washington Post that the epidemic is so out of control now that "a bigger outbreak is certain." He said that even with a conservative estimate, the outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic -- with a reach of more than 80,000 cases.  Speaking on background, other SARS veterans tell me there may already be "many thousands" of infected individuals in China.  Because authorities initially downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak instead of implementing swift control measures, people have traveled to and from Wuhan -- a major transportation hub with a population of 11 million people -- and unwittingly carried the virus with them.  Chinese authorities have shut down flights, ferries, highways, and trains leaving Wuhan, as well as public transportation within the city. Twelve other cities in China have issued travel restrictions in an unprecedented move to contain the virus just days before the Lunar New Year on January 25, which usually ushers the largest human migration on earth, with hundreds of millions of people traveling to see relatives.  Following my January 8 claim that the Chinese government was covering up a significant epidemic, pressure mounted from United Nations agencies, Ministries of Health worldwide and the scientific community. Finally, Wuhan provincial communist party chief Jiang Chaoliang, and his counterparts in neighboring districts, came under veiled criticism from President Xi Jinping who ordered Party leaders to "put people's safety and health as the top priority and take effective measures to curb the spread of the virus."  On January 20, China's National Health Commission designated the new disease a Class B infection, although it was treating the virus as a Class A infection -- meaning mandatory quarantines and community lockdowns may be used to stop its spread.  And the following day, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted on social media that, "Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people." The commentary also warned that "anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity" and stressed that transparency was the best defense against rumors and widespread fear.  Not surprisingly, reported numbers of cases from all over China jumped dramatically after Xi's speech and subsequent pressure from Beijing. This has confused matters considerably, making it impossible to tell how much of the soaring epidemic toll is due to a surge in actual new infections, versus release of case numbers that local authorities had been covering up.  Worse, despite calls for openness, SARS hero Dr. Zhong Nanshan , who was celebrated for his 2003 efforts, gave a televised interview on January 20 in which he warned that 14 healthcare workers were infected in Wuhan, the risk to medical personnel is acute, and severity of threat will rise if the virus mutates. Zhong, who had initially made several appearances on Chinese television, has not been featured on broadcasts in recent days, with some speculating that the government is now silencing him  But Zhong's warning represented sound science. As the leading Chinese virology team wrote, after comparing the genetics and proteins of the new virus and SARS, "the Wuhan nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission," because it -- like SARS -- has the ability to bind to a protein found on the surface of most human lung cells. "People also need to be reminded that risk and dynamic of cross-species or human-to-human transmission of coronaviruses are also affected by many other factors," like the host's immune response, the speed with which the viruses can multiply inside human lungs, and the potential mutations that might make the virus more virulent or transmissible.  In 2003, a fresh food market continues to trade despite the threat of the SARS virus in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, China.  Regardless of how transparent Beijing may now become, what I witnessed tracking SARS across Hong Kong and China, and subsequent investigations of sites hit by the disease in Hanoi, Bangkok, Singapore, Toronto and Hong Kong augurs poorly for this new viral epidemic and China's ability to bring it to a rapid resolution.  While 17 years has brought significant improvements in virology, diagnostics development, international health regulations and the WHO, and we know more today about the nCoV2019 virus (as the Wuhan coronavirus is awkwardly dubbed) than we did one month into the SARS epidemic, there is no magic wand that can wave this highly dispersed, airborne-spread, human-to-human transmitting microbe away.  After the initial coverup, Beijing is now executing the playbook that ultimately stopped SARS. The city of Wuhan is now on lockdown and fever checkpoints are operating in most major transit hubs across the country while Lunar New Year celebrations have been canceled. Instant contagious quarantine 1,000-bed facilities are under construction, with one due to open next week outside Wuhan. One key step -- closing all live animal markets nationwide -- has not yet been implemented.  I discovered in 2003 that wildlife dealers and animal breeders sell their living creatures all over the country, so that an infected animal in one city's market may well have a counterpart from the same dealer, on sale in another market hundreds of miles away. It is not yet known what beast was the source of nCoV2019, though one study suggests, based on genetic analysis of the virus, that it came from a snake . The SARS virus was transmitted to restaurant workers who bought and slaughtered live civets -- raccoon-like animals in a Guangzhou live animal market, which I investigated before authorities shut it down.  Like the Guangzhou market, Wuhan's Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market sells a vast range of animals , including civets as well as other exotic wild animals. All live animal markets throughout China and neighboring Asian countries should be shut down immediately, and not reopen until the source of the nCoV2019 epidemic is identified. Until then, it should be assumed that any live animals sold in markets from Hanoi, Vietnam, to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, might be dangerous to hold, slaughter or consume.  To stop the SARS epidemic in 2003, governments, hospitals and public health authorities resorted to measures that mirrored infection control in the early 20th century, focusing on taking temperatures to find individuals with fevers, and then placing those people -- regardless of the causes of their febrile states -- in mandatory quarantine. Eventually, with the feverish souls separated from the rest of humanity, the virus stopped spreading. By June 2003 the Chinese government was able to declare victory over SARS, eight months after the virus first emerged.  This photo taken on January 22, 2020 shows medical staff members wearing protective suits at the Zhongnan hospital in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province.  Here is what it will take, then, to stop the Wuhan virus.  First, the flow of people who are infected has to stop and transportation across the entirety of China must be monitored or restricted. The Wuhan animal market from which nCoV2019 arose is located less than 0.5 miles from one of the city's train stations, where several high-speed rails stop. It must be assumed that people, and their live animals, walked that short distance earlier this month to take the trains -- possibly carrying the virus with them to cities across China.  A post from Wuhan Railway that has since been deleted said 300,000 people traveled out of Wuhan by train on Wednesday. It is imperative that the tough lockdown measures unfolding this week presage nationwide travel restrictions.  During the SARS epidemic, a brave military physician leaked medical documents to Time magazine , providing proof that SARS patients were secretly being treated in People's Liberation Army facilities in Beijing. Once word was out, I watched as tens of thousands of Beijing residents climbed onto trains, fleeing the city -- and taking SARS to every corner of the country.  After the exodus from Beijing in 2003, authorities erected fever check stations in every air, bus and train terminal in China, and placed policed health stations along the nation's highways. Fever-check stations were so abundant that I was typically tested 10 to 12 times a day in Beijing, and every 10 to 20 miles while driving on major highways.  The Chinese government has started erecting a network of fever stations in transit hubs , and I expect this will ramp up considerably over the coming week. Social media posts already show several photos and videos of officials erecting roadblocks, barricades, and traffic diversions to police-manned fever stations and similar measures reminiscent of what I witnessed in 2003.  Currently, family members of known nCoV2019 patients are tested for infection and placed under surveillance. Chinese authorities are already tracking hundreds of close contacts of known patients, and this will escalate radically over coming days. Apartment complexes and hotels that are known to have housed a nCoV2019-infected person will also be scoured.  Medical staff wearing protective gear go about their duties in the Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po where seven hospital workers have gone down with flu-like symptoms on August 27, 2003.  There must also be a safe place to quarantine people who are running temperatures. In 2003 I watched in frank astonishment as teams of Chinese workers erected entire hospitals -- complete with air filters, special sewage systems and electricity -- in just days, province-by-province. A similar effort is now underway in Wuhan  By far the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. Both MERS and SARS spread like wildfire through unprepared medical facilities, regardless of the comparative wealth and sophistication of the hospitals. Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: one had just a single healthcare worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments.  The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training, which taught staff to work in teams and make sure that any contaminated protective gear was safely removed without contact with the skin, face, eyes or hands.  Over the last few days, many Chinese social media users have posted dramatic videos and photos of over-crowded hospital emergency room facilities, in which frantic patients and family members are crammed together and healthcare workers are hard-pressed to control the influx, as the infectious spread of the virus is surely occurring. In the SARS epidemic, hospitals eventually realized the need to set up fever check stations outside the facilities, screening would-be patients, and ushering febrile individuals into an entry separate from other hospital admissions.  In Toronto and Singapore, which have remarkably good healthcare systems and state-of-the-art facilities, hospital workers struggled mightily to stop spread of SARS, and healthcare workers who were infected died. In some of my discussions with physicians and nurses that went through the SARS nightmares, I have learned that the wealthier facilities were, perhaps, at greater risk because they had more equipment and procedures to apply to patients, including intubation and lavage, which was used to remove fluids from the lungs that built up in response to infection.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  When SARS hit Hanoi, patients were originally taken to the prestigious French Hospital, where modern interventions were used, but the virus readily spread, taking the lives of doctors and nurses. When patients were moved to the far less sophisticated Bach Mai Hospital, which lacked some of the more advanced equipment, windows were open due to a lack of air conditioning.  According to some of the doctors, this slowed the spread of the virus by preventing it from adhering to surfaces and people in the hospital.  China is likely to take a serious economic hit as a result of the nCoV2019 virus. The SARS epidemic cost the global economy $54 billion, according to a World Bank estimate, and the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to affect Chinese tourism and trade. Seventeen years after SARS, China -- now the second largest economy in the world -- is likely to experience a higher scale of costs and burdens to execute nationwide containment strategy. But Beijing has no choice. The virus is already everywhere.
2020-01-25	NYEIN CHAN NAING/POOL/AFP via Getty Images  Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired a meeting with top officials of the ruling Communist Party on the prevention and control of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, China’s state media reported Saturday.  During the meeting, Xi pointed out that in facing the grave situation of the rapid spreading epidemic of the deadly new coronavirus, it is necessary to strengthen the centralized leadership of the Party Central Committee.  He also said that he has been paying very close attention to the virus outbreak and demanded that the government at all levels to put people’s life and health as the top priority.  "Life is of paramount importance. When an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it," Xi said, stressing the importance and urgency of the work.  What else is being done to address the outbreak: Xi ordered officials in the Hubei Province to take more rigorous measures to prevent the virus from spreading and to put all patients in centralized quarantine for treatment. He urged the party committees and governments at various levels to fully implement the decisions and policies made by the Party’s Central Committee, make all-out efforts and mobilize all the available resources to curb the spread of the virus.  He called for strengthening the protection of medical staff, ensuring the market supply of materials in need, intensifying disclosure of related information to guide the public opinion as well as the mobilization of social forces to uphold the overall stability of society.  Xi and other leaders also made new arrangements for further studies on the treatment of patients already infected with the virus.
2020-01-25	(CNN) The US government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens from the Chinese city that has become ground zero for a new deadly strain of coronavirus, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN Saturday.  The United States has a contract with a transporter to evacuate about three dozen diplomats and their families from the US consulate in Wuhan, China. The consulate is closed and all US diplomats are "under ordered departure," the official said.  Details of the flight plan are still being finalized -- for example, officials were still deciding between a narrow-body Boeing 737 and a wide-body Boeing 767 -- and the source said "a lot depends on what the Chinese authorities will allow us to do," adding that Beijing has been "very cooperative." The Wall Street Journal first reported the planned evacuation.  The State Department and White House have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment on the matter.  The US consulate in Wuhan reached out to Americans registered with the consulate and offered them seats on a flight, the official told CNN. The flight will have medical personnel aboard to treat anyone with the virus and make sure it is contained.  Read More
2020-01-25	Beijing (CNN) The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus in China continues rising as authorities and health care workers struggle to contain the outbreak .  Fifty-six people have been killed by the novel coronavirus in China, health officials said on Saturday. Over 1,900 confirmed cases have been reported across the country.  China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that 237 patients are in critical condition.  Healthcare workers in the Chinese city of Wuhan say hospitals are running low on supplies as they treat an increasing number of patients.  The Chinese central government announced it would send more than 1,200 health workers — as well as 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- to the cityin an unprecedented effort to contain the spread of the virus.  Lunar New Year celebrations -- the country's most important holiday -- have been greatly impacted in Beijing, Hong Kong and other major cities due to the virus. More than 60 million people are under partial lockdown in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong.  While most confirmed cases of the virus are in China, at least 13 places outside mainland China, including France, Australia and the United States are reporting their first cases.  In Canada, health officials on Saturday announced the first "presumptive" positive case of coronavirus. The case is pending additional confirmation from the country's national medical laboratory.  In Wuhan, ground zero for the virus, four healthcare workers -- including doctors -- have told CNN of the difficulties facing medical crews on the ground. They have asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions.  Through telephone conversations with CNN and posts on Chinese social media, they told of low hospital resources. In private groups online, those identified as hospital staff are coordinating with members of the public to import protective equipment as they treat an increasing number of infected patients.  "In terms of resources, the whole of Wuhan is lacking," one Wuhan-based healthcare worker told CNN by phone. This person said they were looking for more protective clothing, protective goggles and masks.  "It's really like we're going into battle stripped to the waist," one healthcare worker added, using a Chinese idiom that equates to "going into battle without armor".  One hospital staff member claims healthcare workers have resorted to wearing diapers to work so as to avoid having to remove their HAZMAT suits, which they say are in short supply. A doctor on her Chinese social media Weibo page described similar accounts at another Wuhan hospital.  "My family members are definitely worried about me, but I still have to work," another doctor told. But she said that she is hopeful they will ultimately get the gear they need. "Our bosses, our hospital suppliers will definitely find a way to get these stocks to us," she added.  It's not clear if these accounts are anecdotal or whether there are widespread shortages across Wuhan.  Chinese state media has also shared posts from multiple Wuhan hospitals in which they ask for public donations of medical supplies. They report that one hospital staff member said the current supplies "are only able to sustain three or four days".  The Wuhan Health Commission has requisitioned over 10,000 beds from 24 hospitals to be used in the treatment of confirmed and suspected cases.  On Friday, Wuhan officials acknowledged that local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention and said measures were being put into place to alleviate the situation.  State media also reported that the city aims to build a 25,000 square meter (269,100 square foot) new facility within a week, increasing hospital capacity by 1,000 beds, and that several medical centers in Hubei province are asking for medical gear donations.  Locking down the virus over Lunar New Year  Authorities have imposed indefinite restrictions on public transport and travel.  All motor vehicles will be banned in Wuhan's city center starting Sunday to control the flow of people, according to the Wuhan Command Center, the taskforce set up to combat the virus. Only vehicles with special permits, free shuttles and government vehicles will be allowed to circulate.  Amid the lockdown, countries like the US and France have been attempting to evacuate their citizens from the central Chinese city.  The US government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens from Wuhan, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN.  The French government says it's planning to set up a bus service to move French nationals out of Wuhan.  Meanwhile, 56 Indian students have been trapped in Wuhan for three days, with some afraid to leave their dorm room and fearful of running out of food.  Ganesan Deepshikha, a student at the Wuhan University School Of Medicine, told CNN that the students have been told by the Indian Embassy that they are safe in Wuhan but have not received any assistance.  The virus, which was first discovered in Wuhan in December, has spread to every province in China, except the remote autonomous region of Tibet.  Among those infected is a 2-year-old girl in the southern region of Guangxi, the local health authority said. She is believed to be the youngest patient infected.  The week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began Saturday, has led to concerns that the outbreak could quickly accelerate, as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit friends and relatives.  Lunar New Year is to China what the Christmas-New Year holiday period is to the United States -- except China's 1.4 billion population is more than four times that of the US.  In many cities, festivities have been called off. Authorities in Beijing have canceled all large-scale Lunar New Year celebrations, including traditional fairs and celebrations around temples.  Shanghai Disneyland has temporarily closed its doors. Seven blockbuster movies that were set to hit theaters this weekend have been canceled or postponed.  Businesses are also taking measures to protect staff and the public.  On Saturday, coffee giant Starbucks said it has closed all 90 of its Hubei stores indefinitely. The closures will continue throughout the Spring Festival, which runs until the end of January.  "All Starbucks stores and special star delivery in Hubei will be temporarily closed. Hubei employees are asked to rest at home, minimize going out, take care to protect themselves and their families. All store employees who were scheduled to work during the closing period will be paid as usual," a statement from the company said.  A global concern  JUST WATCHED What do you need to know about Coronavirus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What do you need to know about Coronavirus? 02:29  On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) moved to declare the coronavirus an emergency within China -- but refrained from classifying the outbreak as an epidemic of international concern.  Mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland China, however, with 13 countries and territories reporting confirmed cases, including the United States and France.  Australia confirmed that three men who traveled from China to Sydney had tested positive, health authorities in the city said. The country has now confirmed a total of four cases.  Nepal also confirmed its first case, a spokesman for the country's Health Ministry told CNN. The patient is a 31-year-old Nepali man studying for his PhD in Wuhan, spokesman Mahendra Kumar Shrestha said. The student flew to Nepal earlier this month and was admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu on January 13 with fever and respiratory problems.  In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control has announced a third confirmed case of the virus. A 54-year-old South Korean man who lives in Wuhan and traveled to South Korea on January 20 called a hotline on Saturday to report his symptoms, the agency said.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that the Hong Kong Disease contingency plan has been upgraded from "serious" to "emergency" level. Schools in the Chinese territory will be suspended until February 17.  On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a WHO committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. "We are now seeing second and third generation spread," Heymann said.  Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species.  Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market spreads the virus to someone else, who then spreads it to a third person. The announcement marks a development in the progress of the spread of the virus.  Heymann said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles.
2020-01-26	Hong Kong (CNN) The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus now stands at 80, with almost 2,800 cases confirmed across China, as the country initiates emergency procedures to try and rein in the pathogen's global spread.  Making that task more difficult is the fact that the virus can be spread before any symptoms appear , Chinese health authorities said Sunday, meaning carriers may not realize they are infected before they transmit the virus to others.  Across China, 15 cities with a combined population of over 57 million people -- more than the entire population of South Korea -- have been placed under full or partial lockdown.  Wuhan itself has been effectively quarantined, with all routes in and out of the city closed or highly regulated. The government announced it is sending an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- to help the city's stretched hospital staff.  Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said on Sunday that the number of cases could rise by another thousand.  The disease has also spread widely across China, with almost 70 cases confirmed in the capital Beijing, including a nine-month-old girl -- the youngest known case to be confirmed so far.  China has extended the Lunar New Year holiday to February 2 in an attempt to dissuade people from traveling and spreading the virus further. Almost all mass celebrations for the festival have been canceled, and authorities have urged people to avoid holding traditional large family gatherings.  Shanghai's government said Monday that all businesses in the city should remain shut until February 9. Schools in the city have been suspended until February 17, and quarantine inspections for workers returning to the city have been strengthened.  Only businesses the government deems vital to the operation of China's biggest city -- such as gas stations, pharmacies and supermarkets -- will be allowed to remain open, the municipal government said.  The severity of the emerging crisis is evident in the government's response . The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party -- the country's top political body, headed by President Xi Jinping -- has taken direct control of operations. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Wuhan Monday to tour local hospitals, according to state media.  China's Ministry of Finance and National Health Commission has allotted 60.33 billion yuan (US$8.7 billion) towards fighting the deadly coronavirus this year, the ministry said on Monday.  Meanwhile, Zhou has admitted that the government didn't disclose information on the coronavirus in a "timely fashion."  In a live interview with state-run CCTV, Zhou said he took responsibility for the decision to lock down the city at the center of the outbreak -- a move he called "unprecedented in human history."  He said he knew that people were "not satisfied" with the rate at which his government had released information on the coronavirus.  "If anyone is asked to take the responsibility or people are complaining, as long as the epidemic can be controlled, we are willing to resign to take on the responsibility [of locking down the city]," he said on Monday.  Worldwide effort  The virus has spread quickly around the world since it was first discovered in Wuhan last month. In a paper published Sunday, scientists at Imperial College London estimated that each person infected has gone on to spread the virus to two or three others.  "This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak," they added.  At a press conference on Monday, Professor Gabriel Leung of the University of Hong Kong warned that "self-sustaining epidemics" could be expected in major cities across China, now that the virus has spread there. Major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, all of which have reported cases, could export infections to different places around the world.  "We hope that with intervention in other cities in China, the situation will be more positive," he said. "(However), containment measures may not always be effective, and will certainly be ineffective at some point in the long term."  Outside mainland China, at least 13 other places have reported cases of the virus, including France, Australia, Canada and the United States. Australia reported its fifth confirmed case Monday.  Switzerland's Federal Office for Public Health confirmed on Monday that authorities are testing for several suspected coronavirus cases at one hospital in the country.  In Hong Kong, authorities said residents of Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, and people who have visited the region in the last 14 days, will not be able to enter the city. The order does not cover Hong Kong residents, though they may be placed under quarantine.  There were protests in the northern Hong Kong town of Fanling -- near the Chinese border -- after it was announced that an unoccupied apartment building there would be converted to a "temporary" quarantine center. Residents set up roadblocks and clashed with police, and on Sunday the authorities said they were abandoning the plan.  Memories of the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak run deep in Hong Kong, and paranoia is already starting to settle in, with a rush purchases of face masks leading to shortages which may not be relieved until February, due to the Lunar New Year holiday and demand from China.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced over the weekend that the threat level from the virus has been raised from "serious" to "emergency." Schools in the semi-autonomous Chinese city will be suspended until February 17.  On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a World Health Organization (WHO) committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. "We are now seeing second and third generation spread," Heymann said.  In the US, where five cases of the disease have been confirmed, Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that "we need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I continue to hope that it is not."  Repatriation efforts to begin  Several countries, including the US, Australia, France and Spain are looking to repatriate citizens and government employees from China.  Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt told national broadcaster ABC Radio Monday that Canberra was working on a plan to bring 100 "young Australians" out of Wuhan.  JUST WATCHED CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China 02:45  "We are working to make sure that there's support for those Australians and that we are there. We are also working on, as are other countries, to try to secure their ability to return to Australia," Hunt said.  France's Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on Sunday that France will fly its citizens back from Wuhan to France "in the middle of next week." Buzyn said those who return to France will be monitored in one place for 14 days, to avoid any spread of the virus.  A spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry told CNN that it was "working with other European countries affected to organize a joint repatriation flight."  Italian, UK and Dutch authorities all said on Monday that they were considering evacuation or repatriation efforts to remove their citizens from the affected area.  Tracing the virus  Since the Wuhan virus was first identified in December, Chinese and international scientists have been studying it intensely, tracking its origin and working on a vaccine to fight it.  Officials from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday that they had successfully isolated the virus in environmental samples taken from a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan believed to be the source of the outbreak.  Thirty-three of the 585 environmental samples collected from the Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were found to contain the nucleic acid of the coronavirus, according to state-run news agency Xinhua  Of those samples, 31 came from the section of the market dedicated to the sale of wild animals, the CDC said.  Chinese authorities announced Sunday that the trading of wild animals would be suspended nationwide, as experts lobbied for the government to put in permanent restrictions or even a ban.  Any form of wildlife trade will be strictly prohibited on platforms including marketplaces, supermarkets, dining places and e-commerce sites, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration said in a statement. All sites were wild animals are raised will be quarantined.  Considerable attention has been paid on both the Chinese internet and in the western tabloid press to the eating of wild animals in parts of China -- particularly bats and civet cats, a mammal native to Asia that was previously linked to the 2003 SARS outbreak.
2020-01-26	The confirmed coronavirus patient in Orange County, California, is in isolation at an area hospital in good condition, Dr. Nichole Quick, health officer for the Orange County Health Care Agency, told CNN on Sunday. The patient, a man in his 50s, recently returned from Wuhan through Los Angeles International Airport, though Quick would not confirm whether he returned before or after airport screenings began on January 17.  According to Quick, the county was first alerted to the case on Thursday, January 23. The patient was exhibiting symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. His test specimens were collected with the help of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which confirmed the results as positive for coronavirus on Saturday. Upon learning of the positive results, the Orange County Health Care Agency worked with local providers to transport and admit the man to a local hospital.  The man is one of two confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus in California – the other being in Los Angeles County. The CDC on Sunday updated the national number of cases to five on Sunday afternoon.
2020-01-27	Hong Kong (CNN) As the world watches the developing crisis around the deadly Wuhan coronavirus , it's difficult to know how worried to be. One thing is clear, however: China is treating the matter extremely seriously.  With the number of confirmed cases in the country approaching three thousand, and at least 80 deaths, China has placed almost 60 million people on lockdown, with full or partial travel restrictions on 15 cities across Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital.  Thirty provinces and major cities have activated their highest level of emergency response, with checkpoints erected on roads and screening of travelers at airports and train stations. The semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong has initiated a complete ban on anyone from Hubei, or non-residents traveling from the province, arriving in the city.  In Beijing, the Politburo Standing Committee -- the Communist Party's top body, headed by President Xi Jinping -- has taken direct control of the response. Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Wuhan Monday for a personal inspection of hospitals in the stricken city.  The unprecedented scale of the response speaks in part to the sheer size of China -- 60 million people is greater than the entire population of South Korea, and Hubei spans the equivalent area as Syria. Such a lockdown has never been carried out in China before, not even during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The cost of it is staggering, not just in terms of manpower or funds, but also the economic hit Hubei will take and the knock on effect this will have on the wider Chinese economy during a sensitive period.  That China is able to pull something like this off is thanks to the ability of a centralized, powerful leadership to react in a crisis. It's also a sign of just how vital it is for that leadership not to screw up  Writing on Sunday , analysts Adam Ni and Yun Jiang said that the Chinese Communist Party's "prestige and legitimacy are both on the line" in how they handle the crisis.  "Having realized just how serious this is, and how potentially destabilizing it is for the Party, the Party is now scrambling to fully mobilize resources to tackle the crisis," they added.  "Xi's prestige is likely to take a hit, putting pressure towards collective leadership instead of the paramount leader model. Centralization of power under Xi means that inevitably Xi will take the blame if things go wrong , as would he be showered with glory when things go right. This is high risk, high reward for him."  Contrasting response  As more and more becomes known about the initial spread of the virus and the dangers posed by it, suspicion has grown over how authorities in Wuhan handled the first weeks of the outbreak.  While there is always some uncertainty at first with regard to new pathogens, that officials in Wuhan held a major provincial Communist Party meeting, an attempt at a world record for the largest potluck lunch involving 40,000 families, and had police go after people spreading "rumors" about the virus online, does not cast them in the most positive light.  Many observers have speculated that some officials will be punished in the days and weeks to come, especially after Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted on state TV that the city's warnings "were not sufficient" and the infection rate will likely continue to climb.  There is also the almost staggering contrast in how the crisis has been handled since the central government got involved. Xi himself last week ordered "all-out efforts" to contain the virus' spread and treat those affected, about a month after the virus was first detected.  Beijing-based commentator Wang Xiangwei described that as a "watershed moment."  However, he added that the slow response from local officials was likely the result of "deeply entrenched issues," ones that may have actually been exacerbated by Xi's much vaunted anti-corruption campaign.  "Ironically, the Chinese leadership's keen efforts to push for accountability from bureaucrats and promise stiffer punishment for those who shirk responsibilities have contributed to their propensity to cover up disasters," Wang said. "As Xi has consolidated his power and urged other officials to conform completely to the Party leadership, this has also strengthened a tendency to avoid making any important decisions and instead wait for specific instructions from the Party leadership."  Huge effort  With more than a dozen countries now reporting cases of the virus, along with almost every region of China, the ability to rein in the pathogen's spread may be somewhat out of the hands of the Chinese government.  All eyes will be on the World Health Organization this week, to see if it reverses the decision to hold off on classifying the Wuhan virus as a "public health emergency of international concern." Doing so could enable a more concerted international response, though many affected countries have already independently begun putting in the types of screenings and quarantines that might be recommended.  Inside China, since January 22 when Xi intervened the government response has been colossal, but this does not seem to be having the desired effect, perhaps because of how far the virus spread before a reaction was ordered.  Construction continues at a field hospital on January 26, 2020 in Wuhan.  Two brand new hospitals are being constructed in Wuhan itself to aid its overstretched healthcare system, due to be completed by next week, while an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- will soon arrive in the city.  But the hugely advanced infrastructure that China is relying on to contain the virus and transport aid and support to where it's needed, is also what helped spread the pathogen in the first place.  A month ago, few outside China may have heard of Wuhan, yet the city -- and a small wildlife market within it -- has managed to impact countries the world over; a sign of just how connected we all are in a globalized world. Attempting to control this inter-connectivity, as China's and other governments must do to stop the virus, may be far harder than reaping the economic benefits.  The stringent measures placed on Hubei have also attracted criticism. Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Zhang Xuezhong denounced them as "savage" online, earning him the opprobrium of many panicked commentators. They may also carry major downsides in the long run, Xi Chen, a public health expert at Yale University, pointed out that lockdowns not only have negative economic repercussions but also break down the "social cohesion that binds people at this special moment."  As Xi and the rest of the Standing Committee meet this week to discuss how to tackle the virus's continued spread, they may decide on more draconian tactics. Whether their response is successful remains to be seen, as perhaps the world's most powerful state apparatus grapples with what has bedeviled many of its predecessors -- the sheer size and scale of China itself.
2020-01-27	Facebook has restricted non-essential employee travel to China and has asked its China-based employees to work from home, a Facebook source confirmed to CNN Monday.  The move comes amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, the source added.  The California-based company is also asking employees who have recently returned from China to work from home, according to the source.
2020-01-28	Hong Kong (CNN) Hong Kong announced Tuesday that it was closing many of its border crossings with mainland China in a bid to contain the Wuhan coronavirus , as the death toll from the outbreak topped 100 , with more than 4,600 cases in the mainland.  The virus has also spread globally to more than 17 countries. On Tuesday, experts from the German Robert-Koch-Institute said they believed that a man who tested positive for coronavirus in Germany is the first case of human-to-human infection in Europe.  Carrie Lam, Hong Kong chief executive, told a news conference that the closure of crossings into the semi-autonomous Chinese city would be "temporary." Lam added that the city was also slashing the number of tourist visas it issues to visitors from mainland China, and halving the number of inbound flights from the mainland.  Authorities in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak, earlier said an additional 1,300 cases had been confirmed, bringing the total in the region to over 2,700. The majority of those are still in hospital, with more than 125 in critical condition. Between Sunday and Monday, there was a 65% jump in the number of reported cases in mainland China, from around 2,700 to over 4,500.  Elsewhere in China, cases have been confirmed in every province and territory except for Tibet, which this week announced the indefinite closure of all tourist attractions and a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travelers entering the region.  The move to close off Hong Kong comes after intense pressure from lawmakers and medical unions, one of which had threatened to strike if the border was not shut.  On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a level 3 alert warning against "all nonessential travel to China" -- its highest alert on a scale of 1 to 3.  "There is an ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that can be spread from person to person," the CDC said in a statement, warning "there is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas."  Worldwide concern  More than a dozen countries around the world have confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus, as authorities struggle to stop its spread.  Across Asia, numerous countries have put in extra screening at airports and warned citizens to avoid travel to China. To China's north, neighboring Mongolia has imposed stringent border checks on travelers coming into the country, while Hong Kong earlier banned all visitors from Wuhan.  Indonesia and the Philippines have both introduced extra restrictions on Chinese tourists, while Japan has upgraded its response, allowing authorities to "force the suspicious cases for hospitalization and testing."  Three cases of Wuhan coronavirus were identified in France on Friday and on Tuesday German officials confirmed that a 33-year-old man who had not traveled to China tested positive for the virus.  Speaking at a meeting with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres Monday, China's ambassador to the UN said the country has "full capability and confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic."  "Putting the interests of the people first, China has taken rapid and strong measures, putting in place a nationwide prevention and control mechanism," Ambassador Zhang Jun said.  "China has been working with the international community in the spirit of openness, transparency and scientific coordination. With a great sense of responsibility, China is sparing no effort in curbing the spread of disease and saving lives. Now is a crucial moment, and China has full capability and confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic."  Some 60 million people have been placed under travel restrictions in Hubei, with almost all movement in and out of Wuhan itself stopped and much of the city on lockdown.  Officials have also cracked down on the trade of wild animals , after the Wuhan coronavirus was linked to a seafood market selling exotic live mammals, including bats and civet cats, which have previously been linked to the 2003 SARS outbreak.  Rapid spread  The first cases of the coronavirus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased a thousandfold, and infections have been reported worldwide.  Hospitals in Wuhan are already massively overstretched, and hundreds of emergency medical personnel have been dispatched to the city to help. Two new hospitals are also being built on the city's outskirts, due to be operational by next week.  Wuhan and Hubei officials have faced criticism for apparently downplaying the danger of the virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. There was a marked shift in the handling of the crisis once the national government got involved on January 22.  Despite the colossal effort -- and potential social and economic cost -- of effectively quarantining Hubei, it appears that this has come too late to stop the virus' spread. By the time Wuhan introduced even basic screening of travelers leaving the city, the virus had been reported in Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and spread to most of the rest of China.  Part of the problem is that the virus can apparently be spread before symptoms appear, according to China's health minister, Ma Xiaowei.  "It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought," William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN. "This is worse than we anticipated."  While the current outbreak does not appear to be as deadly as SARS, which killed over 700 people worldwide, it may be spreading more rapidly. That could be due to being more contagious, or the increased interconnectedness of both China and the world than in 2003.  As of mid-March 2003 , roughly a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to SARS by Chinese authorities, and three months after the first cases were detected in China, the number of confirmed cases worldwide stood at around 3,200, with 159 confirmed deaths.  Growing fears in Hong Kong  Fears of the virus' spread have led to calls for increased action in multiple countries and territories, not least in Hong Kong, where memories of SARS still run deep.  Effective midnight on Thursday until further notice, Lam said Hong Kong's measures also include decreasing the number of inbound buses from the mainland, and the suspension of cross-border coach services at the Hong Kong-Zuhai-Macau Bridge. All cross-border ferry services will also be suspended.  Operations at Hong Kong's West Kowloon Train Station -- which operates high speed rail services to the mainland -- will shut. Passenger services will also be temporarily suspended at the border crossings of Hung Hom, Sha Tau Kok, and Man Kam To.  In addition to the closing many of its borders with China, the city's government announced that government workers would be encouraged to work from home when the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Wednesday. The directive, which excluded emergency service workers and people who work for essential public services, urged the private sector to enforce similar arrangements.  The sweeping moves follow calls from one of the city's leading health experts for "substantial draconian measures" to limit population mobility in order to rein in the virus. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong, warned that the number of cases could potentially double every six days in the absence of decisive government action.  "This epidemic is growing at quite a fast rate and it's accelerating," said Leung, who is also the founding director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infection Disease Epidemiology and Control in Hong Kong. He predicted the actual number of cases -- including those who are incubating the virus but not yet showing symptoms -- could be 10 times what has been reported.  Leung's team modeled two scenarios -- one with a population quarantine as has been seen in Wuhan and one without -- but found more or less identical results, because the virus has already spread to other major population centers in China, which could soon see their own self-sustaining epidemics.  Leung said the findings had concerned the team enough that it felt the need to alert the authorities and the public, predicting a peak of cases between April and May.  He added people need to prepare for a potential global pandemic -- though "not a certainty by any stretch of the imagination ... we must prepare better for it," he said.
2020-01-28	A senior administration official is denying a report that the White House has asked US airlines to suspend flights between the US and China as a way to help contain the spread the deadly coronavirus.  “The White House did not call the airlines and hasn’t asked for a suspension of flights between the US and China,” the official said.  A White House aide said that at a Monday session looking at ways to contain the spread of the virus, the notion of travel restrictions to China was raised. And on Tuesday, Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar declined to rule out such a possibility, saying nothing was off the table.  Azar also told reporters that he and Trump were "speaking regularly" about the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected close to 6,000 people in China and that he was in daily contact with White House officials.  "The President is highly engaged in this response and closely monitoring the work we're doing to keep Americans safe," Azar said.  A White House source described the attitude toward coronavirus as a "sense of urgency, not panic." Inside the White House, the government's cross-agency response is being coordinated by the National Security Council, with Matt Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, leading near daily meetings, according to administration officials.
2020-01-28	(CNN) A California-bound flight chartered by the US State Department left the China city at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday morning local time, a department spokesman said.  About 240 Americans could be on the flight from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. It will stop to refuel in Anchorage, Alaska, before arriving early Wednesday at a military base near Riverside, California -- instead of a nearby civilian airport in Ontario, California, as first planned.  The plane will land at March Air Reserve Base instead of Ontario International Airport, officials said. No reason was immediately given for the change in itinerary.  While in Anchorage, passengers will be screened by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials, who will decide if they are healthy enough to continue on to California.  "Any passenger(s) who are found to have cough, fever, or shortness of breath in Anchorage will be further assessed by CDC and DHSS medical experts," a news release from the Alaska DHSS says.

2020-01-28	Hong Kong (CNN) The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has overtaken the 2003 SARS outbreak inside of mainland China, as multiple countries evacuated their citizens from the city at the heart of the outbreak.  As of Wednesday, there were 6,061 confirmed cases of the virus in mainland China, including 132 deaths, according to Chinese officials. The number of cases grew by around 1,500 from Tuesday, a more than 30% increase. The figures do not include Hong Kong and Macau, both of which have reported a small number of cases.  There have also been at least 91 cases of the virus reported outside mainland China.  Wuhan's Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang said Tuesday that testing had been streamlined in recent days, leading to a spike in diagnoses. "This does not mean the speed of the disease spreading has increased drastically," he added.  Authorities in China also reported a suspected case of the Wuhan virus in Tibet, previously the only region to have avoided the virus . If confirmed, the spread to Tibet despite the implementation of strict checks on travelers and closing of tourist sites will renew concerns about how easily the virus is transmitted, particularly when people are asymptomatic.  The semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, which has reported eight cases of the virus, announced Tuesday it was closing many of its border crossings with mainland China, slashing the number of tourist visas it issues to mainland Chinese visitors, and halving the number of inbound flights from the mainland.  Hong Kong has also instructed government employees to work from home for the rest of the week, and requested private companies do the same. The streets and public transport were noticeably quiet on Wednesday morning, the first day back from the Lunar New Year holiday.  Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday vowed to do everything to tackle the "demon" epidemic.  Speaking during a meeting with World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom in Beijing, Xi said the Chinese people "are engaging in a serious battle against the outbreak of the new coronavirus."  "People's lives and health are always the first priority for the Chinese government, and the prevention and control of the epidemic is the most important task at present, so I have been directing and deploying the works myself," Xi added. "I believe as long as we can strengthen our confidence, stand together, scientifically prevent and control the epidemic and adopt precise measures, we will definitely defeat this epidemic."  First evacuees leave Wuhan  Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province at the center of the virus outbreak, is on effective lockdown and countries have begun repatriating their citizens trapped there.  A flight carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo Wednesday morning. The passengers are all quarantined on board and those with any pneumonia-like symptoms will be taken to a special medical center for treatment. Passengers without symptoms will be taken to separate hospitals for further screening.  Around 450 more Japanese citizens have not yet departed. Japanese citizens who live close to the Huanan Seafood Market -- pinpointed by Chinese authorities as the likely source of the virus -- and highly populated areas in Wuhan were given priority on the first flight.  A plane carrying approximately 210 US citizens -- mostly diplomats and their families -- has also left Wuhan, according to a State Department spokesperson, bound for Riverside, California via Alaska. More Americans remain in the city, hoping to be evacuated at a later date.  The plane had originally been destined for California's Ontario International Airport, but officials said late Tuesday that it would instead land at a military base near Riverside. No reason was immediately given for the change in itinerary.  As of early Wednesday morning, the plane had landed in Anchorage, Alaska, where it will refuel before heading on to the US west coast. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services said passengers will undergo health screenings there to ensure they are not experiencing coronavirus symptoms before traveling onward.  After landing in the US, passengers will be placed in isolation for between three days and two weeks, a California official told CNN earlier. Doctors have previously recommended a two-week quarantine for people exposed to the virus.  South Korea and New Zealand are chartering flights to bring their citizens home. More controversially, Australia said it will charter a flight to fetch citizens, but they will be transported to quarantine on Christmas Island, site of a former offshore detention camp for migrants.  Virus spreads worldwide  The first cases of the coronavirus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. Since then, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially, and infections have been reported worldwide.  Hospitals in Wuhan are already massively overstretched, and hundreds of emergency medical personnel have been dispatched to the city to help. Two new hospitals dedicated to treating the virus are also being built on the city's outskirts, due to be operational by next week.  Authorities in the city said that as of January 27 there were still more than 4,000 Wuhan residents overseas. The Wuhan culture and tourism bureau said that all tour groups were canceled after the lockdown was announced, but groups that left prior to that date were still slowly returning to the city.  More than a dozen countries have confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus, as authorities struggle to stop its spread.  Across Asia, many countries have put in extra screening at airports and warned citizens to avoid travel to China. To China's north, neighboring Mongolia has imposed stringent border checks on travelers coming into the country. Indonesia and the Philippines have both introduced extra restrictions on Chinese tourists, while Japan has upgraded its response, allowing authorities to "force the suspicious cases for hospitalization and testing."  Around a hundred cases have been reported worldwide, with the most, 14, detected in Thailand, a popular destination for Chinese travelers. Countries with colder climates are more at risk for future spread, as coronaviruses thrive in cold environments and do not transmit as well in sunny, hot locales.  While most cases reported outside of China have a direct link to Wuhan, there are indications the virus is beginning to spread within other countries. Three new cases were reported in Germany on Tuesday, including what is believed to be the first human-to-human transmission in Europe.  Multiple countries have advised citizens not to visit China due to the ongoing outbreak. On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a level 3 alert advising against all "nonessential travel" -- its highest alert on a scale of 1 to 3. However, the White House denied reports suggesting it was planning to suspend all flights between the US and China.  Cases will continue to spread  With much of China seeing the type of cold weather ideal for the coronavirus, and uncertainty remaining on just how contagious it is, experts expect the number of cases to continue to rise for several weeks.  Speaking to state media Tuesday , Zhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the peak to come in up to 10 days.  "It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases," Zhong said.  However, other experts have warned that while the outbreak in Hubei may peak in the coming weeks, other Chinese megacities may see self-sustaining epidemics that continue to spread the pathogen around the country and worldwide.  "We modeled epidemic curves out to August 2020 for all the major city clusters: Chongqing, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing. Chongqing is predicted to have the largest epidemic due to large population and most intense traffic volume coupled to Wuhan," Gabriel Leung, a leading Hong Kong researcher and public health expert, said earlier this week.  He said outbreaks in China's largest cities could peak in April or May and gradually slow in June and July.  A laboratory in Australia became the first outside of China to grow the Wuhan coronavirus from a patient sample, it announced Wednesday. Doing so will "provide expert international laboratories with crucial information to help combat the virus," the scientists said.  During a news conference on Wednesday, Mike Catton, director of the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory said "we are proud to have grown the virus in such a short space of time" and added they will "share this with international colleagues" to help with the developments of vaccines and medicines.  Catton added that this successful growth will "help us understand the epidemiology of the outbreak."  UPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect the status of a suspected case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Tibet.
2020-01-28	(CNN) Hundreds of Americans who returned to the United States Wednesday from the epicenter of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak are voluntarily quarantined at the March Air Reserve Base in southern California.  Evacuees aren't required to stay in base housing, but US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said passengers were asked to stay for three days of testing and monitoring, and they are willing. If a passenger demanded to leave before the three-day period had passed, it would be a discussion "up to the highest levels within the US government," officials said during a press conference on Wednesday.  After three days without symptoms or positive tests, passengers are free to stay at the base or return to their homes, where they will be monitored throughout a 14-day incubation period.  Any passenger exhibiting symptoms will be transported to a hospital for further evaluation, the CDC said.  "We try and balance how to protect these people, how to respect their rights, how to be as least restrictive as possible and still be very careful about the evaluation that they go under so that everybody is safe," the CDC's Dr. Chris Braden said during the press conference. "This is a balance and if we can do that without a federal quarantine order that restricts people and takes away their rights, that's what we will do."  Read More
2020-01-29	(CNN) Countries are scrambling to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, as the number of cases overtake the 2003 SARS outbreak inside mainland China.  Flights have been chartered and various quarantine measures have been put in place, ranging from a special medical center to being placed in a detention center in the Indian Ocean.  It comes as the worldwide total rose to more than 6,000 confirmed cases of the virus -- after a 30% increase in reported infections on mainland China overnight.  Australia  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Wednesday the evacuation will be aided by the country's flag carrier Qantas Airways.  There are more than 600 Australian citizens in Hubei, according to CNN affiliate Nine News, and Morrison said there will be a focus on repatriating "the young, especially infants, and the elderly."  "I stress that this will be done on a last in, first out basis," he said. "They would have been shorter-term travelers to that area, they would not have been living there for many years and we are particularly focused on the more vulnerable component."  The returning Australians will be quarantined on Christmas Island -- more than 1,000 miles away from Australia in the Indian Ocean.  Once there, the Australians will be quarantined for as long as 14 days. "But that will be subject to the medical advice we receive," Morrison added.  The decision has drawn uncomfortable comparisons with the plight of refugees living in a controversial detention center for asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat.  There have been repeated allegations of abuse and even torture of those held in Australia's offshore detention facilities.  Morrison said Australian returnees would be quarantined for as long as 14 days -- subject to medical advice.  European Union  Two planes will be sent to Wuhan to help evacuate European Union citizens, Janez Lenarcic, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said in a statement Tuesday.  The first plane left France on Wednesday morning, "while the second one will leave later this week," the statement added. Other flights may follow in the coming days.  Around 250 French citizens will be transported in the first aircraft, while 100 people from other EU countries will take the second plane.  "EU citizens in the region who want to be repatriated to their home countries can request it, no matter their nationality," the statement added.  The worldwide total went up to more than 6,000 confirmed cases.  Countries within the EU, such as France and Germany, have planned their own repatriation procedures.  Germany  German evacuations are planned to start in the next few days, the Germany Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.  France  A plane will be sent Thursday to repatriate French citizens, according to France's health ministry. It is expected to take passengers without symptoms of the virus.  "A second flight carrying French nationals who may be carrying the virus is also being planned," Deputy Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari told French television channel CNews on Tuesday.  There are around 800 French citizens in Wuhan.  Italy  Italy said it would begin repatriating its citizens from Wuhan this week.  The flight, set to depart Italy on Thursday, will come with medical personnel.  Spain  Spain's government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya tweeted Tuesday.  "Close coordination is being carried out with the rest of the European partners to expedite the necessary procedures, and also with the Chinese authorities in compliance with the sanitary protocols required for repatriation," Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said a communique published Monday.  India  The Indian government has begun the process of "preparing to evacuate" Indian nationals affected by situation in Hubei Province, a spokesman confirmed Wednesday.  Screening of passengers started at various airports in India, the Ministry of Health tweeted Wednesday  "Screening of passengers started at #Mohali airport, while medical teams in preparedness at Raja Sansi #Amritsar airport," tweeted the Health Ministry  New Zealand  New Zealand will evacuate its citizens in joint cooperation with Australia, its government said Wednesday.  It is unclear whether the New Zealanders will join the repatriated Australians on Christmas Island.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement that "specific details of the evacuation plan, including the medical protocols that will be applied to returning New Zealanders and access arrangements on the ground in China, are being worked through by officials."  Japan  A flight carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday morning on a chartered flight operated by ANA.  People wearing masks walk through the Ginza shopping district in Tokyo.  Around 440 more Japanese citizens wish to return, and the government is arranging a schedule. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the government is preparing to send a second and third chartered flight to Wuhan.  The passengers who return to Tokyo will be quarantined on board and those with any pneumonia-like symptoms will be taken to a special medical center for treatment. Passengers without symptoms will be taken to separate hospitals for further screening.  Japanese citizens who live close to the Huanan Seafood Market -- pinpointed by Chinese authorities as the likely source of the virus -- and highly-populated areas in Wuhan were given priority on the first flight.  South Korea  Four charter flights were sent to Wuhan on Wednesday, where almost 700 South Korean citizens have applied to fly out.  Citizens will bear the cost of the flight, and those who wish to fly will be inspected by a medical team from Seoul before being allowed to board the plane.  Returnees will be quarantined in a government facility.  Turkey  More than two dozen Turkish citizens in Wuhan will be evacuated in the next couple of days, the Turkish ambassador in China, Abdulkadir Emin Onen, told Haberturk news channel on Wednesday.  Two residents walk in an empty Jiangtan park in Wuhan, China.  The 32 citizens are a mix of Wuhan residents, tourists and people there for business, he said, adding they are in good health with "no virus detected," but will be quarantined for some time on their return to Turkey.  It is unclear whether the plane will land in the capital, Ankara, or Istanbul.  United Kingdom  Britain had planned to bring British citizens in Wuhan back to the United Kingdom on Thursday but had to delay the flight, a UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Wednesday. Around 200 people were due to be on the flight, Britain's Press Association reported.  It was understood the flight was delayed due to Chinese permissions that did not come through.  "We are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK. A number of countries' flights have been unable to take off as planned. We continue working urgently to organize a flight to the UK as soon as possible," the spokeswoman said.  "We remain in close contact with the Chinese authorities and conversations are ongoing at all levels," the spokeswoman added.  British Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted Wednesday that anyone returning from Wuhan will be isolated for 14 days "with all neccessary medical attention."  United States  A chartered plane carrying approximately 201 US citizens -- mostly diplomats and their families -- arrived at March Air Reserve Base in southern California on Wednesday, where health officials were screening passengers.  More Americans remain in Wuhan, hoping to be evacuated at a later date. The State Department said it was unable to accommodate everyone on the flight because of space limitations but is working to identify alternative routes for US citizens to depart Wuhan by land.  "The way this plane was put together, the upper level with the crew was completely separated from the lower passengers," Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska's chief medical officer, said in a news conference.  The Boeing 747-4B5(F) was used to help repatriate Americans.  "So air flow, every sort of interaction between the top and bottom were completely isolated and the crew never got off in China; and there was never any interaction with the passengers," Zink explained.  There was no blanket quarantine for the passengers when they arrived in California, though several said they would stay at the base voluntarily, said Dr. Chris Braden of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The plan is to hold the passengers for three days, monitoring them for a fever and other symptoms at least twice daily, Braden said.
2020-01-29	(CNN) Health officials will not issue a blanket quarantine for the nearly 200 Americans who landed at a California military base following their evacuation from Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China.  The plan is to monitor passengers at the base for three days, checking them for fever and other symptoms at least twice daily, said Dr. Chris Braden, deputy director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  If health officials determine they pose low or no risk of infecting others, they can go home but will need to be monitored by local officials for the 14-day incubation period, he said. The patients staying at March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, California, might also choose to remain there for the 14 days.  Should anyone demand to go home within the first 72 hours, an individual quarantine is an option, Braden said.  "If anyone demands to leave right now, that is where all of the partners ... would come together and talk about what needs to be done," said Dr. Nancy Knight, the CDC's director of the division of global health protection, noting that US marshals are on hand to ensure everyone's safety.  Some passengers told Braden they'd stay voluntarily, he said.  "They wanted to know their own status. They wanted to know the status of their children. They wanted to protect their family, They wanted to protect others," he said.

There, local officials began working with the CDC to thoroughly screen each passenger again following other screenings by American and Chinese health officials in Wuhan.  The CDC cleared all passengers, most of whom are American diplomatic corps or their families, to continue on to California, Alaska officials said.  Passengers were screened in an isolated area of the Anchorage airport's north terminal, which handles international flights, and had no impact on general travel, airport manager Jim Szczesniak said.  The CDC will work with airport officials to clean the terminal, and there are no international flights scheduled at the airport until May, he said.  Passengers applauded when they arrived in the US  Passenger Scott Allis told CNN they received a hot meal in Anchorage, while Darby Siebels said passengers had a chance to charge their phones before getting back on the plane after 1 a.m. (5 a.m. ET).

Priority was given to US citizens at risk  The passengers include US diplomats and their families. The State Department said other US citizens could board on a reimbursable basis if space was available.  While there are about 1,000 Americans living in Wuhan, priority was given to US citizens who are " most at risk for contracting coronavirus " if they stay in the city, the State Department said.

It ordered personnel working at the US Consulate in Wuhan to depart for the United States.  Other countries including South Korea and Japan are sending charters to evacuate citizens from the epicenter of the outbreak. The European Commission said it was sending two aircraft to evacuate European Union citizens from Wuhan.
2020-01-29	A student at Arizona State University has started a petition to cancel classes after someone from the university was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus.  ASU freshman Taskina Bhuiyan, who is majoring in microbiology, started the petition on Change.org, and it had more than 21,000 signatures as of Wednesday evening.  It is unclear whether the infected person is a student or staff member. The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) identified the person only as a "member of the Arizona State University community who does not live in university housing."  The person recently returned from Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated.  "As part of our case investigation, individuals who may have been exposed to the patient will be notified by public health and provided with proper follow-up," ADHS communications director Chris Minnick told CNN.  The ADHS said the patient is not severely ill. The patient is being kept in isolation to prevent the illness from spreading, according to the health department.  Keep reading.

2020-01-30	China's National Health Commission has announced that as of the end-of Thursday January 30, the total number of confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in mainland China had risen to 9,692.  That's a jump of 1,982 from the previous day, with the total figure now far exceeding the number of cases associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 -- previously among Asia's worst outbreaks.  The death toll in mainland China has now reached 213, with 42 new deaths occurring in Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak, and one in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
2020-01-30	Hong Kong (CNN) The United States and other countries issued strict travel restrictions for foreign nationals who traveled to China as the number of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak continued rising on Friday.  A day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global health emergency , Chinese authorities reported 45 deaths, all of them in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak of which Wuhan is the capital, bringing the total death toll across the country to 258.  As of Friday, there were more than 10,000 coronavirus cases confirmed in China, authorities said, an increase of over 2,000 from the previous day. That surpasses the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that began in southern China, which infected 8,098 people worldwide, killing 774.  More than 20 countries and territories outside of mainland China have confirmed cases of the virus -- spanning Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East -- as the United Kingdom reported its first two cases on Friday.  On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last two weeks and could pose a risk of spreading the virus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.  Foreign nationals who are the immediate family of US citizens or permanent residents are exempt. US citizens returning to the United States who have been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks before their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said.  The decision by the WHO prompted governments to upgrade their own response to the virus, with the US State Department raising its travel advisory for China to it's highest level: Do not travel.  The WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as "an extraordinary event" that constitutes a "public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease," and "to potentially require a coordinated international response." Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1.  Ghebreyesus, who met this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, said the WHO "continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."  "We would have seen many more cases outside China by now -- and probably deaths -- if it were not for the government's efforts," he added.  Much of China goes back to work on Monday, after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended in an attempt to rein in the virus. The fear now -- as tens of millions of people travel across the country and cities return to usual business -- is that new self-sustaining epidemic spots will rear up.  Many schools and universities across the country will remain closed for much of next week.  JUST WATCHED American student in Shanghai: It's like 'Zombieland' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH American student in Shanghai: It's like 'Zombieland' 02:40  Evacuation and spread  As Wuhan and much of Hubei remains on lockdown in a bid to contain the virus, many countries have begun extracting their citizens from the city.  A charter plane carrying more than 350 South Koreans landed at Gimpo International Airport near Seoul on Friday, following flights organized by the US and Japan to evacuate their citizens. Multiple other governments, including the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are still arranging flights.  Meanwhile, more cases of the virus have been reported worldwide. Singapore confirmed three additional cases Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the city to 13.  Health officials said all 13 cases are in a stable condition and "most are improving." They also advised citizens to "defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China."  The Singapore government said it will distribute four masks each to 1.3 million households in the city from Saturday. Other Asian territories, particularly Hong Kong, have struggled to maintain supply of masks, with many stores running out following an initial rush by residents to stock up.  More than 130 infections with the virus -- but no deaths -- have been reported outside mainland China.  The UK has confirmed its first two cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the northwest of England, according to a statement by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England.  "We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS (National Health Service) care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus," he said.  "The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread," he added.  "We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities."  Two of China's neighbors have instituted emergency measures to try and stop the virus spreading there. Russia said it was closing its border in the Far East, and limiting rail services from all of China from January 31. Meanwhile, North Korea declared a state of emergency and said it was instituting a "hygienic and anti-epidemic" response.  Work continues on Wuhan Huoshenshan hospital on January 30, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The 1,000-bed hospital is scheduled to open on February 5.  Facing a long quarantine  Much of Hubei has been under effective quarantine for weeks now, with almost every city facing travel restrictions in a province home to nearly 60 million people. Wuhan has been completely locked down, with residents cooped up in their homes and the streets abandoned.  Foreigners being airlifted out of the city are also facing up to two weeks of mandatory or voluntary quarantine once they land in their home countries.  However, this has sparked controversy in some countries, especially in Australia, where a plan to house evacuees in a former detention center for migrants on Christmas Island has generated no small amount of negative publicity .  Public broadcaster ABC spoke to some Australians in Wuhan who said they would rather remain in the city than face two weeks on what has been described by some opposition lawmakers as a "leper camp," even as Canberra defended its decision as the only place capable of quarantining hundreds of people.  At March Air Reserve Base in Southern California, where US evacuees were flown earlier this week, one man said he was willing to remain under quarantine "as long as I need."  Jarred Evans said that the US Centers for Disease Control told evacuees that the initial 72-hour quarantine that was suggested "is really not enough time, but you know, they're not obligated to keep us here."  "You're not obligated to leave (when the 72 hours are up), so they're saying that the best thing for you, your people, your family and the community is to stay as long as possible," Evans said.  After flying out of near-freezing temperatures in Wuhan, Evans said he and the other passengers were spending time outdoors enjoying the sunny, 22 degrees Celsius (72F) weather.  "We're all still taking major precautions. So it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that," Evans said. "We're wearing our masks ... But honestly, you know, everyone is enjoying themselves because what we experienced, what we've seen, is very serious, you know, people are dying. So when you see that and think about things like that, try to take as much appreciation of what is in front of you."  What happens next?  Speaking on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry said the country had full "confidence and capability" in winning the fight against the virus.  "Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese government has been taking the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures with a high sense of responsibility for people's health," said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in a statement. "Many of these measures go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations. We have full confidence and capability to win this fight against the epidemic."  China has taken major measures to try and contain the epidemic, locking much of Hubei down, partially closing the border with Hong Kong and extending the Lunar New Year holiday, all of which could have a severe drain on the country's economy, already vulnerable due to the US-China trade war.  With most people due to go back to work on Monday, it remains unclear whether more measures will be announced, and if not, how this will influence the spread of the virus.  Health experts previously estimated that the number of cases could be far higher than currently confirmed. Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18, almost a week before the lockdown began. Their model suggests a low national figure of 20,000 infections by the end of the month, potentially as high as 100,000.  Researchers in Hong Kong estimate there could be 75,815 people in Wuhan infected with coronavirus as of January 25, according to a paper published Friday in The Lancet.  UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the number of confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus outside mainland China.
2020-01-31	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for nearly 200 Americans who returned from Wuhan, China, is the first such order in more than 50 years.  “While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat, and this is one of the tools in our toolbox to mitigate the potential impact of this novel virus on the United States,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, referring to the coronavirus that has sickened thousands in China.  The 195 Americans, many of them diplomats and their families, flew from Wuhan to California on Wednesday. They’ve been staying at March Air Reserve Base since then under a three-day voluntary quarantine.  “We believe that this approach of having a quarantine for the incubation period offers the greatest level of protection for the American public in preventing introduction and spread,” Cetron said. “That is our primary concern.”  CDC officials thanked quarantined individuals for their flexibility. Cetron said most of the passengers were “exuberant and elated to be out of harm’s way” during their journey from Wuhan, and they understand the need for a longer quarantine.  Cetron noted there are cons to quarantine – if they aren’t done properly, if there’s fear and stigma or if people aren’t treated with respect.  “We’re taking every measure possible to ensure these people are treated with dignity and respect,” Cetron said.  One quarantined individual had previously tried to leave the base. CDC officials declined to offer more information about that person.  There are currently six confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus in the US – one in Arizona, two in California, two in Illinois and one in Washington.  Some historical context: A quarantine order like this was last used in the 1960s for smallpox evaluation, Dr. Marti Cetron, director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said Friday during a telebriefing with reporters.
2020-01-31	According to Chinese health authorities, the number of confirmed cases grew by 2,102 on Friday, bringing the total to 11,791 nationwide. An additional 45 people died in Hubei -- the province at the epicenter of the outbreak -- and one person died in the megacity of Chongqing on Friday, as the number of fatalities reached 259.  The pronounced increase in cases and deaths show the virus is not slowing, even after over a week of much of Hubei being under partial quarantine and an extended Lunar New Year holiday. With most of China due to return to work on Monday, the concern will be how far the virus will now spread, and whether the country's economy can bear the type of further quarantines and travel restrictions that may be necessary to rein it in.  Worldwide the total number of cases now stands at 11,940, with 149 confirmed cases outside of China, including seven in the United States, two in the United Kingdom, four in Canada, nine in Australia and 13 in Singapore.  Washington announced Friday that it will impose a 14-day travel ban on all visitors from China, regardless of their nationality. US citizens arriving from Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital, will have to undergo 14-days mandatory quarantine on arrival, while those traveling any other part of China will face screening and monitoring.  The mandatory quarantine is the first time the US has issued such an order in 50 years. The move came as the seventh case of the virus was confirmed in the US, an adult male in California who recently traveled to Wuhan.  China criticized the move , with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying it went against World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations not to impose travel bans.  "A friend in need is a friend indeed. Many countries have offered China support in various means," she said. "In sharp contrast, certain US officials' words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate."  It may be part of a growing trend, however. The US ban comes after Singapore banned all visitors from mainland China, saying anyone who had been in the country in the past 14 days will not be able to visit or transit through the city state. Taiwan has also suspended visa applications for Chinese nationals, and banned entry to any from Hubei province.  Other countries have seen a wave of ugly xenophobia and racism directed at Chinese travelers and those of Chinese heritage. In a statement last week, health authorities in Toronto warned concerns about the virus and misinformation were creating "unnecessary stigma against members of our community."  JUST WATCHED Coronavirus declared a global health emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus declared a global health emergency 02:56  How long will it go on?  China has allocated almost $4 billion to the fight against the virus, and sent thousands of doctors, nurses and military medics to Hubei to help out with relief in the epicenter of the outbreak.  Two purpose-built hospitals in Wuhan, constructed in under a week, are due to start accepting patients on Monday and Thursday respectively. They have 2,500 beds between them, and will be focused purely on dealing with confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus, providing some relief to Wuhan's stretched health system.  On Friday, the country's National Health Commission (NHC) said it was "confident in and capable of effectively containing the novel coronavirus epidemic, and eventually defeating it," following the WHO's classification of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).  The Lunar New Year holiday will be extended in Hubei to an "appropriate extent," the Communist Party group in charge of the virus response said Friday. People in Hubei who work elsewhere in the country were also "granted an extended holiday and were asked to stay put," according to state-run news agency Xinhua  It remains unclear, however, how long parts of the country can continue to remain under lockdown, both from the perspective of making sure they are supplied with food and other necessary items, and from an economic point -- both the national finances and people's personal pocketbooks will be taking a massive hit from next week.  Worst of all, this sacrifice could be for nothing, with cases now reported in every province and region of China.  Researchers in Hong Kong on Friday estimated there could be more than 75,000 people in Wuhan alone infected with the virus. They warned that their model suggested that "epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks."  Study author Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at University of Hong Kong, said in a statement that their predicted number could be much higher than confirmed cases because "not everyone who is infected with (the virus) would require or seek medical attention," thus many may go uncounted. It may also be impacted by the delay between when someone gets infected, when they show symptoms, and when a lab is able to confirm.  Leung and his colleagues' findings come as researchers in the US and Germany confirmed previous suspicions that the virus could be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.  "There's no doubt after reading this paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurring," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, after the research was published Friday. "This study lays the question to rest."  Foreigners flee  With much of Hubei under effective quarantine for the foreseeable future, countries have begun airlifting their citizens from the stricken province. Two dozens countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and South Korea, have chartered planes to carry diplomats and citizens out of Wuhan.  Air traffic in the opposite direction is becoming increasingly sparse. More than 15 international carriers, including British Airways, Air Canada and American Airlines, have suspended some or all flights to and from mainland China.  Markets have dropped across the world on news of the virus' spread, and the expected hit to China's economy that it will result in  The economic impact of the virus is still impossible to determine, but one state media outlet and some economists have said that China's growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter because of the outbreak, which has brought large parts of the country to a standstill. A decline on that scale could mean $62 billion in lost growth.  China can ill afford that kind of hit. Growth last year was already the country's weakest in nearly three decades, as China contended with rising debt and the fallout from its trade war with the US.  Major banks have cut interest rates for small businesses and individuals in the worst-hit areas. And the Bank of China said it would allow people in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province to delay their loan payments for several months if they lose their source of income because of the disruption.  Both tourism and China's film industry are taking a major hit already, with box office receipts at almost nothing since the outbreak. The spread of the coronavirus also threatens to cause job losses and push consumer prices higher, compounding economic woes that already exist.
2020-01-31	(CNN) The novel coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a White House briefing on Friday.  Once the declaration goes into effect at 5 p.m. ET Sunday, US citizens returning to the United States who have been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks before their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine, Azar said.  US citizens returning from the rest of mainland China in the two weeks prior will face a health screening at a select number of ports of entry, he said. Those citizens also face up to two weeks of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they pose no health risk.  President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last two weeks, Azar said, and could pose a risk of spreading the coronavirus. Foreign nationals who are the immediate family of US citizens or permanent residents are exempt.  "These prudent, targeted and temporary actions will decrease the pressure on public health officials screening incoming travelers, expedite the processing of US citizens and permanent residents returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people," Azar said.  "I want to stress: the risk of infection for Americans remains low," he added. "And with these and our previous actions we're working to keep the risk low."  Azar's announcement came as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the seventh confirmed coronavirus case in the US. The seventh patient is an adult male in Santa Clara County in northern California, the third confirmed case in the state.  The man recently traveled to Wuhan, according to health officials. Upon returning to Northern California on January 24, the man self-isolated and did not leave home except to seek medical care, said Dr. Sara Cody, director of Santa Clara County's health department. He was not sick enough to be hospitalized.  The health department is reaching out to everyone the man may have had contact with to determine if they may have been exposed to the virus.  The outbreak has so far killed at least 258 people and infected more than 10,000 others in China, most of them in the Hubei province. There are at least 140 confirmed cases outside of mainland China.  14-day quarantine ordered for evacuated Americans  Earlier Thursday the CDC ordered a federal 14-day quarantine for the 195 Americans on an Air Force base in California recently evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak  It's the first such order in more than 50 years.  "While we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat, and this is one of the tools in our toolbox to mitigate the potential impact of this novel virus on the United States," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  The group of 195 Americans, many of them diplomats and their families, arrived by plane Wednesday at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, and were staying at the base under a three-day voluntary quarantine.  US health officials previously said they wouldn't issue a blanket quarantine for the evacuees, as some agreed to stay at the base voluntarily longer than 72 hours.  Then Thursday, one of the passengers tried to leave the base and was ordered to stay there in quarantine for a 14-day incubation period "or until otherwise cleared," Riverside County Public Health said in a statement.  A longtime CDC adviser told CNN Friday morning the agency should consider extending the three-day quarantine because other countries are doing the same for citizens returning from Wuhan. Those include France, South Korea and Australia.  The CDC adviser pointed to a report published Thursday night in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that infected people can transmit the virus before they develop symptoms.  According to the study, there were five instances of asymptomatic transmission of the Wuhan virus in one cluster. A woman in Shanghai was infected by one of her parents, who had no symptoms. That woman flew to Germany and while she was asymptomatic transmitted the virus to two colleagues. One of those colleagues, while healthy, transmitted the virus to two more coworkers.

"We believe that this approach of having a quarantine for the incubation period offers the greatest level of protection for the American public in preventing introduction and spread," Cetron said. "That is our primary concern."  'Is this a nightmare?'  Jarred Evans, one of the 195 passengers from Wuhan, told CNN Thursday he "will stay as long as I need" at the military base.  The passengers are wearing protective masks and are spending some time outdoors.  "We're all still taking major precautions. So, it's not like we're around here hugging each other and shaking hands and things like that," Evans said.  Evans spent more than a week holed up in his apartment in Wuhan as coronavirus raced through Wuhan before he landed in the US on the chartered flight. During that time, he said, residents sent panicked messages, warning others to take precaution.  "It hit fast and ... it just was very hectic for, like, three days straight," he said. "I got the news from my Chinese friends saying, 'Hey, stay inside. Wear a mask. Don't go outside, stock up on some food because this is going to get serious.' And as you can see, it's very serious."  "When you're there and there's no transportation, no trains, no subways, no planes, the military is blocking off each and every aspect of the road. No Ubers, nothing. Mom and pop stores are closed. You think to yourself, like, is this real? Is this a movie? Is this a nightmare?" he said.
2020-02-01	New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin is once again having a moment.  The cryptocurrency has soared as fears about the coronavirus outbreak send shock waves throughout global stock markets  The price of oneis now hovering around $9,300. Bitcoin is up nearly 10% this week and has gained 30% since the end of 2019. It's the best start to the year for bitcoin since 2012.  Worries about the rapid spread of the coronavirus is one factor boosting bitcoin, an asset that often has gone up when investors are nervous. But it isn't the only factor helping to push bitcoin higher.  "The recent bitcoin rally can be attributed to ongoing economic uncertainties," said Shaun Djie, chief operating officer of digital token company Digix in comments e-mailed to CNN Business.  Djie cited lingering worries about US-China trade relations, Brexit concerns and political tension between Japan and South Korea as factors that have boosted bitcoin prices. But the coronavirus is clearly the biggest catalyst as of late.  "The rise in bitcoin price correlates to the ongoing outbreak," Djie said.  In that sense, bitcoin's latest spike is similar to gold's stellar run this year. The yellow metal has also surged this month and is now trading at a seven-year high.  "Is this peak bullishness for the stock market? Gold and bitcoin are up as investors don't seem convinced about last year's stock rally," said Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist with State Street in an interview with CNN Business.  Veitmane added that bitcoin, as well as gold, is benefiting from the fact that interest rates are low (or in some cases, negative) following cuts by the Federal Reserve and many other central banks last year.  That has led to a decline in the US dollar versus other currencies over the past few months.  Weaker dollar is good for bitcoin  Bitcoin, gold and other cryptocurrencies and precious metals have historically done well when investors bet that the value of big government-backed currencies will fall.  "There is a new consensus building about dollar weakness," Veitmane said. "Bitcoin and gold may continue to do well as safe haven investments."  Djie agreed. "Gold and bitcoin have become prominent alternatives for retail investors looking to safeguard their wealth."  Investors considering bitcoin as a long-term investment should probably think of bitcoin much like gold. It could be a small part of a portfolio but not something investors should go overboard with, especially given the volatility of the cryptocurrency.  After all, bitcoin prices are still more than 50% below the all-time high of nearly $20,000 that they hit in December 2017 -- even though they've nearly tripled from a recent low of about $3,200 in December 2018.  Big Tech and Wall Street embracing crypto  Square SQ Facebook FB Bitcoin investing has become more mainstream thanks to cryptocurrency initiatives by big tech companies likeand  "The backing from Square and Facebook are definitely very significant to the overall crypto industry as it validates distributed technologies and the overall digital assets and cryptocurrency space," Djie said. "The embrace of crypto by these companies can allow mainstream users to enjoy the versatility and agility of the technology."  Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME The rise of futures trading for bitcoin on themay also help validate bitcoin with larger mutual funds, hedge funds and pensions.  U.S. Global Investors GROW "Among the biggest contributors to the rally, as I see it, is the hope that 2020 could finally see institutional investors move into the digital field en masse, prompted by growing client demand and more attractive ways to get exposure than direct ownership of coins," said Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of, in a recent blog post  But Holmes conceded that the Securities and Exchange Commission could provide the biggest boost for bitcoin if it ever approves a crypto-backed exchange-traded fund. The SEC has rejected numerous proposals so far.  "It's no exaggeration to say that a bitcoin ETF is highly anticipated," Holmes wrote.
2020-02-01	Erin Clark/The Boston Globe/Getty Images  The eighth case of coronavirus confirmed in the US is a student at University of Massachusetts Boston, public health officials in Massachusetts said during a call with reporters today. The man had recently returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.  The case poses no increased risk to other students on the university’s campus, said Dr. Jennifer Lo, medical director of the Boston Public Health Commission.  “He was very appropriate in seeking medical attention. He did not participate in any university activities from the time he arrived in the United States to his home,” Lo said.  She added that the student, a man in his 20s, is currently “doing quite well” and is being quarantined at his home, which is not in a dorm on campus. He is being monitored by public health nurses who are calling him regularly.  “We won’t release him from isolation until we are satisfied it’s safe to do so,” said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences.  “He returned to Boston directly from China through Logan Airport. He returned on the 28th of January, recognized quickly that he was ill and sought medical attention. He had only been ill for a brief period of time when he arrived,” Madoff said. “Active screening had not yet begun at Logan at that time.”  The patient had a runny nose when he arrived in Boston, health officials said, and has been in isolation since he sought medical care on Jan. 29. Madoff said he could count the patient’s close contacts “on our fingers,” and contacts are household members and medical personnel who treated the man.  All public health officials on the call emphasized that the overall risk to residents in Massachusetts remains low.
2020-02-02	Hong Kong (CNN Business) Chinese stocks recorded their worst day in years as investors finally got a chance to react to the worsening coronavirus outbreak .  Theplummeted 7.7% and the Shenzhen Component Index fell nearly 8.5% on their first day of trading after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. They had been closed since January 24.  The losses wiped out a combined $445 billion in market value.  China's currency also fell. The yuan sank 1.6% in onshore trading, dropping below seven to one US dollar in its first day back from the holiday break. The yuan also weakened below the seven mark offshore, where it moves more freely and has been trading since last week.  While global markets have had several days to weigh the rapid spread of the coronavirus, this is the first chance that mainland China has had to react in more than a week. Before the holiday, the number of cases numbered roughly 800 — now, there are more than 17,000.  Markets were originally due to reopen last Friday, but the Chinese government extended the holiday as it worked to control the outbreak.  Pumping money into the market  Authorities knew Monday's shock was likely inevitable. The People's Bank of China said Sunday that it would inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the Chinese markets by buying short term bonds to shore up banks' ability to lend money. The measure will help maintain "reasonably ample liquidity" in the banking system and keep currency markets stable, the central bank said.  The net amount of liquidity being injected into the markets is much lower. According to Reuters calculations using central bank data, more than 1 trillion yuan worth of other short-term bond agreements will mature Monday. That brings the net amount of cash flooding into the markets down to 150 billion yuan ($22 billion).  The central bank will also keep in contact with financial institutions and markets to determine what other policy responses may be necessary, according to Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the central bank.  Protecting China's financial markets and economy is a top priority for the government, which is also bracing for a potentially severe hit to first quarter economic growth. Economists have said that China's growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter — a decline that could mean $62 billion in lost growth.  Along with Monday's liquidity kick, top financial and economic regulators have announced dozens of other measures to stabilize the situation.  For example, the National Development and Reform Commission — the country's top economic planning agency — said Monday the government would "go to all lengths" to make sure that people have what they need to live, including food and other necessities. It also encouraged companies "that are key to control and prevent the virus" or are "of vital importance to the national economy" to resume production as soon as they can.  And the People's Bank of China said Saturday that it would provide money at low interest rates to commercial banks so that those banks could offer cheap loans to companies that make clinical masks, virus testing kits and other types of medical supplies. The central government will also subsidize those special loans.  The country's stock exchange regulators have also said they would allow companies to delay 2019 annual reports and 2020 quarterly earnings reports if they are affected by the disruption.  Other markets react  Markets elsewhere in Asia were mostly lower Monday, too — though their losses were not nearly as dramatic as in China.  Nikkei 225 N225 Kospi KOSPI closed down a fraction of a percent. In Japan, where 20 cases of the virus have been confirmed, thefell 1%. In South Korea, which has 15 confirmed cases, the benchmarkclosed down a fraction of a percent.  Hang Seng Index HSI Hong Kong's, meanwhile, closed up 0.2% after moving between small gains and losses. The index lost more than 6% last week after investors returned from the Lunar New Year holiday. Unlike in mainland China, Hong Kong markets reopened last Wednesday.  Dow INDU S&P 500 SPX Nasdaq Composite COMP higher during Asian trading hours. In the United States, stock futures were actually higher overnight.andfutures were all roughly 0.5% to 0.8%higher during Asian trading hours.
2020-02-02	Canadian officials have fielded 325 requests for departure assistance from Hubei Province in China due to the coronavirus, Global Affairs Canada said Sunday in a statement.  Canada is attempting to charter a plane to take Canadians from Wuhan, China, back to Canada, the statement said. Hubei is the epicenter of the outbreak  There are currently 543 Canadians in Hubei who have registered with the voluntary Registration of Canadians Abroad service. There are currently 15,219 Canadians in China (including Hong Kong) who have registered with the voluntary service.  Since registration is voluntary, this number is not a complete picture of Canadians in the region or in China, the statement said.  Only Canadian citizens who have entered China with a Canadian passport will be allowed to board the plane back to Canada, Global Affairs Canada said. Canadian citizens will need to have a valid Canadian passport and a valid Chinese visa to board the plane.  Canadians who appear to have symptoms will not be able to board, according to Global Affairs Canada.

2020-02-03	The first US patient to have a confirmed case of Wuhan coronavirus, a man in his 30s, has been discharged from the  Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington. Olivia Vanni/The Herald/AP  Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, the hospital said Monday in a statement.  “The patient remains in isolation at home and is being monitored by the Snohomish Health District, in coordination with his care team at Providence,” the statement said. “For the privacy of the patient, we will not be disclosing the exact date of discharge or any additional details regarding his discharge process.”  The patient issued the following statement: “I am at home and continuing to get better. I ask that the media please respect my privacy and my desire not to be in the public eye.  "I would like to thank the doctors, nurses, and entire team at Providence who cared for me. I appreciate all of the concern expressed by members of the public, and I look forward to returning to my normal life," the patient said.  There are now at least 11 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. Six cases have been confirmed in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona and two in Illinois. There have been two instances of person-to-person transmission – one in Illinois and one in California.
2020-02-03	Hong Kong (CNN) In a matter of weeks, the number of Wuhan coronavirus deaths in mainland China has overtaken the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the country, as Beijing injected billions of dollars into an economy hit by effective shutdowns to major cities.  Since its outbreak in December, more than 360 people have died of the disease in China, the country's health authorities said Monday. The total number of cases in mainland China stood at 17,205 as of Sunday evening, an increase of over 2,800 on the previous day, or almost 20%.  The 2003 outbreak of SARS -- another coronavirus strand -- infected 5,327 people in mainland China, with 349 deaths. There were 8,098 confirmed cases of SARS worldwide from November 2002 to July 2003, with 774 deaths globally.  The first death from the virus outside China was confirmed over the weekend . Philippine health officials said that a 44-year-old Chinese man died Saturday after flying into the country from Wuhan.  So far, more than 180 cases have been reported outside of China -- the majority of them with a direct link to the country -- across more than 25 countries and territories worldwide. Many countries have begun closing their borders to visitors from China, with major airlines canceling flights to and from the country.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday announced new border closures over the Wuhan virus, amid intense public pressure to stop anyone crossing into the city from mainland China. Lam said further measures were being taken "to ensure the control of the boundary control points to reduce people movement across the border," but fell short of a complete sealing off of the city.  Germany confirmed its 10th case on Sunday, and there were also new cases reported in South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Macao and Hong Kong. The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all announced that they will not allow foreign nationals who have traveled from or transited through China to enter. Nationals from those countries will face mandatory quarantine on arrival.  The G7 nations will hold a joint telephone conference to discuss how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, German Health Minister Jens Spahn announced after talking with his American counterpart Alex Azar on Sunday.  Economic pain  In China, Monday is supposed to be the first day back at work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday ended on February 2.  However much of the country will not be returning, with multiple local authorities extending the break in an attempt to avoid further spread of the virus. Hubei, the central Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital, will lengthen its holiday by an "appropriate extent," authorities said Saturday , while Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and the manufacturing provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang will also reportedly remain on holiday until at least next week.  With much of China's economic heartland still closed, concerns are growing over the impact to the Chinese economy. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets -- which have been closed since January 24 -- plunged by around 10% on opening Monday.  The People's Bank of China said Sunday it would inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the Chinese markets in order to ensure "reasonably ample liquidity" in the banking system and keep currency markets stable.  The net amount of liquidity being injected into the markets will be much lower, however. According to Reuters calculations using central bank data, more than 1 trillion yuan worth of other short-term bond sales will mature Monday. That brings the net amount of cash flooding into the markets down to 150 billion yuan ($21.4 billion).  State news agency Xinhua on Monday published a defiant commentary headlined "Chinese economy resilient enough to counter virus shock."  "The epidemic will eventually come to an end, just like the winter will fade away. The negative implications of the virus on the Chinese economy will be short-lived, and the economic fundamentals are solid enough to withstand its blow," Xinhua said. "Doomsayers take this chance to hype again the China-collapse theory. But seasoned observers disagree."  It quoted a former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank saying that while the economic impact in the first quarter will likely be big, perhaps driving nationwide annual growth down a percentage point, "it will be substantially offset by above-the-trend growth in the rest of the year if the epidemic can be contained soon."  Fight to control the virus  In Wuhan itself, the epicenter of the virus outbreak where most of the deaths have been reported, there was a glimmer of hope Monday, as the first of two purpose-built hospitals opened for business.  The hospitals , built in about a week by thousands of workers on round-the-clock shifts and based on a similar plan used during the 2003 SARS outbreak, will be run by People's Liberation Army medical personnel.  They will add thousands of extra beds to Wuhan's extremely strained medical system. Thousands of health workers, including PLA medics, have also been dispatched to help out in ordinary hospitals in the city and other parts of Hubei.  But while Wuhan should be seeing some additional capacity Monday, Hong Kong will be seeing the opposite. Health care workers in the semi-autonomous Chinese city began a five-day strike on Monday over what they see as the failure of the city's government to fully shut the border with China. They are demanding a full border closure and greater support from the government.  In announcing the new border closures, Lam said further measures were being taken "to ensure the control of the boundary control points to reduce people movement across the border," but fell short of completely sealing off the city.  Lam said the main land borders at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau would shut as of midnight tonight, as would the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal.  That will leave all but three border crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China closed. Those which remain open are the city's international airport, the Shenzhen Bay border and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge.  There is widespread fear in Hong Kong -- where 15 coronavirus cases have been confirmed so far -- of a repeat of SARS, which infected more than 1,700 people and killed 286 in 2003.  Most front line medical workers will not strike, their unions said, in order to continue serving the public, but backroom and support staff will walk out.  Studying infection  Many countries have begun evacuating their citizens out of the worst hit areas of Hubei, while other nations, in addition to closing their borders to all visitors from China, are ordering mandatory quarantines of nationals returning home.  Major airlines -- including British Airways, American Airlines, Air Canada and Lufthansa -- have canceled or slashed routes to China for the foreseeable future.  Much of the concern is driven by the lack of a confirmed cure or treatment protocol for the virus, which appears to be far more contagious -- though not as deadly -- as SARS. About 10% of SARS cases resulted in death, while the toll from Wuhan coronavirus cases stands at about 2%.  On Sunday, doctors in Thailand said they had successfully treated one Wuhan coronavirus patient with a combination of antiviral drugs.  Dr. Kriangsak Atipornwanich, a doctor at Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok, said at a Ministry of Health news conference that he had treated a 71-year-old woman patient from China with a combination of drugs used in HIV and flu treatments. He said the patient had previously been treated only with anti-HIV drugs.  Officials at the news conference said the latest lab test showed there was no trace of the virus in the patient's respiratory system.  Hospitals in Beijing have previously reported using HIV drugs to treat coronavirus patients, though it is unclear if they have been successful.  With some apparent good news came another worrying development, however. Scientists in China discovered over the weekend that fecal samples from patients infected with the Wuhan coronavirus tested positive for the pathogen.  This means it is highly possible the virus can exist in and spread through contaminated fecal matter. Previously it had been thought the virus mainly spread through droplets emitted when a person coughs or sneezes, or through other direct contact.
2020-02-03	Hong Kong (CNN Business) China Eastern has become the first major Chinese carrier to suspend flights to and from the United States because of the escalating Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.  The virus has killed 361 people and sickened more than 17,000 in China so far, with nearly 180 cases confirmed in countries such as the United States , Germany and Japan. One man has died in the Philippines.  Due to "the recent public health incident," China Eastern is canceling flights from Shanghai (PVG) to Los Angeles and New York (JFK) from February 2 through February 10, according to a notice circulated to travel agents and seen by CNN Business. Flights to the major US hubs were unavailable to book on China Eastern's website until March 29, however.  China Eastern CEA did not respond to a request for comment.  China Eastern is also canceling flights from Shanghai (PVG) to San Francisco on February 6 and February 9, to Chicago on February 8 and to Honolulu from February 3 until March 27, according to the notice.

2020-02-04	The US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has issued an emergency use authorization to allow qualified labs to use the Wuhan coronavirus test developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previously, the CDC was the only lab in the United States able to test for the novel coronavirus.  The diagnostic is authorized to be used for patients who meet CDC criteria for testing, and by qualified labs designated by the CDC or certified to perform high-complexity tests.  The test can detect Wuhan coronavirus from nasal or oral swabs.  As of Monday, the CDC had 260 patients under investigation for the virus -- 11 had tested positive, 167 negative and 82 were still pending.  There are 11 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. Six cases have been confirmed in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona and two in Illinois.  Negative results do not preclude infection with the virus, the FDA noted in a press release, adding that negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history and epidemiological information.  "Since this outbreak first emerged, we've been working closely with our partners across the US government and around the globe to expedite the development and availability of critical medical products to help end this outbreak as quickly as possible. This continues to be an evolving situation and the ability to distribute this diagnostic test to qualified labs is a critical step forward in protecting the public health," FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.  The US Department of Health and Human Services on Friday declared the novel coronavirus to be a public health emergency in the United States.
2020-02-05	London (CNN Business) The arteries of global trade are clogging up.  Shipping companies that carry goods from China to the rest of the world say they are reducing the number of seaborne vessels, as measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus crimp demand for their services and threaten to disrupt global supply chains.  About 80% of world goods trade by volume is carried by sea and China is home to seven of the world's 10 busiest container ports, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Nearby Singapore and South Korea each have a mega port too.  "A closure of the world's manufacturing hub impacts container shipping at large, as it is a vital facilitator of the intra-Asian and global supply chains," said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at BIMCO, an international shipping association. "This will affect many industries and limit demand for containerized goods transport," Sand told CNN Business.  Everything from cars and machinery to apparel and other consumer staples are shipped in containers, and disruption to the industry could reverberate far beyond China as the country seeks to contain the coronavirus outbreak by keeping factories shut and workers at home.

2020-02-05	(CNN) Nearly two decades after he was treated, former severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient Alex Lam is still haunted by his experience.  "(It is) painful hearing the news again. SARS is coming back, the deadly virus is coming back," he said. SARS , of course, has not returned, but a new type of deadly virus from the same family is sweeping China, opening old wounds for some.  In 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people, and killed 774. Asia was hardest hit, with Hong Kong recording almost 300 deaths. Lam was treated in an isolation ward for three weeks, and considered one of the lucky ones because he was discharged with no further complications.  "I was put in a big room with many other patients," he recalled. "I heard some coughing at night, crying, and that's really sad."  The novel coronavirus , which has now spread to at least 27 territories outside mainland China, is already bigger in numbers -- at least 28,000 people have been infected worldwide and more than 560 have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern , prompting countries to take unprecedented measures.  John Nicholls, clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), said the SARS outbreak was brought to an end in July 2003 by good hygiene practices -- such as frequent hand-washing -- and environmental factors such as high temperature and humidity in the summer months.  "That will be the same for this one," he said. "My feeling is that this is just going to be like SARS and the world is going to get basically a very bad cold for about five months."  People wearing face masks as a preventative measure following a coronavirus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, line up to purchase face masks in Hong Kong on February 5, 2020.  Containment  ordered a To stop the virus spreading further, China hasordered a lockdown on the movement of millions of people, which has seen flights, trains and buses canceled in all major cities of Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first reported. School in Hong Kong and Macao -- semi-autonomous Chinese cities that operate their own education systems -- is suspended until at least March  Some countries, such as South Korea and the Philippines, have closed their borders to visitors arriving from mainland China. Others have also issued travel warnings and evacuated citizens in Wuhan.  Despite the drastic measures, some virology experts believe containing the current outbreak might prove to be more difficult than it was to stem SARS.  John Nicholls, clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout.  Nicholls said one problem could be that the new virus appeared to have greater transmissibility than SARS, due the possibility that cases can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients.  The WHO, however, has said that "the main driver of transmission ... is symptomatic cases." The organization said that it was "aware of possible transmission" from asymptomatic individuals in a few instances but believed this to be rare and not a major player in the spread of the virus.  Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical firm with an experimental drug called remdesivir that is used to treat the Ebola virus, is working with Chinese health authorities to see if the medication can combat the symptoms of coronavirus.  Understanding the virus  In January, Nicholls and his team became the first scientists outside mainland China to reproduce the virus in a laboratory. They have since been studying it to understand how the coronavirus interacts with human tissue around the body, and evaluate the test that diagnoses patients.  Malik Peiris, a public health virologist at HKU who advises the WHO, said one optimistic sign was that the novel coronavirus appeared to have a lower fatality rate than SARS. On Tuesday, China's National Health Commission said the death rate was 2.1% nationwide, while SARS had a global ratio of 9.6% , according to the WHO.  Malik Peiris, a public health virologist at the University of Hong Kong and WHO adviser.  "The case fatality rate doesn't count the milder cases that don't come to medical attention -- and there does seem to be quite a number of those," Peiris said. "Hopefully, the severity of the disease is much lower than what we believe or what is apparent at the moment, and so the overall outcome may not be as dire as what some people think at this point in time."  Other medical scholars have given different predictions on how long the outbreak may last.  Zhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the virus to peak as quickly as the coming weekend  Gabriel Leung, HKU's chair professor of public health medicine, was less optimistic and estimated the number of cases to peak around mid-April or mid-May.  The new normal?  Another scenario is that the new coronavirus could become a common global illness, like influenza. That outcome would not be without precedent. H1N1 -- a strain of flu responsible for the 2009 flu pandemic has now become a seasonal virus.  "The common cold is caused by two different types of coronaviruses," Peiris said.  For Lam, the former SARS patient, that scenario would be a failure. He is now the head of Hong Kong SARS Mutual Help Association -- a group of SARS survivors which is calling on the Hong Kong government to take tougher measures to end the outbreak.  "We hope that the government can do something more drastic ... because most parts of China are considered high risk," he said.  Lam also called for unity.  "To fight against contagious disease, we must stand together. We must not panic," he added. "We need to think positive, because one day, the disease will go away."

2020-02-06	Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang. From Li Wenliang  Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower doctor who was reprimanded by Wuhan Police after warning the public of a potential "SARS-like" disease in December 2019, died of coronavirus in Wuhan in the early hours of Friday morning (local time), according to a statement from Wuhan Central Hospital.  “Our hospital's ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected with coronavirus during his work in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic,” the statement read. “He died at 2:58 a.m. on Feb 7 after attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful.”  The statement came after hours of confusion over Li’s status.  Earlier on Thursday, several state media outlets reported Li’s death, following Chinese social media erupting into profound grief and anger. A short time later, Wuhan Central Hospital released a statement saying Li was still alive and in critical condition, adding that they were “making attempts to resuscitate him.” State media subsequently deleted their previous tweets.  About Li: After he alerted colleagues in December, Li was questioned by local health authorities and was later summoned by Wuhan police to sign a reprimand letter in which he was accused of "spreading rumors online" and "severely disrupting social order."  Li was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560. He later contracted the virus himself.  Li was hospitalized on Jan. 12 and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 1.  CNN gives an update from Beijing:
2020-02-06	Hong Kong/London (CNN Business) For decades, China was the promised land for American, European and Japanese carmakers. Now, the coronavirus outbreak threatens to prolong a slump in vehicle sales , derail production in the country and snarl global auto supply chains .  andare among the global carmakers who have invested heavily in China, forming partnerships with local companies and building vast factories. China makes more cars than any other country, and is also the world's biggest market.  When car plants across China shut last month for the Lunar New Year holiday, the industry was already under huge pressure : sales had been falling for two years due to the loss of tax incentives for electric cars and the slowing economy , and officials were expecting an unprecedented third year of stagnation.  Many of those plants have since been ordered to remain shut at least until next week as the Chinese government scrambles to contain the virus that first appeared in Wuhan, a major autos hub, before sweeping across the country, infecting thousands of people and killing hundreds. Automakers are bracing for even longer shutdowns and a deeper recession in global sales.  Sales and production to suffer  Close to 60 million people are still living under lockdown in China, with three cities reporting over a thousand confirmed coronavirus cases each. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread, keeping huge numbers of potential shoppers at home until the outbreak peaks.  "We assume consumers will tend to avoid purchasing cars in dealer shops until then to reduce contagion risk," analysts at S&P Global Ratings said in a report published Wednesday.  An assembly line at the Dongfeng Honda plant in Wuhan, China.  The extended factory closures are expected to make it much more difficult for the industry to emerge from its recession. According to S&P Global Ratings, the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter.  Nissan NSANF PSA Group PUGOY The auto industry is particularly exposed because the virus originated in one of China's "motor cities." General Motors,, Renault, Honda and Peugeot owner all have large factories in Wuhan , which has been on lockdown since late January.  Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province account for 9% of total Chinese auto production, according to S&P Global Ratings. PSA Group told CNN Business this week that its Wuhan plant would remain closed until at least February 14, though a spokesperson added that its European operations have not yet been affected by any parts or logistical disruptions.  Other carmakers are also trying to assess the fallout from the outbreak and keep it to a minimum.  "It's a very fluid situation," GM CEO Mary Barra told investors Wednesday during an earnings presentation. She said the company is working with its Chinese partners and local health authorities to make sure the supply chain is not disrupted.  The situation varies depending on the plant and its supply of parts ... so we cannot definitively say whether we will restart plant operations from February 17." Toyota spokesperson  Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen have said they expect to resume some vehicle production in China on Monday, though both firms added that they continue to monitor the situation and will adjust plans as needed.  Volkswagen is most exposed to potential damage. The world's largest automaker has 24 plants making cars or parts in China, accounting for 40% of its production.  On Wednesday, Volkswagen said that its supply chain "is on track to be fully functional in time for the start of production," and that planned deliveries to customers haven't changed.  Toyota, which makes 15% of its cars in China but is less exposed than Japanese rival Honda, is also worried. The world's second biggest carmaker had been hoping to restart production on February 10, but it has been forced to keep its 12 joint venture plants in China — four making cars and eight making parts or components — closed for another week at least.  "The situation varies depending on the plant and its supply of parts. Also, there are additional considerations that must be given to the guidelines from local and region governments, including things like logistics, so we cannot definitively say whether we will restart plant operations from February 17," a Toyota spokesperson said.  The situation could get worse before it gets better. S&P Global Ratings researchers said the Chinese government could extend factory shutdowns in order to limit contagion risk, affecting as much as half of China's car and auto parts production. Car plants in cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin — many hundreds of miles away from Wuhan — could be out of commission for an "extended" period, they warned.  The risks beyond China  The longer the crisis drags on, the greater the chance that global auto supply chains will be damaged.  German engineering firm Bosch, which is the world's largest auto component manufacturer, has dozens of plants in China including two in Wuhan. Other parts suppliers including Schaeffler, ZF Friedrichshafen, Faurecia and Valeo have significant operations in the country, according to S&P Global Ratings.  A spokesperson for Bosch said Thursday that its plants in China remain closed on government orders, but production is expected to resume at many locations "within the next few days." The spokesperson said it was still too early to assess the impact to the company.  Tesla TSLA China is also the global manufacturing base for electric motors, transmissions, and other components for electric cars., which sources parts from multiple companies in China, has already said that production will be delayed at its new factory in Shanghai.  Hyundai HYMTF Crunch time has arrived for one major carmaker.suspended production this week at its plants in South Korea because the coronavirus disrupted its supply of parts.  Korea's car sector sources 29% of its parts from China, according to Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics. He said that Hyundai's decision underscores how valuable China is to major manufacturing supply chains around the world.  "Even industries that appear to have low exposure to Chinese suppliers will almost certainly contain firms that are heavily reliant on inputs from China," MacAdam wrote Wednesday in a research note. "It only takes bottlenecks in the production of one low-value, but crucial, component to bring higher-value, downstream production to a halt.  — Laura He, Sherisse Pham, Chris Isidore and Enjoji Kaori contributed to this report.
2020-02-06	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) It's now about two months since a deadly novel coronavirus was found in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and nearly every country and territory in East Asia has confirmed a case.  One of the world's poorest countries has, according to its public statements, managed to avoid the virus despite the fact that in neighboring mainland China, it has killed more than 600 people and infected more than 31,000.  More than 300 people have tested positive for the virus in over 25 places around the world -- including the other two countries that share a land border with North Korea, Russia and South Korea.  In fact, every country and territory within a 1,500-mile radius of North Korea, except for sparsely populated Mongolia, has confirmed a case.  It's unclear how North Korea has been able to avoid the virus. Pyongyang has either been very lucky, isn't saying something or is reaping one of the few benefits of being a so-called "hermit nation."  The country has not publicly acknowledged any confirmed coronavirus patients, but Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University who previously served as the head of a think tank operated by South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), said it's very possible someone inside North Korea -- a country of 25 million people -- has been infected.  Researchers are still trying to determine how the virus spreads, but it is not believed to be airborne. It's also unclear if the virus can spread via feces or if infected patients without symptoms can pass it on to others.  But Nam suspects a Chinese patient could have infected someone from North Korea across their shared border.  "We know that the Chinese regions close to the North Korean border, such as Dandong and Shenyang, have confirmed patients. About 90% of North Korean trade is with China and we know so many people, trucks and trains passed through the border between the two nations before North Korea installed recent regulations" to stop the virus from getting into the country, Nam told CNN.  Despite not publicly acknowledging any confirmed or even suspected cases, North Korea has been uncharacteristically transparent regarding its efforts to combat the virus. It appears the country is taking the epidemic very seriously, according to reports in state-run news service KCNA.  Quarantine staff in protective gear are pictured at Pyongyang International Airport on Saturday.  North Korea has closed its borders to all foreign tourists, most of whom are Chinese, as a precautionary measure, according to one travel agency that runs tours inside the country. Pyongyang did the same during the Ebola outbreak of 2014.  On January 30, state news agency KCNA reported that authorities had declared a "state emergency," and that anti-epidemic headquarters were being established around the country. On Monday, KCNA said all people who entered the country after January 13 were put under "medical supervision."  KCNA also reported North Korean health officials had set up a "nationwide test sample transport system" and had the ability to promptly diagnose suspicious cases.  However, several experts who spoke to CNN were skeptical Pyongyang's purported testing ability. And given the country's intense secrecy it's unlikely the world will ever know if any of the measures North Korea has taken will actually work.  Medical workers screen the temperatures of foreign nationals using thermal imaging devices in the diplomatic area of Pyongyang on Monday.  North Korea is considered one of the world's most reclusive and secretive states, and information about everything from its top leadership under leader Kim Jong Un to daily life outside the capital of Pyongyang is notoriously hard to come by.  While most countries announce senior government appointments, like a new foreign minister, North Korea often does not -- and experts are often required to sleuth through state media and external sources for clues.  The country's healthcare sector, historically, is no different. North Korea has never formally acknowledged how many died during its devastating 1990s famine. Experts estimate as many as 2 million people may have been killed, and those who fled the country at the time shared horrific stories of death and survival  "North Korea has such a limited supply of basic medicine that public health officials need to focus on preventative medicine. They would be ill-equipped to deal with any kind of epidemic," said Jean Lee, the director off the Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center.  Doctors who have defected in recent years often speak of poor working conditions and shortages of everything from medicine to basic healthcare supplies.  Choi Jung-hun, a former physician in North Korea who fled the country in 2011, said when he was helping to combat a measles outbreak in 2006 to 2007, North Korea did not have the resources to operate round-the-clock quarantine and isolation facilities.  He recalled that after identifying suspicious cases, manuals for doctors said patients were supposed to be transferred to a hospital or a quarantine facility for monitoring.  "The problem in North Korea is that manuals are not followed. When there wasn't enough food provided for the people at hospitals and quarantine facilities, people escaped to look for food," Choi said.  JUST WATCHED How close are China and North Korea?

MUST WATCH How close are China and North Korea? 02:08  A health crisis, but a political opportunity  Lee, who previously worked for The Associated Press and opened the newswire's bureau in Pyongyang, also said the epidemic may serve multiple political purposes for the Kim regime, including giving him time to plan his next steps in nuclear negotiations with the United States, which have been on the rocks for months.  "We're seeing the North Koreans use coronavirus as an opportunity to retreat into self-imposed isolation at a time of political uncertainty," said Lee. "Kim Jong Un needed to buy some time to recalibrate his internal and external strategy and messaging on nuclear negotiations."  The virus also gives Pyongyang a new excuse to further tighten its borders and justify the draconian social restrictions most North Korean people live under, Lee said. North Koreans can be severely punished for criticizing the Kim family and the ruling regime. Most cannot access the internet or any information from the outside world that has not been approved by state censors.  The majority of North Koreans also do not enjoy freedom of movement and are required to receive government permission to travel to other provinces. Very few are permitted to travel abroad.  North Koreans ride boats in Yalu River, the border river shared with China, in Qingcheng, North Korea as seen from across the border on April 29, 2019, in Dandong, China.  For those that can move, transport is very difficult. North Korea is not completely connected by roads, and most of the public relies on a highly dysfunctional and derelict railway system. Short journeys of a few hundred miles can take hours or even days.  Clamping down on its borders could have an unintended economic effect. North Korea's economy is heavily reliant on trade with China, as most other countries will not trade with Pyongyang due to international sanctions.  Closing the border could shut the country off from its economic lifeline, said Evans Revere, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific and current senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group.  "The need to seal off the borders will have a devastating economic effect on North Korea. Because of international sanctions, US pressure, and the absence of any significant aid coming in from the ROK (South Korea), North Korea has become even more dependent on China," Revere said in an email. "With the border shut down, Pyongyang is probably panicking right now."  But those travel restrictions and challenges also provide something of a benefit from a public health standpoint.  "North Korea has the best control system in the world," said Choi, the doctor who defected.  "North Korea probably is best at limiting social contacts and regional traveling because they've been practicing that for 70 years. The difference now is making the regulations even tighter. So this system will be helpful for them to prevent any virus from spreading wider."  A previous version of this story misstated Nam Sung-wook's previous job. This has been corrected.

2020-02-07	None of the evacuees from China who arrived at San Antonio’s Lackland Air Force Base are sick, according to an official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The passengers were men, women and children and had either been living in, or traveled to, Hubei province. They were escorted off the plane, at which time medical professionals took their temperatures. Some of the passengers were then loaded back onto the plane and will continue on to Omaha, Nebraska. Fewer than 100 of the passengers will be kept at the air force base.  All the evacuees will be under federal quarantined for 14 days from the time the plane left China.  “It may seem surprising to some that we are taking such aggressive measures,” CDC's Capt. Jennifer McQuiston said at a news conference Friday.  McQuiston added that the goal of the CDC is to protect the health of US citizens.
2020-02-08	London (CNN Business) Nearly two decades have passed since a coronavirus known as SARS emerged in China, killing hundreds of people and sparking panic that sent a chill through the global economy. The virus now rampaging across China could be much more damaging .  China has become an indispensable part of global business since the 2003 SARS outbreak. It's grown into the world's factory, churning out products such as the iPhone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper. The country also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products tourism and cars . China's economy accounted for roughly 4% of world GDP in 2003; it now makes up 16% of global output.  SARS sickened 8,098 people and killed 774 before it was contained. The new coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has already killed more than 900 people and infected over 40,000 across at least 25countries and territories. Chinese officials have locked down Wuhan and several other cities, but the virus continues to spread.  "The outbreak has the potential to cause severe economic and market dislocation. But the scale of the impact will ultimately be determined by how the virus spreads and evolves, which is almost impossible to predict, as well as how governments respond," said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.  Compounding the risk is the fact that the world outside China has also changed since 2003.  Globalization has encouraged companies to build supply chains that cut across national borders, making economies much more interconnected. The major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis, and global debt levels have never been higher. Rising nationalism may make it harder to coordinate a worldwide response, if that's required.  A resident wears a protective mask while riding a scooter on February 5, 2020, in Wuhan.  The virus is snarling supply chains and disrupting companies.  Volkswagen VLKAF Toyota TM Daimler DDAIF General Motors GM Renault RNLSY Honda HMC Hyundai HYMTF Car plants across China have been ordered to remain closed following the Lunar New Year holiday, preventing global automakersandfrom resuming operations in the world's largest car market. According to S&P Global Ratings, the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter. Toyota said on Friday it would keep its factories shut at least until February 17.  Burberry BBRYF Luxury goods makers, which rely on Chinese consumers who spend big at home and while on vacation, have also been hit. British brandhas closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China, and its chief executive warned Friday that the virus is causing a "material negative effect on luxury demand." Dozens of global airlines have curtailed flights to and from China.  Qualcomm QCOM Hyundai HYMTF Fiat Chrysler FCAU Even more troubling is the threat to global supply chains., the world's biggest maker of smartphone chips, warned that the outbreak was causing "significant" uncertainty around demand for smartphones, and the supplies needed to produce them. Already, auto parts shortages have forcedto close plants in South Korea and causedto make contingency plans to avoid the same result at one of its plants in Europe.  Economists say the current level of disruption is manageable. If the number of new coronavirus cases begins to slow, and China's factories reopen soon, the result will be a fleeting hit to the Chinese economy in the first quarter and a dent in global growth. If the virus continues to spread, however, the economic damage will increase rapidly.  An employee works on an assembly line at Dongfeng Honda in Wuhan.  Allianz ALIZF Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to, told CNN Business that he was most worried about the potential cascading economic effects.  "They first paralyze the region of the virus outbreak," he said. "Then they gradually spread domestically, undermining internal trade, consumption, production and the movement of people. If the virus is still not contained, the process spreads further, including regionally and internationally by disrupting trade, supply chains and travel."  Epidemic risk  Economists have a hard time working out the potential costs of epidemics because of their unique characteristics.  Yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami, or other unpredictable events known as "black swans." According to a study by the World Bank, a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion. Losses from a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 virus, can still wipe 0.5% off global GDP.  "A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact," the World Bank assessed in a report on pandemics from 2013. (The Wuhan coronavirus has not been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.)  The virus is not the driving factor behind those losses, however. Instead, it's the way consumers, businesses and governments respond to an outbreak that matters most.  People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick, preventing them from traveling, shopping and working. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production.  "This is continuing to grow in scope and magnitude. It could end being really, really big, and really, really serious. We can't project that now," said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who spent 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council.  According to Shearing, past epidemics show that China's economy is likely to take a significant hit in the first quarter. But that will quickly fade from memory if the virus is contained.  "As long as factory closures don't lead to job losses, by this time next year the level of GDP is unlikely to be very different from what it would have been without the virus," he said.  What can be done?  China's government has moved quickly to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the measures taken to contain it.  The People's Bank of China cut a key interest rate this week and injected huge amounts of cash into markets in order to help take the pressure off banks and borrowers. Officials have also announced new tax breaks and subsidies designed to help consumers.  Yet China is also more vulnerable to a crisis than it was 17 years ago when SARS broke out.  "It has much higher debt, trade tensions with a major trading partner and its growth has been steadily slowing down for a number of years, which gives a weak starting point to face such a crisis," said Raphie Hayat, a senior economist at Dutch bank Rabobank.  Analysts at Capital Economics expect the government to announce additional measures in the coming days. If the virus keeps spreading, they believe that Beijing will have to abandon its long-running efforts to get its debt under control and pump money directly into the economy.  Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a meeting in Beijing.  Central banks in neighboring countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have cut interest rates in recent weeks. South Korea and Taiwan could be next.  But the big powers of the financial world are exhausted from a decade fighting anemic growth since the global financial crisis. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and hasn't been able to increase them since, while the Bank of Japan is in a similar position. The US Federal Reserve already cut interest rates three times last year; Chair Jerome Powell has said he's carefully monitoring the situation.  Meanwhile, debt levels have soared in the United States, Japan and key European countries including Italy, limiting the scope for a big fiscal stimulus if the world economy goes into another tailspin. Global debt, including borrowing by households, governments and companies, has jumped to more than three times the size of the global economy, the highest ratio on record, according to the Institute of International Finance.  Also critical is whether governments are able to coordinate their response to the outbreak, ideally with help from multinational institutions. This is especially true because, according to the World Bank, preparedness for a potential pandemic is low. But coordination may prove difficult in a increasingly fractured world where nationalism is often prized over cooperation.  "It's quite clear that multinational institutions are under more pressure, and have less teeth on day to day issues than 10 years ago," Shearing said. "But the optimist in me would like to think that in the face of a global pandemic, global institutions are still in a position to respond."  Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified Raphie Hayat's employer.
2020-02-08	An American couple was planning to finally pick up their adopted daughter in China this weekend. Now, the process is on hold due to novel coronavirus.  After two years of paperwork, Ivy and Noah Cleveland had a room, a crib and clothes ready to welcome 3-year-old Ruby into their Georgia home. But their adoption agency canceled the trip that would have finalized Ruby’s adoption.  “This was the first time in my life that I truly wept to the point of being sick in my body,” Ivy Cleveland told CNN. "I just laid over her bed, over her crib that I had prepared for her and look up at the pictures in the wall, and her clothes in her closet, understanding that this is not happening right now.”  Last month, the State Department issued the highest-level warning not to travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak and recommended that US citizens defer travel for adoption purposes.  “We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens defer travel to China for adoption purposes and that prospective adoptive parents contact their adoption service providers to discuss future plans,” the department said on January 31.  The Clevelands are unsure when they will able travel to China, but said they are not ready to give up their adoption process.  “I know this is just a part of our story, it’s part of Ruby’s story and how incredible will it be to tell her ‘look what we did to fight for you,’” Noah Cleveland said.
2020-02-09	In the span of about two hours, six more people were reported to have died from coronavirus.  China’s National Health Commission confirmed Sunday evening that the death toll in China is now 908. The global death toll is 910, with one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.  The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases is more than 40,000, with the vast majority in mainland China.
2020-02-09	New York (CNN Business) The human cost of China's coronavirus outbreak is tragic, mounting and already readily apparent. The cost to businesses around the world could also become severe in the coming weeks.  Manufacturers around the world have come to depend on parts from China to keep their own supply chains going. Experts fear that factories across the globe could ground to a halt if many of the plants across China remain closed this coming week.  Auto plants could be among the first to feel the impact. That's because of the massive size of the Chinese auto parts industry and the fact that you can't build a car with only 99% of its parts.  "It only takes one missing part to stop a line," said Mike Dunne, a consultant to the auto industry in Asia and the former head of GM's operations in Indonesia.  He said there have been many examples in the past where problems like a fire or natural disaster shutting a single supplier plant can affect auto plants around the world. This could be far worse depending on how widespread the shutdown of plants due to the virus becomes.  Read More
2020-02-09	Hong Kong (CNN) Millions of people across China are heading back to work after the Lunar New Year break turned into an extended quarantine due to the Wuhan coronavirus .  Many will be working from their homes, however, with strict quarantine guidelines in place in many cities and most businesses urging people to work remotely if possible to reduce the chances of transmission.  Some semblance of normality may have returned, but the outbreak shows no signs of slowing, with the number of confirmed cases now at over 40,000 worldwide and the death toll at 910.  That means the coronavirus has officially killed more people than the SARS pandemic of 2003, previously one of the worst medical crises in recent Chinese history.  A total of 3,281 patients infected with the coronavirus have since been discharged from hospital as of Sunday, Chinese health authorities said  The vast majority of the deaths have been in mainland China, leaving the country in something of a bizarre situation where some areas of it will be returning to something approaching business as usual, even as other regions face increasingly draconian restrictions on their movement and behavior in a desperate attempt to contain the virus.  A team of doctors and researchers from the World Health Organization left for China on Sunday to assist with the outbreak, led by Bruce Aylward, who the organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described as a "veteran of past public health emergencies." Aylward led the WHO's response to Ebola, as well as initiatives for immunization, communicable diseases control and polio eradication.  Even as the epicenter of the outbreak remains in Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital and accounts for almost 30,000 of the total confirmed cases, the epidemic has spread worldwide, affecting more than two dozen countries.  The largest outbreak outside of mainland China is on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in the Japanese city of Yokohama. On Monday, an additional 65 cases were confirmed aboard, bringing the total number of cases on the ship to 135 -- nearly doubling the previous total of 70 confirmed cases Sunday.  Japan has 160 total cases, including those aboard the cruise ship. Beyond Japan, Singapore has reported 40 cases, Hong Kong has 38 infections and one death, Thailand has confirmed 32 cases, and South Korea 27.  Cruise ship lockdown  Cruise liners have emerged as a major battleground in the attempt to halt the spread of the virus.  As well as the ship in Yokohama, two vessels in the US and Hong Kong had also been under quarantine, with passengers and crew tested for the virus.  Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas cruise ship, which has been docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, since returning on Friday, will be able to set sail Monday, however, after four passengers who were taken to hospital for further evaluation showed no signs of the virus.  All 3,600 people on board the World Dream ship in Hong Kong will also be able to disembark Monday, after five days under quarantine. Health authorities said that everyone on board had tested negative.  Passengers on board the Princess Cruises liner in Yokohama have not been so lucky. So far at least 135 passengers tested positive for the coronavirus, amid signs of a full blown outbreak on board, one of the largest outside of mainland China. Information from Princess Cruises and a CNN tally put the number of infected Americans on the ship at 24.  Those cruise passengers have been under strict quarantine for over a week now, confined to their cabins as medical personnel conduct tests on the 3,700 people on board.  Princess Cruises said it will offer a full refund to all passengers on board. The company's president, Jan Swartz, thanked passengers for their "perseverance and understanding."  "All monies paid to Princess Cruises including your cruise fare, round trip Princess Air, pre- or post-Cruise Plus hotels, transfers, prepaid shore excursions, gratuities and other items, and taxes, fees and port expenses will be refunded to the original form of payment," Swartz wrote.  Swartz said the company will "refund reasonable independent expenses," along with air travel, transfers or pre/post-cruise hotels. Each guest also will receive a 100% future cruise credit equal to the fare passengers paid for the quarantined voyage, Swartz wrote. That credit has to be applied by February 28, 2021.  "It is our sincere hope that the refund and credit will help ease at least a small bit of the stress you may be feeling right now," Swartz wrote in a letter to passengers.  Citizen journalist missing  There was outrage in China on Friday as news emerged of the death of Li Wenliang . A doctor in Wuhan, Li had attempted to warn friends of a new virus spreading, but was detained by police in the city for "rumormongering." He was later hailed as a whistleblower by both the public and state media, but was soon hospitalized with the virus.  Following Li's death, Chinese authorities struggled to control the narrative, especially as the censors appeared to be trying to massage the timing of the announcement , deleting posts announcing his passing. Hundreds of thousands of posted demands for free speech online, in a rare challenge to the authorities, who deleted posts left and right.  History appeared to be repeating itself over the weekend, as it emerged that citizen journalist Chen Qiushi had been missing for several days . Chen, who had been carrying out critical reporting from inside of Wuhan, went missing on Thursday evening, just as hundreds of thousands of people in China began demanding freedom of speech online.  Friends and family later found out from the police that he had been forced into quarantine. By Sunday, Chen's disappearance had started to gain traction on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, with many pleading for his release.  "Hope the government can treat Chen Qiushi in a fair and just way," one user wrote on Sunday morning. "We can no longer afford a second Li Wenliang!"  Tight censorship and control of the narrative in the early days of the outbreak has been blamed for aiding the spread of the virus from Wuhan to the rest of the country. Officials in the city downplayed the severity of the virus in public even as evidence was available that it was spreading from person-to-person.  Draconian controls  While some Chinese cities will be attempting to get back to normal -- or at least to business, with staff working from home -- others are introducing yet more stringent controls.  In a joint statement Saturday, China's National Health Commission, Supreme Court and Ministry of Public Security announced seven "medical-related crimes" that would be severely punished during the epidemic.  They include attacking medical personnel, refusing medical checks and damaging or destroying property at medical facilities.  According to the statement, anyone who violates new virus control regulations will be quickly prosecuted and could face arrest, jail or even the death penalty.  Many cities and provinces have introduced mandatory self-quarantine policies for anyone returning from elsewhere in the country. Transport in and out of Hubei also remains severely disrupted.  As the virus continues to spread, Wuhan announced Saturday its second rapidly constructed new hospital was ready to welcome patients.  Built from scratch to hold victims of the coronavirus, the Leishenshan hospital can hold up to 1,500 patients and will have 32 wards, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.  CCTV said that the first team of medical staff arrived at the hospital on Saturday.  The National Health Commission also announced at a news conference on Saturday that it had chosen a temporary official name for the virus -- Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, or NCP.  The graphic in this story has been updated to reflect the latest information.
2020-02-10	The Hubei health authority reported that 103 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Monday, raising the death toll in the epidemic's epicenter to 974.  This brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,011. Globally, a total of 1,013 people have died, including one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.  Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 2,097 cases of the virus in Hubei on Monday, which brings the total number of cases in the region to 31,728.  More than 25,000 patients have been hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,298 who are in critical condition, according to the health authority. More than two thousand patients have been cured and discharged.  The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 42,500. The vast majority of cases remains in mainland China.  China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
2020-02-10	Pudsey, England (CNN Business) More than 5,000 miles away from Wuhan, a small UK company is preparing to take a potential hit from the coronavirus.  Daletech, a manufacturer of industrial electronics, relies on parts that are made in China, and its executives are worried that factory closures caused by the coronavirus outbreak will prevent the arrival of vital components.  Based in the English town of Pudsey, Daletech relies on components from China that it buys from UK suppliers. Its 14 workers then turn out circuit boards and other electronics that are used in industrial products such as welding machines.  Daletech had planned for factories in China to be closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but it was caught off guard by the outbreak of a coronavirus that has killed over 900 people , infected more than 40,000 and prevented many manufacturing plants in the country from reopening.  Tracey Dawson, the managing director of Daletech, told CNN Business the company has already missed one expected parts shipment. She's now counting on a second shipment that's due to arrive in just seven days.  Read More

Kevin Frayer/Getty Images  The Hubei health authority in China reported that 94 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province today, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the outbreak to 1,068.  This brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,105.  The global death toll is at least 1,107, with one death in Hong Kong and one death in the Philippines.  By the numbers: Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 1,638 cases of the virus in Hubei today, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 33,366. The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases is now at least 44,138, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.  China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
2020-02-11	Hong Kong (CNN) China expects around 160 million employees to return to their workplaces in the next week, as the country seeks to minimize the economic impact of the novel coronavirus .  Next Tuesday marks the official end of the Lunar New Year period, an auspicious occasion on the Chinese calendar, that this year has been marred by the viral illness that has claimed more than 1,110 lives in mainland China.  The huge mobilization of people comes despite prior warnings for citizens to avoid large crowds. In a news briefing Tuesday, Chinese officials said action would be taken to reduce the risk of transmission.  These include limiting the carrying capacity of long-distance coaches, enhancing the sterilization of public transport, and carrying out temperature checks on passengers, said Xu Yahua, Director of Transport Services Department.  Deaths at the center of the outbreak, in Hubei province, appeared to have peaked Wednesday, though concern was growing over the situation on a cruise ship docked in Japan, where a quarantine officer himself became the latest case.  An additional 1,638 confirmed cases were reported in Hubei, central China, as of Wednesday morning. That is a lower increase than the previous day, suggesting that the spread of the virus may be leveling off in the central province.  A large question mark hangs over those figures, however. There remains uncertainty surrounding the efficiency of virus testing methods, as well as the length of the incubation period. Hospitals in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei are overwhelmed and struggling to cope, making it possible that some people with the virus may have been unable to see a doctor for diagnosis.  Chinese scientists have estimated that the outbreak could peak in mid-February, though previous estimations have had to be adjusted.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, warned Tuesday that the coronavirus is "a very grave threat." He added later that while the outbreak remains "very much an emergency" for China, there is a "realistic chance" of stopping it.  "We have to invest in preparedness," Tedros said, adding that richer countries should help invest in countries with a weaker health system. He warned the virus could "create havoc" if it reaches a country whose health system is not capable of handling such an epidemic.  A team of experts from the WHO arrived in China this week , where they are assisting the authorities with containment and treatment measures. The organization also gave the virus its official name Tuesday: Covid-19.  Cruise ship misery  The largest outbreak outside of mainland China remains in Yokohama, a Japanese port south of Tokyo where a cruise ship has been under tight quarantine for a week now.  Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said an additional 40 virus cases had been confirmed on board the Diamond Princess as of Wednesday, bringing the total number on board to 175.  One of those new cases, Kato said, was a "quarantine officer," who had come aboard the ship to help with testing passengers. He did not provide any further information on the officer; CNN is seeking further clarification.  In a statement, operator Princess Cruises said "we are following guidance from the Japan Ministry of Health on plans for disembarkation protocols to provide medical care for these new cases."  Another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, remains at sea, with more than 2,000 people on board. The vessel has been denied entry by at least four different ports over fears of the virus -- though no cases have been confirmed on board so far.  The ship had originally departed Singapore on January 16 and called into ports in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Hong Kong, according to marine trackers. In Hong Kong, the ship disembarked 1,254 guests and took on an additional 768 before departing, cruise company Holland America said.  Westerdam planned to make stops in the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and finally China but revised the ship's final destination from Shanghai to Yokohama following a warning by the US CDC on January 28, according to the company. The Philippines and Taiwan announced closure of their ports to cruise ships due to the fear of coronavirus, and Japanese authorities announced they would deny the ship entry -- leaving it in a "holding pattern" in the sea.  The cruise liner later announced plans to dock in Laem Chabang, Thailand to allow its passengers to disembark. However, the country's government said Tuesday that while Thailand will assist the ship, it will not allow passengers to leave.  "There are a lot of people on board, more than 2,000 people. We have to be careful, not allowing the situation to turn into stage 3 of disease spreading (in Thailand)," Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha said.

MUST WATCH China struggles to return to work after the coronavirus lockdown 02:26  Economic woes  The novel coronavirus has already had an impact on the world's second biggest economy. The outbreak coincided with China's most important holiday period, when many families traditionally spent money on food, gifts, and entertainment.  Instead, lockdowns in large cities forced businesses to temporarily close down.  Worker shortages, transport disruption, a lack of medical supplies and heavy-handed local officials are all making life difficult, the Chinese government said Tuesday.  "We have also noticed difficulties in fully resuming work," Cong Liang, a senior official at China's National Development and Reform Commission told reporters in Beijing, listing several factors including supply chain disruption, local government restrictions and a shortage of facial masks.  Senior officials in Beijing were speaking to reporters a day after an extended public holiday ended for much of the country, leading some businesses to try to reopen their doors. Others, though, remain closed, and local governments have issued mixed -- and in some cases muddled -- guidance about what companies should be doing.  Beijing reported five new cases Monday, bringing the number of infections in the capital to 342, authorities said Tuesday.  Also speaking Tuesday, US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell warned that the outbreak and its knock-on effects could hurt the global economy.  "We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Powell said in a report to Congress.  On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for greater efforts to minimize the impact of the epidemic on the country's economy, adding that any negative effects would be "short-lived."

Both South Korea and Canada sent extra flights this week, with Seoul saying it would endeavor to allow Chinese family members of its citizens to board the plane -- previously Chinese nationals have not been allowed on evacuation flights.  A Canadian plane carrying 185 passengers arrived in Vancouver early Tuesday. Its final destination is Trenton, Ontario, where the repatriated Canadians and their family members will be quarantined at an armed forces base for 14 days.  In the US, the first planeload of Americans who left Wuhan have completed their two-week quarantine and are being released.  There were no cases of coronavirus identified in the group, which arrived at the base in Riverside County on January 29. The 195 individuals completed their final health check Tuesday morning.  "I want to make one thing absolutely crystal clear: these folks do not have novel coronavirus," Riverside County health officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said.  Twenty-four patients will remain on the base Tuesday because they could not make travel arrangements, Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesperson for the Riverside County Department of Public Health, told CNN.  "Some have already left the base, others are departing soon," Arballo said the the news conference.
2020-02-11	Hong Kong (CNN) When the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, it did so over fears that smaller or less-developed countries would struggle to contain the virus .  The flu-like respiratory illness is highly contagious and the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first identified. Chinese authorities have shut down entire cities, suspended public transport and closed schools, businesses and factories in an effort to contain it.  "Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with it," said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when he announced the decision on January 30.  Since then, the number of confirmed cases reported in mainland China has more than quadrupled to more than 44,653. As of Wednesday morning, more than 1,100 people had died from the virus, while 4,740 patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital.  The virus has spread across Asia and into Europe and the United States, with more than 500confirmed cases in over two dozen countries and territories, with just two deaths outside mainland China.  While the majority of cases outside of mainland China have so far been connected to travelers from China, or those who have have recently been there, a small but growing number of patients have caught the virus locally.  That's worrying, because if self-sustaining outbreaks start occurring in nations with poor healthcare systems, the impact could be devastating.  "It's an enormous concern," said Jeremy Konyndyk, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.  "We still don't have a clear picture of how likely that is, but given transmissions dynamics in China and the speed with which cases have emerged in other countries, global spread seems highly plausible."  If China is struggling, how will other nations cope?  far higher than many low-income nations. China is ranked 51st out of 195 countries globally for its outbreak readiness, according to the Global Health Security Index . That's not on par with the wealthiest countries in the world, butfar higher than many low-income nations.  Authorities in China have suspended public transport and sealed off entire cities at the epicenter of the outbreak, effectively putting 60 million people on lockdown. They've built two new hospitals in less than two weeks, and dispatched thousands of medical workers to Wuhan.  Yet despite these unprecedented efforts , the country is struggling to keep the rapidly expanding outbreak under control.  People have spoken of sick family members turned away from hospitals, delays in testing and wards packed with feverish patients and limited screening or quarantine.  "If China is struggling to contain this, weaker countries will have an even harder time. And that suggests that the kind of transmission we're seeing in China might soon be mirrored elsewhere," said Konyndyk.  Where are the biggest concerns?  JUST WATCHED US citizen and 8-year-old daughter flee coronavirus epicenter Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US citizen and 8-year-old daughter flee coronavirus epicenter 02:37  Countries close to China in Southeast and East Asia have borne the brunt of the infections outside of the mainland, with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Thailand seeing local transmissions.  Some of those nations with coronavirus infections and their neighbors are among the poorest and most disaster-prone countries in the world.  Experts have raised fears that the health care infrastructure in these countries could crumble under the weight of an outbreak, and severely damage their economies , cause mass displacement and lead to other non-virus deaths.  Natural disasters in the Philippines already cause millions of dollars in damage and displace thousands each year.  Powerful typhoons and a series of earthquakes battered the country in 2019, and this year a volcanic eruption in southern Luzon Island is still posing a threat to nearby residents. A dengue epidemic last summer killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 250,000, demonstrating the strain on its health service.  To date, one person has died in the Philippines from coronavirus -- the first death outside mainland China -- and three people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus.  Students wearing protective face masks have their temperatures taken while entering their college campus in Manila.  The Asia-Pacific region is home to 60% of the world's population -- many of those countries are low or middle-income nations that are quickly industrializing.  According to the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board's 2019 report "A World At Risk," rapid urbanization can hasten the spread of disease during an outbreak.  Population booms and the migration of millions of people from rural areas to overcrowded cities with underdeveloped infrastructure and a lack of sanitation could further aggravate the spread of viruses.  India, with its population of 1.3 billion people, is one of the most rapidly developing countries in the world. By 2050, a United Nations report predicts India will have an additional 416 million urban residents. There have been three confirmed coronavirus cases in India, all three are students who had traveled from Wuhan.  While millions of people have lifted themselves out of poverty in India over the past 20 years, millions of others have been left behind.  Densely-packed city slums where thousands of people live in close proximity to one another in often sub-standard conditions could make it difficult to control a virulent viral outbreak.  Smaller, sparsely populated nations in the Pacific Ocean are also extremely vulnerable to an outbreak, though coronavirus has not been confirmed on any of these territories.  Samoa is still reeling from a measles epidemic that infected 5,707 people and killed 83, many of them children. The Samoan government declared a state of emergency in December and shut schools and government services while launching a mass vaccination campaign.  Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said recently that "another infectious disease outbreak will have catastrophic effects on the whole of Samoa."  Some countries have not yet reported any cases, including Indonesia, a nation of 264 million, which typically receives large numbers of Chinese tourists. Likewise, no confirmed cases have been reported in Myanmar, which borders China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos.  An outbreak in Myanmar, for example, could strain a country that's still grappling with the legacy of decades of brutal military rule, where one in four people live in poverty, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis are among the leading causes of death.  Frontline workers risk their lives  JUST WATCHED Coronavirus whistleblower doctor being treated for virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus whistleblower doctor being treated for virus 02:56  One of the biggest concerns of a global spread would be the threat of contagion to frontline health workers, said Konyndyk from the Center for Global Development.  "Infection prevention procedures in the developing world tend to be poorly managed and weakly resourced," he said.  During the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019, health workers were between 21 and 32 times more likely to be infected than people in the general population, according to a report by the WHO  "Health worker infections are a huge blow, because beyond adding to case counts, they degrade the health system's capacity to fight the outbreak and they undermine the health system's work on a range of other health risks as well," Konyndyk said.  Community distrust of medical workers in some places could be disastrous, potentially leading more deaths and further spreading the virus.  When Ebola struck last year in the DRC, fear, rumors and mistrust of public health authorities and politicians meant people stayed home instead of going for treatment. Despite millions of dollars in funding and an effective experimental vaccine, Ebola spread to new provinces and re-infected areas thought to be rid of the virus.  "Spread of this novel coronavirus to such an area would easily overwhelm their testing and treatment capabilities without international assistance," said Courtney Kansler, Senior Health Intelligence Analyst with WorldAware.  "Venezuela is another good example, where there is a near-complete lack of basic medical services and healthcare infrastructure nationwide," she said.  Currently there is no evidence of confirmed coronavirus cases on the African continent or in South America.  World not ready for a pandemic  Medical staff are seen at a makeshift hospital converted from an exhibition center in Wuhan.  The WHO has appealed for a coordinated international response to help stop the outbreak from spreading, and for wealthier countries to support those with weaker health systems.  But as more countries shut their borders to travelers from China, there are concerns the restrictions will hinder sharing of public health data, or disrupt supply chains.  The WHO has not declared a pandemic -- which is essentially when there's a sustained spread of the disease in numerous countries.  But while there have been big advances in transparency, data sharing, and research tools, "the world remains meaningfully unready for a dangerous pandemic," said Konyndyk.  "Our existing medical and public health systems would be overwhelmed rapidly and there is no clear plan-B scenario for what countries should do once that happens," he said.
2020-02-12	The Hubei health authority reported that 242 more people died from the coronavirus in Hubei province on Wednesday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the outbreak to 1,310.  This brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,355. The global death toll is at least 1,357, with one death in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.  Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 14,840 cases of the virus in Hubei on Wednesday, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 48,206. The 14,840 figure includes both test confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases.  The government explained they are now adding "clinically diagnosed cases" in the tally of cases to make it easier for these patients to receive treatment early.  There have been 33,693 patients hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,437 who are in critical condition, according to the health authority, adding that 3,441 patients have recovered and been discharged.  By the numbers: The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases has now exceeded 60,015 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.  China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.

2020-02-14	US President Donald Trump speaks to National border Patrol Council members in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House on Feb. 14 in Washington, DC. Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images  President Trump on Friday repeated the theory that the novel coronavirus will die out as temperatures rise in the spring, but scientists insist it’s just too soon to say for sure.  Infectious disease experts studying the virus say it may have a seasonal variation, or it may not. Several tell CNN it’s too early to tell, and nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior.  “There’s a theory that in April, when it gets warm, historically, that has been able to kill the virus. So, we don’t know yet. We’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner, so that will be a great thing in China and other places,” Trump said at a Border Patrol event at the White House.  CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN in an interview, which aired Thursday, that the coronavirus may or may not be around past this year and it may or may not follow a seasonal variation — insisting only time will tell.  "We don't know a lot about this virus," he said. "This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission."  Trump also estimated that there were “around 12” confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US. As of Friday, 15 individuals tested by the CDC tested positive for the coronavirus.
2020-02-15	Hong Kong (CNN) If it weren't for the novel coronavirus outbreak, Xu Mingxi would have been in class at a prestigious New York university this week.  Instead, the 22-year-old has spent the past three weeks confined to his family's apartment in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak, which is currently on lockdown to prevent the virus spreading.  But even if Xu could leave home, the United States -- where he's studied for the past four-and-a-half years -- won't let him in.  Over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) away in Beijing, Alex -- who asked not to use her real name for fear of online retribution -- is in a similar situation. She's spent the past two weeks at home with her mom and grandpa, being delivered groceries by community leaders. She's worried she won't be able to fly to Sydney to study later this month and may have to delay her law degree by a semester.  As novel coronavirus spreads, over 60 countries have imposed travel restrictions on Chinese citizens, hoping to limit their exposure to the virus that has killed more than 1,600 people, almost allin mainland China,and infected over 68,000 worldwide. Both Australia and the US have put temporary bans on foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival.  That has locked Xu and Alex out of their studies -- and they are by no means alone.  In 2017, an estimated 900,000 Chinese tertiary students studied abroad. Around half of those went to either the United States or Australia , contributing billions of dollars to their economies -- money that those countries now stand to lose.  travel ban hit on January 31, shortly before many universities were due to resume. But when Australia imposed its restrictions at the start of February, authorities estimated that It is not clear how many of the 360,000 Chinese students studying in the US were outside the country when the UStravel ban hit on January 31, shortly before many universities were due to resume.But when Australia imposed its restrictions at the start of February, authorities estimated that 56% of Chinese students -- about 106,680 people -- were still abroad. Term was due to begin in late February or early March.  "For Australia, it couldn't have come at a worse time. It's exactly the time of the year in which people are coming from China to Australia," said Andrew Norton, a professor in the practice of higher education policy at the Australian National University. The virus outbreak coincided with the Lunar New Year -- the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, when many students go home to see their family.  A city on lockdown  At first, it was just a normal holiday period for Xu, catching up with friends in Wuhan and eating food. The coronavirus outbreak didn't seem like a huge issue.  Timeline  How events unfolded December 8: The first patient of Wuhan coronavirus developed symptoms December 31: The first cases reported to the World Health Organization January 1: The market in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed to have started shuts down for disinfection January 8: Chinese scientists identify the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus January 23: Authorities put Wuhan into partial lockdown January 31: US announces it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last 14 days February 1: Australia bans all travellers entering from mainland China    Source: CNN reporting    Xu wore a mask and avoided the area around the seafood market linked to the outbreak, which is only a few kilometers from his house.  Then on January 23, the night before he was set to fly back to New York, Wuhan authorities announced they were locking down the city . There was still time to leave, but Xu decided not to go -- he thought he would be safer inside Wuhan, and that the lockdown wouldn't last long.  On January 27, his graduate program in interactive telecommunications at New York University (NYU) restarted. On January 31, the US government announced it wouldn't let any foreign nationals flying from mainland China into the country.  Xu was told he could take classes remotely, but to him it wasn't worth paying $62,000 per year in course fees for distance learning. He decided to take a break this semester. That will delay his graduation by six months.  The situation in Australia  The University of Sydney , where Alex studies, is making allowances for Chinese students.  Those affected by coronavirus travel bans can study remotely, start their semester a few weeks late, or defer their degree. Alex will defer this semester if she hasn't been able to fly back by mid-March.  She pays about $45,000 Australian dollars ($30,280) each year -- more than local students, who are eligible for reduced fees.  has When Australia imposed its travel ban on February 1, it was effective immediately. While the WHOhas advised against such measures , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: "Our medical advice is it's in the interest of Australians to do so."  At the time, there were 80 Chinese people in transit -- including 47 students.  Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram told the ABC that 18 decided to go back to China, while the others were put into self-isolation for 14 days. "This was a very difficult situation for the students, of course, we recognize that," Outram said. "They were caught between, you know, an epidemic in China and coming to Australia and having issues raised with their visas."  A man walks on an empty street in Wuhan, China, on February 13, 2020.  David, a 24-year-old studying engineering at the University of Sydney, who has been in self-imposed quarantine at his home in southern Guangdong province for weeks, said the Australian government's actions made him feel "completely neglected."  "I'm a taxpayer, I do my part in society, I've donated blood," said David, who asked not to use his real name for fear that his comments could hurt his chance of getting an Australian visa. "After all the things I've done, you still consider me not part of your society."  The logistical problems created by the virus are not short-term issues.  Universities will need to work out how to accommodate the backlog of students like Xu and Alex who have been delayed, as well as students who would have taken those courses anyway -- and some universities just won't have capacity, Norton said.  Protesters hold placards during a rally against an inbound travel ban on foreign travellers from China in Sydney on February 7, 2020.  What this means for the universities  If thousands of students are forced to forgo this semester, universities in Australia and the United States stand to lose billions of dollars.  In Australia, 23.3% of universities' total revenue came from international students in 2017 -- and Chinese students made up over 38% of all international enrollments in 2018. In total, international education contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars ($25 billion) to the Australian economy in the 2018-2019 financial year.  In the US, Chinese students contributed $14.9 billion to the US economy in 2018, according to government data.  Norton, the professor of higher education policy at the Australian National University, believes that most Chinese students in Australia will need to delay their study by at least a trimester or semester. That means that, in the short term, universities in Australia face an estimated 2 to 3 billion Australian dollar cash flow hit from students who can't make it to class, he said.  "The government realizes this will have huge economic costs that effect them as well as the universities and tourism providers," he said.  In the US, there had already been weakening demand from Chinese students partly due to tensions on American campuses amid the ongoing trade war , said Rahul Choudaha, a US-based analyst of international student trends and a visiting scholar at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at UC Berkeley.  "It's kind of a very unexpected, unwanted, undesirable speed bump," he said.  It's also an issue facing universities outside of the United States and Australia. South Korea, for instance, has around 70,000 Chinese students at its universities. The new semester kicks off in March, but already many universities have opted to delay the start of semester by two weeks, to accommodate students living in cities on lockdown.  A man wears a protective mask as he walks in Wuhan on February 13, 2020.  Anger at Chinese people  The coronavirus crisis struck at a time when hostile debates over Chinese Communist Party influence on Australian and US campuses were already complicating life for Chinese students overseas.  Chinese students have been accused of stealing American secrets to diminish US influence, especially as the trade war between China and American rages. In Australia, politicians have raised concern over whether the Chinese influence on campus is limiting free speech  For Chinese people in Australia and the US, that public debate has sometimes been alienating  Now, the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more anti-Chinese sentiment  While stuck at home, Alex has been taken by the different reactions to the outbreak on China's heavily controlled internet and the internet beyond the so-called Great Firewall. In China, there are messages of support for Wuhan, but internationally she's seen anger directed at Chinese people.  "It's waves and waves of hate," she said, pointing to online commentators who argued that Chinese people deserved the outbreak because they eat bat -- something that has not been linked to the outbreak. "I felt misunderstood, I felt abandoned. I felt I don't matter."  Alex says that on her social media feeds the situation has been turned into a Chinese versus Australian dichotomy, when really, it's about the virus versus people.  She's afraid that when she gets back to Australia, she could be the target of racial abuse. People who look Chinese are "paying the price just because other people are scared," she said.  Economic hit  Already, experts are predicting that the economic hit of the coronavirus could be much more significant than the SARS epidemic in 2003.  If China's economy is struggling, Chinese parents may have less money to spend on educating their children overseas.  David believes that the perceived animosity toward Chinese students in Australia may result in students opting to go elsewhere. When parents are looking at which country to send their children, they don't just look at the quality of education -- but also at how welcoming and stable a society is, he says.  As the quality of China's own universities continues to improve, staying at home could also become a more attractive proposition, said Choudah, the higher education analyst.  A few days ago, a fellow Chinese national asked Alex whether she would recommend studying law in Australia. Alex answered honestly: she's torn.  Studying abroad can be a positive experience, she said, but it also carries the risk of racial abuse, especially now that people of Asian origin are viewed with suspicion as the virus spreads.
2020-02-16	There were 100 more deaths due to the coronavirus in China's Hubei province Sunday, the health authorities there said. That raises the death toll at the center of the outbreak to 1,696.

Cheng Min/Xinhua/Sipa USA  German researchers called symptom-based screening to detect the novel coronavirus “ineffective” in a new analysis published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The researchers assessed the screening process for 126 people evacuated to Germany from Wuhan, China.  All 126 travelers, mostly German nationals, left Wuhan on February 1 and were screened for symptoms and clinical signs of infection before they were evacuated. Despite requiring travelers to undergo a multiple screenings once in Germany, two travelers were ultimately positive for the novel coronavirus. According to the researchers, “a symptom-based screening process was ineffective in detecting” the virus.  During the evacuation flight from Germany, 10 passengers were isolated: two because of contact with a confirmed coronavirus patient; six exhibited symptoms; and two passengers who had accompanied one of the six symptomatic travelers. Upon arrival, all 10 of these passengers were transferred to University Hospital Frankfurt and all tested negative for coronavirus.  The remaining 116 passengers underwent another medical assessment and one passenger had an elevated temperature and cough. This patient ultimately tested negative for coronavirus.  Of the remaining 115 patients, 114 consented to a throat swab to test for coronavirus. Of those 114 travelers, two tested positive for coronavirus. These two patients were isolated at a hospital. One patient had a faint rash and sore throat. According to the researchers, the two isolated patients were “well” and had no fever in the seven days after hospitalization. Aside from the ineffectiveness of the screening process, the authors found that the virus could potentially be spread by those who exhibited mild symptoms: “Shedding of potentially infectious virus may occur in persons who have no fever and no signs or only minor signs of infection.”  Over 73,000 people around the world have been infected with the coronavirus, most of those cases in mainland China. There have been more than 1,800 deaths, including five people outside of mainland China.

Trump pardons  President Trump granted clemency to 11 white-collar criminals yesterday in an extraordinary flex of his post-impeachment presidential power. He commuted the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell the US Senate seat once held by Barack Obama. He also pardoned a former New York police commissioner convicted of tax fraud and lying to officials, an investment banker known as the "Junk Bond King" and a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers convicted of a felony for his role in a bribery case. The clemency efforts were a long time coming. Aides previously had tried to convince Trump against reducing Blagojevich's sentence, but some staffers said the President feels newly emboldened after his Senate acquittal.  2. 2020 Dems  JUST WATCHED Sanders refuses to say if he'd accept Bloomberg's money Replay More Videos ...

2020-02-19	Hong Kong (CNN) The death toll from the novel coronavirus passed 2,000 on Wednesday, marking a grim milestone in the battle to contain the deadly outbreak, as countries across Asia registered an uptick in confirmed cases.  More than 74,000 people have now been infected by the virus in mainland China, with more than 1,000 other cases detected in 28 countries and regions.  On Wednesday morning, China reported an additional 136 deaths, bringing the total number of deaths there to 2,004, and the global death toll to 2,010.  There are now six deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, outside mainland China. Hong Kong reported that a second person had died in the semi-autonomous territory, according to local health authorities. The victim is a 70-year-old man who was diagnosed on February 14.  Though the vast majority of deaths continue to be centered in China, concern is growing over expanding outbreaks in Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.  On Wednesday, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced 15 additional cases, bringing the total number to 46 -- an increase of almost 50% in one day. Singapore has at least 81 cases and Japan has 68 cases and one death, not including the more than 500 cases aboard the virus-stricken cruise ship docked in the Japanese city of Yokohama.  Amid the sudden spike in numbers, Japan's health ministry has issued guidelines for people experiencing symptoms similar to the coronavirus in an effort to to prevent worried citizens from inundating hospitals by providing them with specific hotlines to call.  China praises virus response  In China, promising signs have emerged of a potential leveling off in the rate of infection. Outside of Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of new cases dropped for the 15th consecutive day, according to the country's National Health Commission.  Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday that China's measures to prevent and control the epidemic "are achieving visible progress," according to state news Xinhua  Xi said, "the battle has reached a crucial time" and China had "mobilized the entire country, and adopted the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough prevention and control measures," Xinhua reported.  "Thanks to those arduous efforts, the situation is witnessing positive changes," Xi said.  Headlines across Chinese state media on Wednesday morning were full of positivity, touting China's ability to get on top of the virus's spread. One commentary in Xinhua said the fight against coronavirus would "not stop China's march towards rejuvenation."  Meanwhile, Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the state media outlet Global Times, tweeted that the country was on its way to victory.  "Daily new infection cases outside Hubei fell below 100 for the first time according to data released on Tuesday. We are on the way to the victory," tweeted Hu  But experts have warned that it is too soon to tell whether the virus is under control.  "This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected. It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference Monday.  JUST WATCHED Wuhan hospital director dies from novel coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Wuhan hospital director dies from novel coronavirus 01:01  Stringent and often draconian measures are also being ramped up in much of the country. CNN analysis found that on Chinese government orders, some 780 million people are still living under some form of restrictive movement, including all of Hubei, the northeastern province of Liaoning, and China's two most important cities, Beijing and Shanghai.  It comes as authorities make an effort to return to something like normality in many major cities and commercial hubs, with the long break forced by the outbreak taking its toll on the country's economy.  On Tuesday, Liu Zhiming, director of the Wuchang hospital in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, himself died of the virus, according to a statement released by local government authorities.  Liu was a neurosurgeon and the most senior health worker known to have died as a result of the coronavirus epidemic. His death could renew criticism that the government has not done enough to protect frontline medical workers, many of whom are overworked and overstretched.  Passengers start leaving Diamond Princess  A passenger of the Diamond Princess leaves Daikoku Pier on February 19 in Yokohama, Japan.  Outside of mainland China, the worst single outbreak has been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, under tight quarantine for two weeks in the Japanese port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. More than 545 of the 3,600 people on board have tested positive for the virus so far. On Tuesday, 88 new cases were reported.  On Wednesday morning local time, passengers began to disembark from the ship after Japan's health ministry ended the quarantine period.  Questions have been raised, however, over the effectiveness of the isolation procedures onboard and whether disembarking passengers could pose a risk to the public as more test positive for coronavirus after leaving the ship.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement criticizing the quarantine efforts taken on the Diamond Princess.  "While the quarantine potentially conferred a significant public health benefit in slowing transmission, CDC's assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship," the CDC said.  "CDC believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk," it continued.  All American passengers and crew will not be allowed to return to the US for at least 14 days after they leave the Diamond Princess, according to a US State Department spokesperson. There are more than 100 US citizens on board the ship or in hospitals in Japan.  Late Sunday, 328 American passengers were evacuated from the ship and are now in quarantine at two US bases. Of the 14 Americans who tested positive during final screenings, 13 are being treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and one patient who flew into Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, is currently under isolation at a Napa County medical center.  Australia, Hong Kong, Canada and the UK are also working to evacuated their citizens off the ship.  Separately, 781 passengers from the Westerdam cruise ship are one step closer to returning home after Cambodian health authorities said they had tested negative for coronavirus.  The Westerdam was refused entry from multiple ports before it was finally was able to berth in Cambodia on February 13. As of Tuesday, only 1,000 people were left on the ship, while another 500 or so were in Phnom Penh.  At the time, no cases of the virus had been reported aboard the ship. However, an 83-year-old American passenger tested positive for the virus in Malaysia while she was on transit home after disembarking.  The Cambodian government said the negative test results were from both passengers on the ship and in the city. Those still awaiting testing are not being held under any strict quarantine measures, Ministry of Health spokeswoman Dr. Or Vandline said.
2020-02-19	Jan Swartz speaks in 2017. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images  The president of the company that owns the stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess greeted disembarking passengers in Tokyo on Wednesday, acknowledging that customers had endured a "challenging" situation following an outbreak of coronavirus on the vessel.  "This is an unprecedented situation," Jan Swartz, President of Princess Cruises, said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.  "Nobody going on vacation thinks that they're going to be notified in the last days that they've got an extension ... and they're not going to be allowed to leave their cabins," she added.  The Diamond Princess ship became a floating quarantine zone earlier this month. Dozens of passengers tested positive for the novel coronavirus, effectively trapping more than 3,000 people, including 428 Americans, on board.  A total of 624 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been linked to the boat -- the largest outbreak outside of China.  Swartz also specifically highlighted the actions of the ship’s crew. Japan’s government did not allow the roughly 1,000 crew members to be quarantined unless they took ill, instead asking them to work and serve the rest of the passengers throughout the two-week period.  “I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world really lifted each other's hearts, as did social media play a critical role in that.”  "Our guests shared stories about living in the cabin for 14 days, clearly it was an uncomfortable, challenging situation," Swartz added.  Even though the departing passengers have tested negative for the virus and endured the 14-day quarantine, there is mounting evidence from infectious disease experts that they could unknowingly be carrying the virus back into their communities.  On Monday, the United States evacuated more than 300 American passengers who had tested negative for the virus from the Diamond Princess, only to discover that more than a dozen of them were infected.  Canada, Australia and Hong Kong have arranged charter flights to take their citizens home after they leave the ship.  Princess Cruises, which operates a fleet of 20 ships, is the third largest cruise line in the world.  Because of the coronavirus outbreak onboard the Diamond Princess, the company has canceled dozens of sailings, and is moving one of its ships, the Sapphire Princess, from Shanghai to Australia.  Shares in Princess Cruises' parent company Carnival Corporation are down nearly 16% for the year. Carnival said last week that the hit to global bookings and canceled voyages "will have a material impact" on its finances.  Carnival runs its flagship Carnival Cruise Line, the Princess Cruises brand and the Holland America Line, whose fleet includes the Westerdam, a ship that has been linked to one confirmed case of the coronavirus.

2020-02-19	Hong Kong (CNN) Weeks into the novel coronavirus crisis , the outbreak finally appears to be stabilizing in central China, where the virus was initially detected before it spread throughout the country and the world.  Small outbreaks continue to fast expand elsewhere, however, not least of which on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, where two deaths were confirmed Thursday, the first from the hundreds of cases on the ship, which has begun disembarking passengers after a 14-day quarantine this week.  The global death toll now stands at 2,129, after an additional 108 deaths were reported in Hubei province as of Thursday morning. All but 11 deaths have occurred in mainland China. On Thursday, South Korea reported its first death from the virus.  An additional 349 cases were confirmed in Hubei, more than 1,300 fewer than reported the day before. Outside of the provincial capital Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, the daily count of patients who have been treated and discharged has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for four consecutive days now, according to state news agency Xinhua  There is some uncertainty of how cases are being diagnosed in Hubei, with the criteria for diagnosing the virus outside of the lab shifting in recent weeks. Chinese authorities this week switched back to reporting only laboratory confirmed cases from Hubei, after last week allowing clinical diagnoses by doctors -- based on symptoms or more immediate tests -- to be counted towards the province's totals.  More than 10,330 patients have been discharged across Hubei so far, though some 43,000 remain in hospital, 2,050 of whom are in a critical condition, the provincial health authority said.  The Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) previously estimated that the virus peaked in late January, according to data from lab tests. However, the number of clinically diagnosed cases -- patients with symptoms who could not be tested or were believed to have falsely tested negative -- continued to rise well into February.  While the data from the epicenter of the outbreak appears to be positive, the crisis may not be over yet, either inside China or worldwide. Experts have warned there could be a renewed increase in cases once China properly returns to work late this week or next -- hundreds of millions of people around the country have been on lockdown for weeks now.  The number of cases is also continuing to grow alarmingly in several places outside of the mainland, though still far short of the figures seen in China. On Thursday, South Korea recorded an additional 31 confirmed cases, bringing the country's total to 82. That came after an increase of 20 on Wednesday, previously the largest single-day jump in Korea.  In Singapore the infection rate continues to climb, with 84 confirmed cases. Similarly, in Hong Kong, there are 63 confirmed cases, and two deaths.  In Japan, where global attention has been focused on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, the worst outbreak outside of mainland China, there have been 68 cases confirmed with no connection to the ship, raising concerns of a self-sustaining outbreak in the country.  Cruise ship disembarks  More passengers from the Diamond Princess disembarked Thursday morning , though serious questions remain over the effectiveness of the two-week quarantine imposed on the ship since it first docked at the Japanese port of Yokohama.  When the first load of passengers left the ship over the weekend, on a pair of flights to the US, more than a dozen of the 300 or so on board were found to be showing symptoms of the virus . All of those who had boarded the planes were supposedly coronavirus free, according to Japanese authorities.  The Japanese quarantine officially ended Wednesday, and the first group of passengers began disembarking. Hundreds of cases have been confirmed on board, however, and on Thursday authorities in Japan confirmed the first two deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Jan Swartz, President and CEO of the vessel's operator Princess Cruises, who had flown to Japan to greet the passengers as they left the ship, said that those on board united to help each through an "unprecedented situation."  "I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world, really lifted each other's hearts," Swartz said.  Multiple countries have arranged flights to bring their citizens home once they disembark -- so long as they do not test positive for the virus. Canada has chartered a plane from Tokyo's Haneda airport Friday. The 47 Canadians who had been found to have the virus would receive medical care in Japan, the government said in a statement.  The early evacuation of Americans from the ship was seen as something of an implicit criticism of the Japanese quarantine, with the Centers for Disease Control saying that remaining on the ship was an ongoing risk to US citizens.  Speaking to CNN this week, Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University who visited the ship, said he was highly concerned about the effectiveness of the quarantine and the precautions taken on board.  "I was so scared because there was no way to tell where the virus is and everybody was not careful about it," Iwata said. "There was no single infection control person inside the ship -- the bureaucrats were in charge of everything."

In China, while the worst of the virus is hopefully past, the economic cost has yet to be fully realized, and there are fears it could continue to grow and have knock-on ramifications for the global economy.  China's central bank promised more support Wednesday for companies, including lowering lending rates, increased credit support and providing medium and long-term loans. The People's Bank of China said the epidemic "has had some impact on the Chinese economy, but the shock will be short-lived and will not change the country's sound economic fundamentals."  Other outlooks are not so rosy . Around a third of 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have.  Smaller companies account for around 60% of China's GDP, and employ a massive 80% of all workers, according to government statistics published last September.  "The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back," wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month.  He warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down -- a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes.  Even as the country starts to get back to work, problems remain for smaller firms. According to the state-backed Global Times , Chinese factories and businesses trying to resume operations this week have been "faced with tremendous risks and challenges, from lengthy applications to tough restrictions and shortages in cash, labor and supplies."  Companies have reported having to submit up to 21 separate documents, including a 15-page application form, emergency plans and various other letters of commitment, to local officials. A screenshot of an application from a company in Sichuan province went viral on social media this week -- a single application to resume operation require a total of nine stamps from various county and provincial officials.  "These are the unintended consequences of the battle against the epidemic: the restrictive measures put in place to stop the virus have also restricted companies from resuming production," Tian Yun, director of the China Society of Macroeconomics Research Center, told the Global Times. "In some places, officials have taken the battle to a whole new, unnecessary level."

2020-02-20	The Hubei health authority in China reported that 115 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Thursday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 2,144.  Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus in Hubei on Thursday. The total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak is now 62,442.  By the numbers: The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,233. The global death toll is at least 2,244, with 11 deaths outside of mainland China.  Japan has reported three deaths from the coronavirus, while Hong Kong and Iran have each reported two deaths from coronavirus. Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea and France have each reported one death.  The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 76,154 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.  China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later today.
2020-02-20	New York (CNN Business) It was shaping up to be a quiet day on Wall Street. Then around midday, stocks sold off sharply and investors scrambled. With no obvious catalyst triggering the selloff, worries about the coronavirus outbreak seemed to be the obvious suspect.  Dow INDU At its worst, thewas off by 388 points, with all three major stock indexes sharply in the red. The drop in stocks followed a dip in Treasury bond yields, which move opposite to prices, and implied that investor appetite for safe haven bonds was high.  S&P 500 SPX Nasdaq Composite COMP Still, investors scrambled to make sense of it. The dramatic selloff only lasted a short while and was followed by a swift rebound. Stocks still closed in the red, however, with the Dow ending 0.4%, or 128 points, lower. Thefell 0.4%, and thefinished down 0.7%.  In recent days, investor confidence built up amid hopes that new cases of the virus were slowing down.

2020-02-20	London (CNN Business) Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, has warned of a "very weak" start to the year as the coronavirus keeps factories shuttered in China and dents demand for the transport of goods.  The Danish ship operator said Thursday that it has canceled more than 50 trips to and from Asia since the Lunar New Year holiday was extended because of the outbreak. Shipping rates are expected to decrease as demand slips , the company said in an earnings report.  "We estimate factories in China are operating at 50% to 60% of capacity," CEO Søren Skou said on an earnings call.  Maersk expects production to ramp up to 90% by the first week of March, but Skou cautioned that "obviously there are still a lot of uncertainties."  In an interview with Julia Chatterley on CNN Business' First Move, Skou said that with 30% of the company's business related to China, the impact from the virus is "quite substantial." What matters most, he said, is what happens in the coming weeks.  Read More
2020-02-21	Hong Kong (CNN) Hopes for a slowdown in the spread of the novel coronavirus were dashed Friday as the number of new cases rose in China , and outbreaks worsened in Japan and South Korea.  Authorities in China's Hubei province confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus Thursday morning, 62 more than the previous day, taking the total number of cases at the epicenter of the outbreak to 62,442.  Later Thursday, provincial authorities upgraded that figure to 631, after changing the criteria to include figures from a prison in the region.  There are an additional 14,000 or so cases outside Hubei, with the majority in other parts of mainland China.  The death toll from the outbreak now stands at 2,249, after more deaths in mainland China Thursday, including 115 in Hubei, seven more than the previous day  More than 42,000 patients remain hospitalized across Hubei, including 2,018 in a critical condition. So far, 11,788 patients have been treated and discharged since the outbreak began.  On Thursday, the Jiangxia District No. 1 Hospital in Wuhan confirmed that another doctor -- Peng Yinhua -- died of the novel coronavirus after treating patients. Dr. Peng's death prompted grief on social media after local newspapers reported the 29-year-old delayed his marriage because of the epidemic.  Chinese officials revealed that six doctors had died and more than 3,000 hospital staff had been infected with the virus, among whom 1,716 had been confirmed by nucleic acid tests as of February 11.  Meanwhile, fears are growing of self-sustaining epidemics elsewhere in Asia.  Outside China , the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in South Korea and Japan, where hundreds of people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarking passengers this week from Yokohama Bay.  The number of cases in South Korea has soared, from 28 a week ago to at least 204 as of Friday afternoon. Two patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the country, where the outbreak is centered around the southern city of Daegu.  Among the new cases, most are linked to the Shincheonji group. South Korean authorities Thursday were seeking to question more than 1,000 members of the religious group who attended a service with one of the recently confirmed cases.  Daegu's mayor asked the congregation and their family members to self-quarantine at home.  Three other new cases connected to Daegu involved members of the military.  Medical teams have been dispatched to the city, where they will test people without overseas travel history or relation to other confirmed cases. Until now, tests have only been conducted on cases with recent travel history to China, Hong Kong, and Macao, or on people showing suspicious symptoms of the virus after being in contact with confirmed cases.  On Friday, the South Korean government designated Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo as "special management areas" for infectious disease. Meanwhile, South Korea's military administration temporarily suspended drafting soldiers from Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang Province.  Japan outbreak  In Japan, where attention has been focused for weeks on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked at Yokohama, fears are growing of a separate outbreak centered around Nagano, northwest of Tokyo.  At least 87 cases have been confirmed in Japan unrelated to the ship, and one death. Cases have also been reported as far south as Okinawa and on Kyushu, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.  On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a new travel advisory for Japan, but only at the mildest level, which recommends people "practice usual precautions" and avoid contact with sick people.  "At this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Japan," the agency said. By comparison, it currently lists mainland China as a level 3 warning and advises travelers to "avoid nonessential travel." The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.  Hundreds of travelers on board the Diamond Princess were due to disembark Friday. Many have already left the ship and begun flying home.  As they have done so, however, more evidence has emerged about the alleged failure of the quarantine on board. Around a dozen passengers who were deemed not to have the virus were later found to be showing symptoms when they flew to the US, leading them to require isolation from other passengers on the evacuation flight.  An additional two passengers evacuated from the ship tested positive on arrival in Australia Friday.  Brendan Murphy, chief medical officer for the Australian government, said in a statement that 164 people from the Diamond Princess arrived to the Howard Springs Quarantine Facility in Darwin on Thursday to begin their 14-day quarantine.  Upon arrival, six passengers had minor respiratory symptoms and/or fevers. Of those, two people have since tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  Murphy said both patients "remain well" and were being housed in an isolation unit at the quarantine facility. Murphy added that "the development of positive cases after return to Australia is not unexpected" as there was evidence of spread of infection on board the Diamond Princess.

MUST WATCH Passenger weeps after leaving cruise ship quarantine 03:08  Murphy reassured other passengers and the crew on the Qantas evacuation flight, saying that "all measures were taken to ensure their protection" and that "the small number of passengers on the plane meant passengers could be spread out. Higher risk passengers were seated in separate sections."  Hundreds of the 3,000 or so people on board the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus during the two-week quarantine. On Thursday, Japanese health officials announced that two passengers with the virus had died in hospital. Both were Japanese citizens in their eighties.  The outbreak is expected to put the cruise industry under pressure as passengers defer or cancel trips. Airlines are also expected to take a major hit , after dozens of carriers cut flights to China and elsewhere in the affected region.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the total global lost revenue for airlines due to coronavirus could be $29.3 billion.  IATA expected a potential 13% drop in passengers for the year across the Asia-Pacific region, and the financial impact will be "severe for those particularly exposed to the China market," it said in a statement Thursday.
2020-02-21	The University of Hong Kong  There are 34 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, according to an announcement Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This includes 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 13 US cases.  "We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday.  About the cases: The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China. There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated.  The 13 US cases include seven in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California.  The 13th US case was confirmed overnight in Humboldt County, California. County officials offered few details but said a close contact with symptoms was also undergoing testing, and both are self-isolating at home.

2020-02-21	London (CNN Business) A growing number of companies are warning that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting sales or profit targets for the first three months of the year. Some are even getting specific, and putting a number on the financial damage.  Yet the situation remains highly uncertain, and many of the financial projections assume the coronavirus will be contained in China over the coming weeks and months, and that there won't be a major outbreak in another country. If the Chinese economy doesn't come roaring back as quickly as expected, investors could be caught off guard.  "Investors have largely taken the view that the impact will be temporary, hopefully short-lived, and that most of the weakness should be reversed with a strong rebound in the quarters that follow," Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote this week.  The International Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines, warned this week that coronavirus could cost global carriers nearly $30 billion in lost revenue . Global demand would drop by 4.7%, the first overall decline since the financial crisis.  The group's financial estimate is based, however, on the disruption caused by SARS when it ripped through China in 2003. That virus caused real damage over a period of months, including for airlines, but the sharp decline in activity was "followed by an equally quick recovery," according to IATA.  "We don't yet know exactly how the [current] outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not," the group warned.  Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, said Thursday that it was having a "very weak" start to the year, with factories in China, which make the goods it transports, running at around 50% to 60% of capacity. CEO Søren Skou said he expects production to ramp up to 90% by the first week of March, but he cautioned that there are "still a lot of uncertainties."  Shipping containers sit aboard a Maersk cargo ship in Hong Kong.  Disney DIS warned that income from its parks in China could drop by $280 million this quarter, assuming the resorts are closed for two months. "The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations," CFO Christine McCarthy said on an earnings call.  How quickly China recovers matters a great deal to global companies. The country is the world's factory, churning out products such as the iPhone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper. It also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products, tourism and cars. China's economy accounted for roughly 4% of world GDP in 2003; it now makes up 16% of global output.  Damage done  The coronavirus has already caused significant damage.  China's approach to containing the spread of the virus has kept cities under lockdown and factories shuttered, causing widespread disruption to businesses across the globe, which rely on China as a manufacturing powerhouse and a market for their goods.  Qantas Airways QABSY Air France-KLM AFLYY said this week that the virus could shave up to $100 million off profit from the second half of its fiscal year.estimated the virus could slash its earnings by as much as $216 million between February and April.  Jaguar Land Rover, which has resorted to flying parts out of China to keep production going in Europe, expects to take a hit from the collapse in demand for cars in the country, where passenger car sales plunged by 92% in the first two weeks of February, according to an industry association.  Apple AAPL Wynn Resorts WYNN Qualcomm QCOM Other companies with significant ties to China have also issued financial warnings, includingand  What comes next?  Much depends on whether the coronavirus continues to spread.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, told reporters Friday that there's great concern about the potential for the coronavirus to spread beyond China. There's still time to contain the virus, Ghebreyesus cautioned, "but the window of opportunity is narrowing."  Coronavirus cases in South Korea, a major producer of the memory chips used in smartphones, have jumped from about 28 a week ago to more than 200. Singapore has reported 86 cases, while Iran said Friday that the virus has spread to several cities.  The International Monetary Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said in a blog post this week that the organization expects a severe drop in China's first quarter economic growth, but "only a small reduction for the entire year" if the spread of the virus is quickly contained.  A longer lasting and more severe outbreak will result in a sharper slowdown, with "more substantial supply chain disruptions and a more persistent drop in investor confidence," she warned.  If the coronavirus outbreak becomes a global pandemic, $1 trillion could be wiped off the world economy, with recessions in the United States and the eurozone, according to economists at Oxford Economics. A pandemic limited to Asia would knock some $400 billion off global GDP in 2020.  For now, demand around the world is "holding up quite well," while measures to contain the virus in China appear to be working, giving companies reason to be optimistic, said John Stopford, head of multi-asset income at Investec Asset Management.  "The consensus view is that these kinds of shocks tend to have a short-term impact but then most of that is recovered," he told CNN Business.  At the same time, prolonged shutdowns in China or an increase in cases outside the country could cause longer term disruption, Stopford said. "The longer it goes on, the incrementally worse the consequences become. If Chinese production is out for two quarters rather than one, the impact on businesses will be much more material."  The response of the Chinese government is another unknown. It has already stepped in to cushion the blow to the domestic economy through fiscal stimulus and subsidies, and may step up measures to contain the fallout.  Stocks at risk?  While stock markets are starting to price in the impact of measures to contain the virus, they are not accounting for the considerable uncertainty that still surrounds the outbreak, said Alastair George, investment strategist at Edison Investment Research.  "We believe that markets are underplaying the risk of a rise in coronavirus-related pneumonia in nations outside China, and the impact of resulting control measures," he added. "There is the risk of a correction if measures to contain the virus spread outside China."  That risk is exacerbated by the fact that equity market valuations in the United States and continental Europe are on the expensive side, George told CNN Business.  Goldman Sachs's Oppenheimer also cautioned that stock prices may not be reflecting the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings.  "Notably, a dash for government bonds, which remain at their yield lows for the year, and precious metals, suggest at least some investors are seeking protection from a decline in global growth expectations," George said.

Russia  Intelligence officials warned lawmakers that Russia is already trying to interfere in the 2020 election to help President Trump win, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Aside from helping Trump get re-elected, Russia is also trying to raise questions about the integrity of the election process, one of the sources said. News of the briefing didn't go over well with Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed Russia's efforts to interfere in US elections and has dismissed findings by US intelligence agencies. The President was furious when he found out that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat and frequent critic, was included — he believed that Schiff would try to use the information against him as he runs for re-election, according to a person familiar with the matter. Then earlier this week, Trump announced he was replacing the acting intelligence chief with someone who had no related experience.  2.

A few months before that, Iranian leadership responded to anti-government protests in the country with a brutal crackdown. Today's election is expected to show how far the highest powers in Iran have moved from current President Hassan Rouhani's modernizing agenda in favor of conservatives and hardliners. There will be few moderates for Iranians to vote for, after thousands of candidates were disqualified from running. That suggests that the Iranian establishment is in no mood to re-engage with the West any time soon. The results will most likely be a big win for conservative and hardline candidates.

2020-02-21	(CNN) Weeks after the novel coronavirus crisis began in December, there is still widespread confusion over the exact number of cases reported in China and whether the epidemic is finally stabilizing at the outbreak's epicenter of Hubei province.  On Thursday, China announced just 394 new confirmed cases, the lowest number of daily infections reported in weeks. But on Friday, the confirmed number of cases in mainland China increased to 889, according to the country's National Health Commission.  This fluctuation could be partly down to a change this week in what is counted as a "confirmed case" in Hubei province, the epicenter of the global outbreak.  Here's what we know.  How has China changed its method?  Last week, Hubei province announced it would count "clinically diagnosed" cases in its numbers. These were patients who demonstrated all the symptoms of Covid-19 but either had not been able to get a test or were believed to have falsely tested negative.  Hubei doctors could use CT scans to confirm such coronavirus infections without a test.  That decision saw confirmed cases in Hubei province soar, with more than 15,152 new infections announced in mainland China on February 12 alone.  Officials said the move to include clinically diagnosed patients was intended to help clear a backlog of suspected cases in Hubei.  But on Thursday the government guidelines changed and "clinically confirmed" were excluded from the tally of confirmed cases.  Now patients must have a positive lab test result to be counted in the tally. Other cases will be listed as "suspected."  The World Health Organization (WHO) reacted to the change in their Friday situation report, noting: "Some previously reported 'clinically diagnosed' cases are thus expected to be discarded over the coming days as laboratory testing is conducted and some are found to be Covid-19-negative."  Adding to the confusion is that on Friday, Hubei health authorities announced another new development.  Tu Yuanchao, deputy director of Hubei Health Committee, said at a press conference that the provincial government has banned the practice of reducing the number of already confirmed cases.  Tu said that all the cases that were confirmed but then retroactively dismissed as they no longer fitted the reporting requirements would be added back to the total tally.  "These adjustments in numbers have attracted huge public attention, caused some doubts about the data. As a result, Ying Yong, secretary of the provincial Party committee, attached great importance to this issue. He explicitly ordered that no subtraction be allowed for already-confirmed cases and all subtractions be added back," Tu said.  Why has China done this?  China cited improved testing capacity of the novel coronavirus as the reason for changing the way confirmed cases are counted in Hubei province, officials said Thursday.  Wang Guiqiang, director of the Society of Infectious Diseases of the Chinese Medical Association, said: "In order to resolve the conflict between diagnosis and treatment, in Hubei, such clinical diagnosis was introduced to enable timely treatment of possible patients and reduce fatality rate.  "But now that the situation in Hubei has changed. The nucleic acid testing capability has been greatly improved. And now all suspected cases or unconfirmed cases can be tested for nucleic acids quickly. Nucleic acid testing is no longer an issue."  Nucleaic acids -- such as DNA -- are the main information-carrying molecules of the cell. Nucleic acid tests analyze swabs taken from a patient's saliva or mucus and look for the genetic materials of the virus.  However, scientists have pointed to problems with the nucleic acid test producing false negatives, meaning infected patients could be going undetected.  There are also reports in parts of China that a shortage of testing kits and inaccurate results are leading to long delays in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients.  What experts say  The WHO has previously voiced support for the way China is counting coronavirus infections, and said Thursday it was encouraged by the drop in reported cases.  Some experts, however -- including a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner -- have expressed skepticism over taking China's figures at face value, given the government's track record of suppressing information about this epidemic and previous ones.  But David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto, said the way that officials define cases of a virus often evolves as their understanding of the illness develops.  "One could change a case definition for sort of nefarious reasons to create the illusion that the epidemic is getting better. In this case, China did exactly the opposite," he said. "They broadened their case definition when they needed to, in order not to miss cases, and now that things are under control they're narrowing it down again to make it consistent to easier to keep track of what's really going on."  But Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and visiting scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said to change track twice in one week was "very unusual."  "It's very confusing to see true trends and makes elucidating them complicated," Feigl-Ding continued. "Did (the cases) really decrease or is it because you've been not reporting this the last few days?"  Experts have also questioned the reliability of China relying solely on the lab test.  "There's evidence that people don't test positive until much later in the in the disease course,' said Feigl-Ding.  Asymptomatic cases not counted in China  China's decision to not count patients who have tested positive in the lab but haven't shown any symptoms has also raised eyebrows.  This differs from the reporting practice of countries around the world, said Feigl-Ding.  For example, 11 Americans who were flown back to the US from Japan last week tested positive for the virus but showed no symptoms. Those asymptomatic patients are counted as confirmed cases in the US, but if they were in China they would not be.  "It's extremely frustrating," said Feigl-Ding, who said attempting to count the number of global cases with such a discrepancy, "becomes an apples and oranges situation."  He urged China to report how many lab-positive asymptomatic patients it has, as failing to do so prevent "for international comparisons."  The US Centers for Disease and Control has said that asymptomatic patients can still be contagious and spread the virus.

At a press conference on Thursday, the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that although data from China showed a decline in new infections, this was no time for complacency.  Experts have warned there could be a renewed increase in cases once China properly returns to work -- hundreds of millions of people around the country have been on lockdown for weeks now.  Smaller outbreaks continue to expand elsewhere, including on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, where two deaths were confirmed Thursday, the first from the hundreds of cases on the ship, which has begun disembarking passengers after a 14-day quarantine this week. There have been 78 cases confirmed with no connection to the ship, raising concerns of a self-sustaining outbreak in the country.  On Friday, South Korea recorded an additional 52 additional cases overnight, bringing its total to 156.  In Singapore the infection rate continues to climb, with 85 confirmed cases. Similarly, in Hong Kong, there are 68 confirmed cases, and two deaths.

Stringer/AFP/Getty Images  The Hubei health authority reported that 96 more people died of the coronavirus in China's Hubei province on Saturday, February 22, raising the death toll in the outbreak's epicenter to 2,346.  Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 630 cases of the virus in Hubei on Saturday, including 32 cases in prison. The total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak is now 64,084.  There are 40,127 patients hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,845 who are in critical condition, according to the health authority, and 15,299 patients have been discharged.  The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,441. The global death toll is at least 2,458, with 17 deaths outside of mainland China. Iran has reported five deaths from the coronavirus, while Japan has reported three deaths, and Hong Kong, Italy and South Korea reach reported two deaths. Taiwan, the Philippines, and France have each reported one death.  The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 78,572, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.  China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later today.
2020-02-22	Public health officials in Ontario, Canada, have confirmed a new "presumptive positive case" of the novel coronavirus.  The case involves a woman who arrived in Canada from China on Friday, the Ontario Ministry of Health said in a news release. She had an "intermittent cough that was improving," the news release said, but she went to the emergency department at North York General Hospital in Toronto at the advice of Telehealth Ontario.  Laboratory testing indicated the patient was "presumptive positive" for the coronavirus, the news release said. Officials are awaiting final confirmation from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.  The patient was discharged and is in self-isolation, the news release said. Officials said there was a low risk that the patient was infectious, and she's had limited exposure to other people since she arrived in Canada. Provincial officials are working to contact airplane passengers who might have been in close proximity to the patient.  Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health said:  "Because of all the proper protocols and procedures that are in place to contain this virus and exposure to others was limited, I want to assure the public that the risk to Ontarians remains low. Protecting the health and well-being of individuals and families across the province remains our top priority and we continue to vigilantly monitor for and contain any and all new cases."  Canada had nine confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Friday, according to the country's Public Health Agency.
2020-02-22	Hong Kong (CNN) Concerns are growing over the global spread of the novel coronavirus after a spike in cases outside of mainland China among people with no connection to China or the city of Wuhan, ground zero for the outbreak.  World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that there was still a chance to contain the virus, "but the window of opportunity is narrowing."  The WHO has called on countries to continue containment measures while preparing for community transmission, he said, adding that the outbreak could still go in any direction.  "We must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have," he said.  His words come as countries outside of China report a sharp increase of coronavirus cases -- particularly in South Korea and IranItaly has also reported two deaths, raising fears of self-sustaining epidemics.  Authorities in China's Hubei province confirmed an additional 366 cases of the virus on Friday, 45 fewer than the previous day, taking the total number of cases at the epicenter of the outbreak to over 63,400. The total number of cases in mainland China is now more than 76,200.  The global death toll from the outbreak has reached 2,372, after 109 deaths were reported in mainland China Friday, including 106 in Hubei, nine fewer than the previous day.  Outside of mainland China, at least 17 people have died from the coronavirus, including five people in Iran.  More than 9,000 self-isolating in South Korea  Outside China, the largest coronavirus outbreaks have been in South Korea and Japan, where hundreds of people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarking passengers this week from Yokohama Bay.  On Saturday, South Korea reported a spike of more than 229 additional cases in 24 hours, bringing the country's total to over 433, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  The number of cases in South Korea has soared from 28 a week ago. Two patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the country, where the outbreak is centered around the southern city of Daegu.  More than half of the country's cases are linked to the Shincheongji religious group in Daegu . On Saturday, South Korean health officials said that 9,300 members of the group will be tested and required to self-isolate as they try to get on top of the outbreak there.  "We have secured a list of about 9,300 members of the relevant religious group, and we are preemptively enforcing self-isolation and facility isolation," said Kim Gang-lip, South Korea's vice minister of health, at a press briefing.  More than 4,400 people from the list are already self-isolating and the ministry is conducting the first tests on 544 people who said they have respiratory symptoms, Kim said.  In a statement released online on Friday, the Shincheongji religious group said it "deeply regrets" the coronavirus outbreak that occurred in their Daegu branch and said it was cooperating with local authorities.  "Currently all of our church branches in the nation, including the main headquarters have stopped services, gatherings, and mission activity in churches and related spaces," the statement said.  On Friday, the South Korean government designated Daegu and neighboring city Cheongdo as "special management areas" for infectious disease and have taken additional measures to control the outbreak, including shutting down public places in the capital, Seoul.  Cases rise in Middle East  Attention has also turned to Iran, which only recently began reporting its first cases. On Saturday the health ministry confirmed 15 new infections and one death, state news agency IRNA reported.  Iranian health officials said the source of the virus in the country could be a Chinese worker who works in the city of Qom, about 140 kilometers (87 miles) south of the capital Tehran, and had recently traveled to China.  In total, five people have died in the country and 28 infections have been confirmed. Officials warned the coronavirus may have spread to every city in the country.  "The spread of the coronavirus started in Qom and has reached other cities in the country like Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan, Rasht and other cities due to people traveling. There is a possibility that it exists in all cities across the country," said Minnou Mohraz, a member of the National Committee for Infectious Diseases at the Ministry of Health.  On Friday, Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, suggested further investigation was needed after a Canadian tested positive for the virus after returning from Iran. There was no indication that the patient had been to Qom.  "Any important cases linked to Iran could be an indicator that there is more widespread transmission than we know about," Tam said.  Iran's sudden jump in cases, Tam said, was a reminder that the novel coronavirus is a global issue and that there is the possibility that the virus could be present in countries that may not have the capacity to detect or contain it.  On Friday, Lebanon and Israel both reported their first cases of coronavirus.  Leaving the Diamond Princess  Meanwhile, hundreds of people are finally disembarking the Diamond Princess cruise ship that has been quarantined in Japan's Yokohama for the past two weeks.  On Friday, 253 people who tested negative for coronavirus left the ship, according to a news release from the Japanese health ministry. The disembarkation of passengers from the ship will continue at least through Saturday, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told CNN.  Japan, however, reported 12 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, including three teenagers, bringing the number of cases in the country with no connection to the ship to 99, with 639 confirmed from the cruise ship.  Cases have also increased in Singapore and Taiwan.  In the United States, officials have confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That includes 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 14 other US cases.  The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China.  The CDC said it will now track confirmed cases in two separate groups: people who have been repatriated, and those identified by the US public health network.
2020-02-22	(CNN) More than half of South Korea's novel coronavirus cases are linked to a branch of a controversial religious group in the southern city of Daegu.  At least 231 of the country's 433 confirmed cases are associated with the Shincheonji religious group, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC).  The total number of cases reported in South Korea in the past 24 hours stands at 229, after 142 new cases were confirmed overnight.  Around 9,300 Shincheonji members are being put into self-isolation and will be tested, the country's Ministry of Health and Welfare said Saturday.  The Shincheonji is centered around the personality of its founder and chairman, Lee Man-hee. On a website believed to be the group's official homepage, the group heavily suggests that Lee is the "Promised Pastor" mentioned in the Bible. The passage it highlights suggests that the Promised Pastor is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Read More
2020-02-23	Hong Kong/London (CNN Business) Stock markets plunged around the world Monday after the number of coronavirus cases surged in Italy and South Korea, putting two more major economies at risk from a virus that has already caused widespread disruption in China.  Dow INDU Theclosed 1,032 points, or 3.6%, lower, marking its worst day in two years, when it closed down more than 1,000 points twice within a week as inflation fears gripped Wall Street . On February 5 and again on February 8, 2018, the Dow's percentage drop was more than 4% on both days.  Since the index is higher now, on a percentage basis Monday's selloff isn't as dramatic as other drops in the Dow's history.

2020-02-23	Public health officials in Ontario, Canada, have confirmed a new "presumptive positive case" of the novel coronavirus.  The case involves a woman who arrived in Canada from China on Friday, the Ontario Ministry of Health said in a news release. She had an "intermittent cough that was improving," the news release said, but she went to the emergency department at North York General Hospital in Toronto at the advice of Telehealth Ontario.  Laboratory testing indicated the patient was "presumptive positive" for the coronavirus, the news release said. Officials are awaiting final confirmation from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.  The patient was discharged and is in self-isolation, the news release said. Officials said there was a low risk that the patient was infectious, and she's had limited exposure to other people since she arrived in Canada. Provincial officials are working to contact airplane passengers who might have been in close proximity to the patient.  Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health said:  "Because of all the proper protocols and procedures that are in place to contain this virus and exposure to others was limited, I want to assure the public that the risk to Ontarians remains low. Protecting the health and well-being of individuals and families across the province remains our top priority and we continue to vigilantly monitor for and contain any and all new cases."  Canada had nine confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Friday, according to the country's Public Health Agency.
2020-02-23	Hong Kong (CNN) Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned the novel coronavirus is the worst public health crisis facing the country since its founding, as new outbreaks continued to expand in South Korea and Italy , raising fears of a global pandemic.  Speaking Sunday, Xi said the "current epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and the prevention and control work is at the most critical stage." The crisis is "the most difficult to prevent and control in China" since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Xi said. He added the outbreak was likely to have a "great impact" on the country's economy, but that epidemic prevention and control methods were beginning to have an effect.  Following Xi's address, China announced it would delay the annual gathering of nearly 3,000 national legislators in Beijing, according to state media on Monday, underscoring the continuing impact and severity of the outbreak.  The National People's Congress's Standing Committed voted to delay the full session of the (NPC), the country's rubber-stamp parliament, which had been scheduled to start on March 5. No new date has been announced.  As of Monday, there were at least 77,150 confirmed cases in mainland China, bringing the global total to  more than 79,000, with the death toll at 2,620.  A total of 27 of those deaths have occurred outside of mainland China, a major spike from a week ago, when only five deaths had taken place outside China, and most of those involving people who had a direct link to the country.  Major new outbreaks are also now developing in South Korea, Iran and Italy, with dozens of confirmed cases and multiple deaths.  South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that 70 additional coronavirus cases have been confirmed, bringing the country's total to 833.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the country was at a "watershed moment" Sunday, as he issued the highest level of national alert and ordered new resources to tackling the outbreak, which is largely focused on the southern city of Daegu but has spread throughout the East Asian country, including among the military.  The Ministry of Defense of South Korea confirmed Monday that an additional four soldiers had been confirmed to have contracted the virus, bringing the total of military personnel to 11. There are fears that the outbreak could spread quickly among troops living in close confines, and potentially spread to US forces stationed in Korea.  'Witch hunt'  In the South Korean city of Daegu, the outbreak has been centered around the Shincheonji religious group  Some 300 members of the group have tested positive for the virus, and more than 9,000 practitioners have been put into self-isolation while they are tested by health authorities. The infection is believed to have spread rapidly because of the mass worship sessions the group holds, which puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time.  A Christian-inspired new religious movement centered around the personality of its founder and chairman, Lee Man-hee, the outbreak has brought intense scrutiny and no small amount of hostility on the group. Of those South Koreans who identify as religious , more than 60% belong to a mainstream Christian denomination.  Kim So-il, a project director at Shincheonji, compared the recent criticism of the group to a "19th century witch-hunt."  "It's unfair that all people rebuke Shincheonji," he told CNN, adding that the group was in "great difficulty" right now."  Speaking Sunday, a Shincheonji representative told reporters that practitioners are the "biggest victims" of the virus, and urged people to "refrain from hate and groundless attack."  Police in Daegu said Sunday that they had deployed about 600 officers to locate the 670 members of the Shincheonji religious group whose whereabouts are unknown. Officers were visiting their registered addresses and using telecommunications service providers' location tracking information, police said.  According to the South Korean law on the prevention of infectious diseases, health authorities are able to seek help from police and telecommunication service providers are obliged to provide information when requested by the police.  The virus has spread beyond the Shincheonji members, however, with separate outbreaks in a hospital near Daegu, as well as among the country's military. As of Monday, more than 760 cases had been confirmed nationwide, and seven deaths.  JUST WATCHED Chinese authorities putting healthy people in field hospitals Replay More Videos ...

Authorities in Italy announced sweeping closures across the country's north and emergency measures Sunday as they scrambled to contain Europe's largest outbreak. More than 130 cases have been confirmed in Italy so far, and three deaths.  "We still cannot identify patient zero, so it's difficult to forecast possible new cases," Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's Civil Protection agency, said at a Sunday news conference.  Strict emergency measures were put in place over the weekend, including a ban on public events in 10 municipalities, after a spike in confirmed cases in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.  Italy's Health Minister Roberto Speranza announced severe restrictions in the affected regions, which included the closure of public buildings, limited transport, and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.  "We are asking basically that everyone who has come from areas stricken by the epidemic to remain under a mandatory house stay," Speranza said at a Saturday press conference.  Italy's top soccer league, Serie A, canceled at least three games scheduled to be played in Lombardy and Veneto regions.  The country's fashion capital, Milan, announced it would close its schools starting Monday for a week.

"Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case," he said.  The increase in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy "is also a matter of concern and how the virus is now spreading to other parts of the world," Tedros added.  Members of the G20, currently meeting in Saudi Arabia, warned that the coronavirus poses the greatest risk to the global economy.  "Global economic growth remains slow and downside risks to the outlook persist, including those arising from geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty. We will enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of Covid-19. We stand ready to take further action to address these risks," according to the final document of the conference.  The host of the G20 meeting, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, said that countries will be ready to act on the risk coronavirus poses to commerce.  "We all agreed that all countries and states will be ready to intervene as needed to face these risks and it'll be a multilateral intervention including the WHO (World Health Organization) to monitor these risks and use relevant policies as needed," Jadaan said.
2020-02-23	Rome (CNN) Italian authorities have announced sweeping closures in the country's north as they scramble to contain Europe's biggest outbreak of the novel coronavirus.  Italy's confirmed cases surged from three on Friday morning to more than 200 by Monday.  Five people have died and at least 219 others have been infected with the virus in Italy, Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's Civil Protection agency, said at a Monday news conference.  The bulk of the cases (167) are in the northern region of Lombardy, whose capital is the city of Milan.  Borrelli added that one person had recovered and that 91 people with the virus were currently in isolation at home.  Officials have yet to track down the first carrier of the virus in the country. "We still cannot identify patient zero, so it's difficult to forecast possible new cases," Borrelli said at an earlier press conference.  Strict emergency measures were put in place over the weekend, including a ban on public events in at least 10 municipalities, after a spike in confirmed cases in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.  Italy's Health Minister Roberto Speranza announced severe restrictions in the affected regions, which included the closure of public buildings, limited transport, and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.  "We are asking basically that everyone who has come from areas stricken by the epidemic to remain under a mandatory house stay," Speranza said at a Saturday press conference.  Nearby countries within the borderless Schengen Area that covers most of western Europe have gotten jittery over the spike in Italy's numbers.  A train from Italy was stopped at the Austrian border on Sunday evening when two German women on board reported fever symptoms, public broadcaster ORF said. The train was let through after the women tested negative for the virus.  Austrian authorities said they would meet on Monday to study the situation and analyze if border controls with Italy were necessary.  Sports and fashion affected  Italy's top soccer league, Serie A, canceled at least four matches scheduled to be played in Lombardy and Veneto regions.  Atalanta versus Sassuolo, Hellas Verona versus Cagliari, Torino versus Parma, and Inter Milan versus Sampdoria were suspended, according to Serie A's website on Sunday.  The country's fashion capital, Milan, announced it would close its schools starting Monday for a week. School trips inside and outside Italy were also being canceled from Sunday, according to a statement by Italy's Ministry of Education.  The spike in numbers has also affected the end of Milan Fashion Week.  Fashion houses Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti confirmed to CNN that they will be holding Sunday's fashion shows with no spectators and behind closed doors.  Venice Carnival is being suspended in the face of the outbreak, Luca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto region, announced Sunday.  Two of the region's 25 cases occurred in Venice, the popular tourist destination whose carnival celebrations attract visitors from across the world.  Zaia also announced a ban on public and private meetings, and closures of schools, universities and museums in the region.  "We ask for the cooperation of all citizens. It's not an easy moment. But, with the data we have today, we can still hope to limit the contagion," Zaia said.  As worries grow in Italy's north, authorities in the country's south put a migrant rescue ship in quarantine in Sicily, the interior ministry said Sunday.  The Ocean Viking, which has 274 migrants aboard who were rescued at sea, is quarantined in Pozzallo, Sicily, along with the ship's crew.  'Window of opportunity is narrowing'  The situation has raised fears about the spike in cases outside mainland China among people with no connection to China or the city of Wuhan -- ground zero for the outbreak.  World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated on Saturday that there was still a chance to contain the virus beyond China, "but the window of opportunity is narrowing."  "Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case," he said.  The increase in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy "is also a matter of concern and how the virus is now spreading to other parts of the world," Tedros added.
2020-02-24	London (CNN Business) The emergence of hundreds of coronavirus cases in two major economies outside China has dashed hopes of a speedy recovery from an epidemic that has already wreaked havoc on global supply chains and hit company profits .  The number of infections in South Korea, a major producer of cars, electronics and machinery, has shot up to more than 890. Italy, which started the weekend with a handful of cases, now has over 270 and seven confirmed deaths. Officials have shut down public buildings, schools and sports events in some parts of the country's industrial north.  With Japan already reporting hundreds of infections, four of the world's top 12 economies — representing about27% of global GDP — are now scrambling to contain the virus. A fifth — Germany — is teetering on the brink of recession  The spike in cases outside China signals a new phase in the battle against coronavirus, greater risk for companies and their workers, and global economic growth.  It may not be called a health pandemic yet but it is an economic pandemic."  Officials and business leaders had been hoping that dramatic action taken by China would slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent it from gaining traction around the world.  If China's factories were able to restart production quickly after an extended shutdown, the world's second largest economy would have a chance to return to normal in the second quarter.  Under that scenario, global growth this year would only be 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said over the weekend. The IMF boss cautioned, however, that she was also looking at "more dire scenarios" where the outbreak turns out to be "more persistent and widespread."  Economic damage  Stock markets, which had so far largely brushed off the threat from coronavirus, are now reflecting the growing risk of a much bigger hit to the global economy.  The sharp increase in infections in Italy and South Korea, the world's eighth and twelfth largest economies, produced a sharp reaction from investors. South Korea's benchmark share index closed down nearly 3.9% on Monday, its worst day since October 2018. In Italy, the main market index closed down more than 5%. The Dow lost 1,031 points, or 3.6%, its worst day in two years.  Reduced demand for goods and services, and factory closures in China, were already expected to slam Chinese growth in the first quarter, weigh on trade and slow global growth. But the spread of the virus increases the risk of substantial damage to economies that were growing at a much slower place than China — or, as in the cases of Germany, Italy and Japan, already at risk of recession.  "When the virus was limited to China and other nearby countries, it was viewed as an economic issue for Asia," said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James. "The spread of the virus into Italy now makes this a European issue and possibly a global issue that could upset the supply chain for months or years to come."  Italy's economy contracted by 0.3% in the final three months of 2019, compared to the previous quarter, and some economists were expecting the country to fall into recession early this year before the coronavirus outbreak escalated.  Fiat Chrysler FCAU The bulk of cases in Italy are in the northern region of Lombardy, whose capital is the financial center of Milan. Turin, which is home to, is located to the west of Milan, while other carmakers including Ferrari are situated to its southeast. Milan is also home to many luxury goods makers, and the city just hosted its annual fashion week.  Officials have yet to track down the first carrier of the virus in Italy. Restrictions designed to stop the spread of coronavirus in the country affect about 100,000 people.  The coronavirus is also hiking the risk of recession in other countries. The economy of Japan, which has reported 840 cases, including 691 from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, shrank 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the country was slammed by a sales tax hike and a powerful typhoon. Another quarter of contraction will put the world's third biggest economy into recession.  Germany, the biggest economy in Europe and number four in the world, ground to a halt right before the coronavirus outbreak set in, dragged down by the country's struggling factories. German companies rely on China to buy cars and other products, and economists at Berenberg bank said Monday they now expect the economy to contract in the first quarter of 2020. Official data published Tuesday confirmed GDP did not grow in the final three months of 2019.  A worker sprays disinfectant to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Seoul.  South Korea is also in a vulnerable position.  Exports to China, its largest market, were positive in December for the first time in 14 months. But research firm Oxford Economics expects both exports and industrial production to suffer because of the outbreak in China.  Hyundai HYMTF It warned that South Korean electronics, autos and electrical equipment makers could struggle to get the parts they need from China to keep their factories running.has already been forced to stop production at plants in South Korea because of parts shortages.  And because people are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick, consumer demand could suffer in South Korea. President Moon Jae-in said the country was at a "watershed moment" Sunday, as he issued the highest level of national alert and ordered new resources to tackle the outbreak.  A global issue  Apple AAPL A slew of companies includinghave warned that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting sales or profit targets for the first three months of the year. But many of the financial projections assumed the coronavirus would be contained to China.  The International Air Transport Association, fogr example, warned last week that coronavirus could cost global carriers nearly $30 billion in lost revenue. Global demand would drop by 4.7%, the first decline since the financial crisis.  The group's estimate was based, however, on the disruption caused by SARS when it ripped through China in 2003. That virus caused real economic damage over a period of months, including for airlines, but the sharp decline in activity was "followed by an equally quick recovery," according to IATA.  "We don't yet know exactly how the [current] outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not," IATA warned.  The continued spread of the novel coronavirus makes the SARS comparison increasingly tenuous.  Major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis, and global debt levels have never been higher. Those factors could limit the response by policymakers around the world.  Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Monday on Twitter that there is a growing consensus among economists that the US Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month, in response to the coronavirus.  "It may not be called a health pandemic yet but it is an economic pandemic," she said.
2020-02-24	The US Food and Drug Administration is currently not able to conduct routine inspections on drugs, medical supplies or household goods from China due the US State Department’s travel advisory for China over the coronavirus outbreak, the agency said in a statement.  Inspections are just one tool the FDA uses to make sure products are safe, and the lack of inspections is “not hindering our efforts to monitor medical products and food safety,” officials said. The agency monitors products through import screening, sampling and import alerts and it works with US Customs and Border Protection to look for products that violate legal requirements. Some 60% of FDA-regulated products imported from China are medical devices, the agency said, and 20% are housewares, such as food packaging.  In response to the outbreak, the FDA said it will also use, where appropriate, the agency’s authority to request records from firms “in advance or in lieu of” drug surveillance inspections in China. Paper records will help prioritize what inspections should happen first during what could become a back log in on-the-ground inspections, depending on how long the travel restrictions continue, the agency said.  The FDA reiterated that there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through imported goods, but added that this is a “dynamic” situation and the agency will continue to assess it and update guidance as needed.  The FDA promised it is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate any coronavirus-related issues in a collaborative effort with other agencies.
2020-02-24	Washington (CNN) The United States and South Korea are considering scaling back upcoming joint military exercises due to the coronavirus outbreak in the Korean Peninsula, according to US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.  Esper said the US commander of US forces in Korea, Gen. Robert Abrams, and South Korea's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Park Han-ki, "are looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus."  Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon alongside his South Korean counterpart, Minister of Defense Kyeong-doo Jeong, Esper said he is confident the US and South Korea will "remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together."  The South Korean defense minister, speaking through a translator, said that "due to the coronavirus in Korea, the situation is quite serious," saying that the US-South Korean military leadership "will make the right decision through close coordination" with regard to the command post exercise.  He said that there were 13 confirmed cases of coranavirus among South Korean military personnel.  Read More

2020-02-24	New York (CNN Business) Fear has returned to Wall Street. The spread of coronavirus cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea is shaking investors out of their recent complacency.  Investors are nervous that the global economy will slow dramatically in the first quarter because of coronavirus. And they are piling into classic safe haven fear trades as a result and shunning anything that seems risky.  Long-term bond rates are falling sharply as worries about a recession increase. The 30-year US Treasury yield is at an all-time low and the 10-year is not far from its 2016 record low of 1.32%. The price of US oil fell 5%. And the US dollar is near a 52-week high.  and, which both pay dividends that yield substantially more than Treasury bonds, were the only two Dow stocks trading higher Monday morning. Several high-yielding real estate investment trust and utilities were among the 30 S&P 500 stocks trading higher. So was wipe maker  VIX VIX The, a measure of market volatility that usually spikes when investors are scared, surged nearly 45% Monday and is nearing a 52-week high. And the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index , which measures the VIX and six other gauges of investor sentiment, fell into Fear territory Friday for the first time since October. It edged closer to Extreme Fear Monday.  As a result of the market panic, experts are starting to wonder if the Federal Reserve and other central banks will soon be forced to cut interest rates even further.  "Investors are starting the week on the back foot and no one is ready to risk big. Traders are anxious about the global economic growth number for the first quarter," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with AvaTrade, in a report. "Central banks will be pushed in the corner due to the global economic meltdown caused by coronavirus and this mean more stimulus."  Traders are now pricing in a nearly 25% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in March, according to futures contracts tracked by the CME. That's up from just 11% on Friday and less than 4% a month ago.  "The coronavirus represents the most uncertain macro risk markets have faced in years," said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research with FTSE Russell, in a report Monday. "As the virus spreads to Europe, the threat to global growth moves beyond China and the global supply chain and now directly threatens the heart of European manufacturing."  Young added that "investors are also acutely aware that many misjudged the economic severity of the virus early on, making them more open to entertaining worst-case scenarios now."  The stock market sell-off and rush into safer assets may be just beginning, especially if the Fed and other central banks move to lower rates.  "The coronavirus is going to be a headwind to global growth. The remedy may be that central banks have to step in with more stimulus," said Everett Millman, a precious metals specialist at Gainesville Coins, in an interview with CNN Business.  Millman added that gold prices, now trading around $1,675 an ounce, could easily top $1,800 later this year and approach 2011's all-time high of more than $1,900. He added that bitcoin, which has been soaring this year, could rally further as well, since "borderless money" will have more appeal if the outbreak intensifies.

But so far, moderate voters haven't united around a single candidate, making it harder to slow him down. The next nine days will determine whether Sanders' revolution will be able to help him clinch the nomination.  JUST WATCHED Bernie Sanders celebrates Nevada caucus win Replay More Videos ...

Russia  A top election security official appears to have overstated the US intelligence community's formal assessment of Russian interference in the 2020 election. Shelby Pierson told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was trying to help Trump get re-elected. Now, three national security officials say she omitted some important nuance. Russia is interfering in the 2020 election and it does view President Trump as a leader it can work with, according to US intelligence. But the US doesn't have evidence that Russia is interfering specifically to help Trump — right now, Russia's only clear aim is to sow discord in the US, one official said. Separately, intelligence officials have warned Bernie Sanders that Russia is trying to boost him in the Democratic primaries, though they have not determined that Russia wants him to win the general election.

2020-02-24	New York (CNN Business) Apple dropped a bombshell last week. Yet Wall Street, in the throes of a historic meltup, reacted with a collective shrug.  America's most valuable company warned investors onFebruary 17 that its sales would miss the mark because of chaos caused by the coronavirus outbreak in China.  Yet investors, betting the coronavirus storm would soon pass, plowed into tech stocks, sending the Nasdaq to a record high the next day. By February 19, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation metric, climbed to new cycle highs.  That cautious optimism has since been abandoned.  Coronavirus fears sent the Dow plummeting 1,000 points, or 3.4%, on Monday. The index has now lost more than 1,300 points in the span of just three trading days. The wave of selling wiped has out the Dow's gains for the year.  The episode shows how complacent investors became about the threat the coronavirus poses to the fragile world economy. That attitude left stocks vulnerable to a market freakout like the one gripping Wall Street now.  "Many misjudged the economic severity of the virus early on, making them more open to entertaining worst-case scenarios now," Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, wrote in a note to clients Monday.  Part of that misjudgment could be due to the fact that this is a health crisis, not just an economic one.  "There's a lack of understanding about the impact of the coronavirus because investors aren't typically health experts," said Kristina Hooper, chief global strategist at Invesco. "And even the health experts can't tell us much about the disease."  'Free-fall'  Carnival CCL Royal Caribbean RCL American Airlines AAL Delta DAL Tourism stocks retreated sharply Monday.andlost 7% apiece.anddropped even more.  "In many ways, this is worse than the tariff wars," said Hooper. She noted that while the damage from the US-China trade war was limited to manufacturing, the coronavirus scare is impacting the far larger service sector.  It's not just US stocks getting hammered. South Korea's Kospi plummeted nearly 4%, its worst day since October 2018. Italy's benchmark index got clobbered, losing more than 5%.  The hope last week had been that the coronavirus was largely contained to China. While that would certainly deal a blow to the world's No. 2 economy, it could limit the damage to the global economy. However, the latest developments suggest that optimism was misplaced.  The coronavirus has spread, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy taking place in recent days. That has deeply negative implications for airlines, hotels, restaurants and other consumer companies.  "Global equities are in a bit of a free-fall this morning," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in Monday report.  Stocks were more expensive than at any point since 2002  The problem is that stocks were priced for perfection. And this is hardly a perfect environment.  Boosted by easy money from global central banks, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio climbed to 19 on February 19, according to FactSet. That's the highest level since May 23, 2002 and well above the 10-year average of 14.9.  Moreover, nine of the market's sectors were sporting P/E ratios that exceeded their 20-year averages, FactSet said.  In other words, markets were due for a correction, as Goldman Sachs presciently warned last week.  "Historically high P/Es can be justified by historically low inflation and interest rates," Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, wrote in a Monday report to clients. "Nevertheless, this meltup is vulnerable to a correction because P/Es are so high."  Valuations are notoriously poor timing mechanisms. That means market valuations can remain stretched for some time before cooling off.  And there were legitimate reasons for bullishness. Recession fears that rocked Wall Street in late 2018 and much of 2019 faded. The US-China trade war has cooled significantly. America's jobs market continues to impress. Even manufacturing is rebounding from the recent downturn.  Yet the coronavirus is doing real damage to the world economy and threatening corporate profits.  Apple AAPL Adidas ADDDF warned that its iPhone sales and manufacturing are being damaged.said its business activity in China plunged 85%. Airlines are bracing for even sharper losses than the $7 billion lost during the 2003 SARS outbreak.  "We've had this 2020 that has been absolutely insane. It's been crazy," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "People want to take profits while they still have some."  When will Wall Street bounce back?  Beyond the coronavirus fears, investors may have begun to turn their attention to the rise of Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Although markets have largely shrugged off the strength of Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist performed much better than anticipated during last weekend's Nevada caucuses.  UnitedHealth UNH Sanders has vowed to be a "nightmare" for both the insurance industry and big banks on Wall Street. Both sectors were weak on Monday, withplunging 7%, making it the worst performer on the Dow.  "The strong performance of Bernie Sanders in Nevada over the weekend isn't helping sentiment for the market either," Bespoke's Hickey wrote.  Even as US stocks marched to record highs last week, warning lights were flashing elsewhere. The bond market in particular started to price in a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Investors plowed into safe haven government bonds, driving the 10-year Treasury yield to levels unseen since 2016.  Investors are also betting that the Federal Reserve will once again come to the rescue of the economy with more easy money. Markets are now pricing in a 95% chance of at least one interest rate cut by the end of 2020, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  The extent of the damage on Wall Street will be defined by the ultimate impact to the underlying economy and corporate profits. And that will depend on how quickly the coronavirus gets under control.  "I don't think we see a recession. This is short-lived," said Invesco's Hooper. "It could very well become a buying opportunity."
2020-02-24	New York (CNN Business) Shares of American biotech firm Gilead Sciences rose nearly 5% Monday after an official from the World Health Organization said that Gilead's drug remdesivir is showing signs that it may be able to help treat the deadly coronavirus.  "There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir," Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference in Beijing.  WHO officials added that clinical trials for remdesivir in humans are now taking place and results could be available within weeks.  Gilead Sciences confirmed in an e-mail to CNN Business that that it is working with health authorities in China on two trials for patients who have been infected with Covid-19, the official name of this particular strain of coronavirus.
2020-02-25	Washington (CNN) The US and South Korea are expected to announce as soon as Tuesday that a critical joint military exercise has been scaled back because the coronavirus outbreak is severely limiting the ability of both nation's militaries to participate, according to three US officials.  This would be the first major impact of coronavirus on US military readiness, according to the officials. Without the full exercise, the US could lose ground in being able to quickly conduct future operations in a coordinated and highly synchronized manner with South Korea against the north in a crisis one of the officials said.  The two sides are discussing the final details of the reduced effort. The command overseeing US forces in Korea, along with the South Korean military, could make an announcement as soon as late Tuesday night in the US, early Wednesday morning in South Korea, the officials said.  The first exercise involved is a so-called command post exercise scheduled to begin in the next several days. These types of exercises simulate the essential ability of top commanders and their senior staffs on both sides practicing precisely how they would operate together in a crisis. In South Korea, this is vital training as both sides would operate jointly in any combat crisis against North Korea.  It is not yet clear if any field exercises will be affected.  Read More
2020-02-25	Investors had been too sanguine on the risk for the coronavirus to dent global growth . Faced with new cases in Italy and South Korea, strains in global supply chains and new profit warnings, investors ran for cover.  In classic risk-off mode, investors sold stocks and bought bonds and gold -- the Dow lost 1,000 points for just the third time in history Monday. Oil prices tumbled on the assumption that a global economy that runs on oil would slow and need less of it. It could mean lower election-year gas prices for consumers, a silver lining in an otherwise scary growth story.  Theand thehave erased their 2020 gains and once high-flying tech stocks were among the hardest hit.  There are closed factories and quarantines in China. Ships are sitting in ports, shipments are idled, goods are floating and waiting for a port. New outbreaks in Italy and South Korea mean 4 of the 12 largest economies are dealing with the virus.  United Airlines made the rare move of withdrawing is guidance for investors. Essentially, it can't say how much money it will make because it has zero visibility into the Asian air travel market . MasterCard warned on sales.  The global supply chain is deeply intertwined with China. From computer chips to lobsters, to wedding dresses and auto parts, expect shortages and disruptions.  Historically, epidemics and pandemics are a short-term hit to markets and then they recover eventually. But hyper-globalization of the past 20 years means history is not a fool-proof guide. This outbreak has surpassed SARS in 2003, when China accounted for just 4% of the world economy. Today China accounts for almost one-fifth of the global activity.  Stocks closing near the lows was a worrisome sign and shows investors were too blasé on the risk. Asian markets could not bounce back overnight and European shares have wobbled in early Tuesday trade.  Key for today: Can US stock index futures stabilize? Do more companies withdraw their guidance? Do other countries pop up with cases? There is no way to know if this is the start of a stock market correction or an overreaction. Much depends on how governments respond.  "The greatest risk to Trump's re-election is a black swan event like this, which could drag down global economic growth and depress corporate earnings," writes chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments Greg Valliere. "At the least, Trump faces softer first half economic growth than an incumbent wants."  In India, the president projected optimism, telling reporters, "We think we're in pretty good shape in the United States." And he played the role of stock market strategist, tweeting that the stock market "looks pretty good" and later warning of doom if he is not elected.  "Our market will jump thousands and thousands of points if I win. If I don't win, you're going to see a crash like you've never seen before."  Impossible to know, but the president continues to use the stock market as his personal approval poll, politicizing the stock market in an election year.
2020-02-25	London (CNN Business) A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here .  By any measure, the stock market's pullback on Monday was dramatic: the S&P 500 lost 3.4%, while the Dow finished 1,032 points, or 3.6%, lower. It was the index's worst day in two years  But it shouldn't have taken Wall Street by surprise. Stocks had continued to reach record highs even as officials struggled to contain the coronavirus' spread, buoyed by a sense that the US economy faced limited exposure and central banks could step in to help ease financial conditions as needed. Meanwhile, the drumbeat of companies warning that the virus would hit their earnings was growing louder, and investors had been piling into the bond market for safety.  That divergence left equity markets vulnerable to a sell-off — especially after outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran made clear that the problem was not contained to China, as many investors had hoped.  "We're coming from pretty lofty levels in the equity markets, so this is definitely giving people some reason to take risk off the table," Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, told me.  Others agreed: "I think people fully understand why the market is down," Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, told me. "I think people fully understand this was a reasonable thing for it to do."  Still, Cox noted that the atmosphere did feel "a little more panicky than normal," as the range of possible outcomes leaves traders on edge.  "There's no middle ground," he said. "[The coronavirus] either dies down, stops in its tracks — or else it gets a lot worse."  Cox believes that after letting off some steam, stocks can keep pushing higher so long as the US job market stays solid. "If you start to see fracturing in the employment outlook in the US, that's when you need to start making adjustments," he said.  Happening now: Japan's Nikkei, which was closed Monday, dropped 3.3% on Tuesday, while stocks in Korea and Hong Kong recovered some of their earlier losses. Markets in Europe continue to fall in early trading. US stocks futures are flat, indicating stability may return, at least for now.  Investors reward drugmakers focusing on coronavirus  Few companies have been shielded from the meltdown in stocks this week. Among the lucky: those that have been working on drugs that could assist with the coronavirus outbreak.  Shares of Moderna, a US biotech firm, rose 2% on Monday and have shot up 17% in premarket trading Tuesday after the company said it had shipped an experimental coronavirus vaccine to US government researchers. Those researchers expect to start a clinical trial involving human testing by the end of April, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Also rising: Gilead Sciences, a much larger US biotech firm. The company's stock rose 4.6% on Monday and is up another 2% in premarket trading. Those gains come after an official from the World Health Organization said that Gilead's drug remdesivir has shown signs that it may be able to help treat patients infected with the new coronavirus.  Investor insight: Gains for the broader health care sector could be limited this year by the US election. Nicholas Colas, founder of DataTrek Research, has called health care "a tough group to like in 2020," despite virus concerns.  "Even if the Democrats end up choosing Michael Bloomberg or another centrist candidate, American health care costs will be a front-and-center issue during this year's campaign season," he wrote in a recent note to clients.  JPMorgan expands restrictions on financing coal mining  JPMorgan Chase — the biggest US bank — is revealing new climate initiatives. On Tuesday, the bank will tell investors that it's expanding restrictions on financing of coal mining and coal-fired power. It will also bar financing of new oil and gas development in the Arctic.  Big picture: The shift comes as banks face growing calls to end financing of carbon-intensive industries, while other companies are beginning to distance themselves from controversial oil projects.  Canadian miner Teck Resources said this week that it would drop plans for an oil sands mine in Alberta. And Norwegian oil company Equinor abandoned plans on Tuesday to drill for oil off the southern coast of Australia, saying that "the opportunity is not commercially competitive." BP and Chevron had already dropped the project.

2020-02-25	Hong Kong (CNN) Public health officials warned Wednesday that the spread of the novel coronavirus is inching closer toward meeting the definition of a global pandemic, as the number of cases outside mainland China continues to grow, including in South Korea where a US soldier has tested positive for the virus.  Brazil announced its first case of coronavirus today, marking the first time the virus has been reported in South America. The outbreak has now spread to six of the world's seven continents . It has not yet reached Antarctica.  Iran and Italy are also grappling with major outbreaks within their borders that have turned deadly, and a top official from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that the United States could see the virus spread within its borders.  "Ultimately we expect we will see community spread in this country. It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  South Korea currently has the largest outbreak outside mainland China, with more than 1,200 people infected -- including the first US soldier -- and at least 12 dead. Iran's health ministry has confirmed at least 139 cases and 19 fatalities. In Italy, at least 374 people have been infected and 12 have been killed, while Algeria, Croatia, mainland Spain and Switzerland all announced their first confirmed cases.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far held off on classifying the coronavirus' spread as a global pandemic , but the outbreak appears to be getting closer to meeting the global health body's definition of one.  The CDC's Messonnier said Tuesday that the situation has met two of the criteria for a pandemic: "the fact that this virus has caused illness -- including illness that has resulted in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread."  "As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus," she said.  To date, the virus has killed more than 2,760 people globally, 2,715 of whom are in mainland China. China's National Health Commission reported that 406 confirmed cases were identified on Tuesday -- all but five in hard-hit Hubei province -- and 52 people were killed by the virus. The total number of people infected in mainland China is now 78,064, bringing the global total to 80,970.  The situation has rattled global markets and led to concern about the long term economic impact of the virus.  Investors and economists have been particularly concerned about how the continued shutdown of factories in China could affect global supply chains, but the new outbreaks in two major economies -- Italy and South Korea -- have rattled markets and dashed hopes of a speedy recovery, sparking this week's worldwide stock rout.

The outbreak began in the southern city of Daegu and was centered around the Shincheonji religious group, but the virus appears to have spread now beyond practitioners.  Twenty members of the South Korean military have been confirmed infected, and the country's defense ministry has placed significant restrictions on soldiers leaving their bases due to fears surrounding the virus. On Wednesday, it was announced that a US service member stationed in South Korea tested positive for the virus, according to US Forces Korea statement.  The soldier, who is stationed at Camp Carroll which is approximately 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the city of Daegu, is the first US service member to test positive for the novel coronavirus.  "The patient, a 23-year old male, is currently in self quarantine at his off-base residence. He visited Camp Walker on 24 February and Camp Carroll 21-25 February. KCDC and USFK health professionals are actively conducting contact tracing to determine whether any others may have been exposed," the statement said.  The virus' spread also prompted South Korea and the United States to scale back joint military drills, according to three US officials  The three officials said this would be the first major impact of coronavirus on US military readiness, according to the officials. Without the full exercise, the US could lose ground in being able to quickly conduct future operations in a coordinated and highly synchronized manner with South Korea against North Korea in the event of a crisis, one of the officials said.

Among the infected is Iran's deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi. Harirchi appeared on television sweaty and ill to warn Iranians of coronavirus Monday, only to test positive for coronavirus on Tuesday.  In a news conference on national television, Harirchi coughed and wiped sweat from his face using tissues on several occasions. He was later diagnosed with coronavirus, according to state media.  Across the Middle East, flights from Iran have been halted and borders with the country have been closed as the region tries to keep the spread of a deadly coronavirus at bay. Several countries have also issued travel bans for the country.  The heavy economic sanctions imposed against Iran by the US and other bodies have made tackling the disease harder, with the country struggling to access novel coronavirus test kits, a board member of Iran's Association of Medical Equipment Importers told the semi-official news agency ILNA on Sunday.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tried to allay fears that the central government has no control over the affected regions after he was forced to admit that a hospital in the northern town of Codogno had mishandled the region's first coronavirus case and had contributed to the deadly virus' spread.  The cases are heavily concentrated in the region of Lombardy where 212 infections have been confirmed. Around 100,000 people in Lombardy and nearby Veneto are facing travel and other restrictions.  Conte on Monday night said that the hospital that treated the first coronavirus case in Codogno, known as Patient 1, had not followed protocol. Conte did not elaborate on what protocols were breached.  It was clear "there has been a management of the hospital not entirely proper according to prudent protocols, which are recommended in these cases, and this has certainly contributed to the spread," he said.  Italian authorities have identified Patient 1 as a 38-year-old man, giving only the name Mattia.  Mattia was originally in intensive care for respiratory problems at a hospital in Codogno, but is now being treated at the Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia, about 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) south of Milan, Italian Civil Protection Agency spokesman Juri Pittaluga told CNN. Mattia's pregnant wife, Valentina, has also tested positive for the virus and is in the Sacco hospital in Milan, but her health condition is "not worrying at all," Pittaluga said.  Authorities in Italy have not yet identified Patient 0, the individual who suspected of bringing the coronavirus into the country.

MUST WATCH Republican senator grills Trump's acting DHS head on coronavirus 04:52  Blame goes around in the United States  Government officials in the United States spent much of Tuesday assessing the situation, with several leveling accusations against their domestic and international counterparts.  US President Donald Trump has privately expressed frustration in recent days about some of the ways his administration is confronting a spreading coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the conversations. Publicly, he has expressed optimism that the virus is "going to go away."  Lawmakers in Congress, meanwhile, have voiced concerns that more needs to be done. Republicans and Democrats alike have suggested that the Trump administration's response has exposed vulnerabilities.  "Looking ahead, we should be passing laws to make sure we have that manufacturing capability, that we have sufficient stockpiles. You know things expire. We need to be far more strategic about how we approach these things for the next potential pandemic," Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said. "These are serious issues."  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quick to criticize China and Iran, accusing both countries of a lack of transparency. He also alleged that attempts by both governments to stifle dissent has played a part in the virus' spread.  "Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge," Pompeo said.
2020-02-25	Washington (CNN) There is mounting concern on Capitol Hill that more needs to be done to contain the coronavirus, the contagious respiratory disease that started in China and has reached from Iran to the US, with Republicans and Democrats outwardly expressing alarm and outrage.  In a tense exchange Tuesday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana pressed acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf over the issue during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing.  "You're supposed to keep us safe. The American people deserve some straight answers on the coronavirus and I'm not getting them from you," Kennedy said, after asking Wolf a series of pointed questions about transmission of the disease and the current level of preparation to deal with its spread.  "I disagree," Wolf responded, and he also directed some of Kennedy's questions to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the hearing, Wolf spoke with reporters and defended his department's readiness to defend against the disease, saying, "The department is extremely focused on protecting the American people from the coronavirus. And so we're doing that. We're implementing a number of operational measures at airports, seaports and land ports of entry. And we'll continue to do that."  Read More
2020-02-25	(CNN) — The European Union on Tuesday introduced temporary restrictions on nonessential travel to and from the EU, as part of its efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Monday.  This follows the United States' decision to suspend travel into the US from 28 European countries.  With the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic last week, countries around the world have been revising their entry policies.  Below are the restrictions in place at some key destinations. We'll be updating this story as the situation develops.  The European Union  Following a meeting Tuesday, members of the European Council along with the ECB President, the President of the Eurogroup and the High Representative agreed to reinforce the EU's external borders by restricting nonessential travel to the EU for 30 days.  There will be some exemptions, including family members of European nationals, essential staff such as doctors and nurses, and people transporting goods to the European Union. Citizens who need to get to their home countries will also be exempt from the closed borders.  United States  On Saturday, US Vice President Mike Pence announced that travel from the UK and Ireland will be suspended starting Monday night.  This is in addition to the previous US ban applying to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  Trump said last week that there would be "exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings."  Later, guidance issued from the Department of Homeland Security clarified the ban did not apply to American citizens or their family members.  The US already has other restrictions in place.  Passengers who've been in China and Iran in the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter.  US citizens who've been in China in the past 14 days can enter the US, but will be directed via one 11 airports where they'll undergo health screening. The airports include Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York (JFK or EWR), San Francisco, Seattle and Washington.  President Trump confirmed on Twitter on March 18 that Canada and the United States will close their border to non-essential traffic.  In the US state of Hawaii, Governor David Ige asked at a news conference on March 17 that travelers reconsider their vacation plans. He said:  "I am strongly encouraging our guests to postpone their vacations for at least the next 30 days and reschedule it for a later date."  Residents of California, the nation's most populous state, have been ordered to stay home.  The US State Department issued a worldwide Level 4: Do Not Travel Advisory on March 19.  A ban on non-essential travel across the US-Mexico border will be announced March 20, said Chad Wolf, Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary, on March 19.  Argentina  Argentina is in lockdown. Residents are allowed to leave for basic needs such grocery shopping or doctor's appointments but police will be patrolling the streets and those without a valid reason to be outside will be penalized.  Australia  From 9 p.m. on March 20, Australia will no longer allow entry to non-Australian citizens or residents, unless they are direct family members of Australians, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Wednesday.  He added that people with travel plans to Australia should use these next 24 hours to make alternative arrangements.  Australians overseas can still return to the country, but will be subject to a 14-day isolation upon arrival.  On March 18, Morrison declared a "human biosecurity emergency" and announced new restrictions, including an upgraded travel advice to Level 4 -- meaning "do not travel."  He added that this travel restriction is because the biggest risk comes from imported cases -- "Australians returning from overseas."  Austria  Austria has introduced border checks and placed a ban on all arrivals from Italy, China's Hubei Province, Iran and South Korea, with the exception of those with a medical certificate no more than four days old that confirms they are not affected by coronavirus.  However, travel through Austria is possible, as long as no stops are made in the country.  Bolivia  International and national flights into Bolivia will be suspended starting March 20.

He is currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit initiative funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and part of the global non-profit Vital Strategies. Resolve to Save Lives works with countries to prevent 100 million deaths and to make the world safer from epidemics. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) Covid-19 will become a pandemic. We don't yet know how severe it will be, nor do we know if the virus will spread to all continents, but it's already spreading widely in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran and elsewhere -- and thousands of undetected and infectious patients have been and continue to travel around the world.  This is unprecedented. Other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread. The last moderately severe influenza pandemics were in 1957 and 1968; each killed more than a million people around the world. Although we are far more prepared than in the past, we are also far more interconnected, and many more people today have chronic health problems that make viral infections particularly dangerous.  Based on extensive planning for an influenza pandemic by many national and international experts, we must do eight things -- some immediately and some in the coming months -- as we shift from the initiation phase of the pandemic to the acceleration stage  Find out more about how Covid-19 spreads, how deadly it is and what we can do to reduce its harms. As many as half of people with infection have no symptoms, and at least 80% of those who do feel ill have only mild symptoms. In Wuhan, China, the reported proportion of diagnosed patients who die is now 3%. That's a substantial over-estimate; many patients weren't tested, many infected people don't have symptoms and hospitals were overwhelmed. The proportion could be as low as less than 1 in 1,000 -- 30 times lower -- and is unlikely to be more than 1 in 100. The actual rate makes a huge difference, not only to patients but also to decisions about interventions. Reduce the number of people who get infected. If it turns out that many of those infected become severely ill, this would justify drastic measures such as closing or curtailing hours of schools, limiting public gatherings and reducing social contact. The lower the risk of death from infection, the less sense it makes to take these and other actions that disrupt social and economic stability. In any case, spread can be minimized by quickly isolating those who are ill, cleaning potentially contaminated surfaces often and changing common routines. We need to get serious about little things that make a big difference: washing hands, covering coughs and, if we're sick, staying home or wearing a mask when we go out. Let's stop shaking hands for a while. I prefer the traditional Southeast Asian hands-together namaste greeting, although the elbow bump is fun. Protect health care workers. Even before Covid-19, far too many health workers and patients got infections in health care facilities. We need fast and drastic improvements in triage, treatment, cleaning and overall infection prevention. A shortage of medical masks is likely; we need to ensure health care workers have enough, as should household members caring for sick relatives and people who are ill and need to go outside. For health care workers, newer, longer-lasting technologies such as elastomeric and positive air pressure respirators could address an otherwise inevitable shortage of medical masks. Improve medical care and prevention of Covid-19. A vaccine is at least a year away, and success is uncertain. Treatments that hold promise need to be evaluated rigorously. In a moderately severe pandemic, there wouldn't be enough ventilators to support patients' breathing. Health facilities and health departments in the United States can prepare for a worst-case scenario by preparing -- with training, equipment, and detailed operational plans -- for a surge in the number of patients who seek care and for the subset of those who need to be mechanically ventilated, including through ventilators available from the Strategic National Stockpile. Protect health services. During the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, more people died because of disruptions of day-to-day health care than died from Ebola. Telemedicine needs to become much more accessible, and people with chronic conditions should receive three months of medications whenever possible, in case there are supply disruptions. Routine vaccinations and other preventive services need to be preserved. Support social needs. Patients and their families will need support, especially those who are isolated and less familiar with virtual or delivery services. Continuing to support individuals and groups ranging from community centers to nursing homes will require detailed plans. Protect economic stability. Continuing to plan, teach, learn and work will reduce disruption. Businesses need to be ready to maximize telecommuting, increase cross-training and operate with as many as 40% of their staff ill or quarantined. Mission-critical enterprises need practical plans to continue to operate. Invest in public health. It will cost about $1 a person per year for at least a decade to build the health protection systems needed in Africa and Asia. That's a lot of money -- about $25 billion -- but a tiny fraction of what a preventable epidemic such as this one can cost. (SARS cost $40 billion; estimates for the potential cost of Covid-19 exceed $1 trillion.)  The virus and appropriate interventions will behave differently in high-resource than in low-resource areas, depending on crowding, capacity for diagnosis and treatment, and ability to reduce spread. We don't yet know if Covid-19 will result in thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of deaths.  Read More

The death toll from the coronavirus is now more than 2,700 worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China. There have been more than 80,000 global cases. World Health Organization officials said it's still too early to declare the novel coronavirus a pandemic — but now is the time to prepare.  The extent of the damage to several industries is becoming clearer. Virgin Australia, Danone and Diageo on Wednesday added their names to a growing list of companies that have warned about the impact that measures to contain the virus will have on their bottom lines.  Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah said the company is experiencing weak demand, an increase in cancellations and a reduction in bookings because of the outbreak.

2020-02-25	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday predicted the coronavirus is "going to go away" despite warnings from Democrats that his White House is asleep amid cresting fears in Washington that the outbreak could spark a pandemic.  The President maintained his sunny optimism about the virus that is showing signs of spreading around the world from its Chinese epicenter and is already having a huge impact on global commerce.  "I think that's a problem that's going to go away," Trump said during a trip to India, expressing confidence that the epidemic will not seriously harm the global economy.  But behind the scenes the President is less calm , and he is expressing frustration at some of the ways his administration is responding to the outbreak, sources familiar with the conversations told CNN. His mood reflects a growing realization among Trump's staff that the coronavirus is going to pose a greater challenge than previously understood.  After weeks of telling Americans that China has a lid on the situation, the President will return from India amid growing concern in Washington over the virus and partisan criticism of his attitude.  A panicked 1,000-point Wall Street sell-off, a building world supply-chain crunch and a looming hit to global growth together could pose peril for Trump by slowing the strong economy he plans to ride to reelection.  But even more worryingly, the virus is spreading to Europe and the Middle East in a way that has experts warning it could soon become a full-blown pandemic. In such a scenario, the US could not expect to escape from a wave of infections and Trump would face a test of his leadership and capacity to bring a jumpy nation together.  Trump acknowledged Monday's Wall Street plunge, but noted futures were higher ahead of Tuesday's market open in the United States and he said that his administration was putting "a lot of talent, brainpower" behind tackling the virus.  The President ticked though administration efforts to contain the virus, claiming the US had "essentially closed the borders."  "We're watching very carefully," Trump said. "We're fortunate so far and we think it's going to remain that way."  But Democrats are now sounding the alarm, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer charging Monday that the President is "asleep at the wheel" as the threat builds.  A serious outbreak in the US could put a health system already facing a tough flu season under severe pressure, posing an organizational challenge for an administration that habitually stokes chaos and sends mixed messages.  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it's too soon to tell whether the problem will go away, as the President suggested.  "We're going to be, again, preparing as if this is going to continue, preparing as if we're going to see community spread in the near-term. But I'm always going to be hopeful that disease will decline either for the summer, or that we'll be over-prepared and that we won't see this kind of high levels of transmission here in the US," she said.  Trump could face a leadership test  Even if worst-case scenarios don't come to pass, Trump's so far blasé approach to the virus, assuring Americans that Chinese President Xi Jinping is on top of the epidemic, does not seem sustainable for much longer. The President has also confidently predicted that warming spring weather could snuff out coronavirus , despite no evidence that is the case.  Yet as disquiet mounted by the hour in Washington, Trump was still not showing much concern late Monday about a virus that has infected more than 80,000 people and killed at least 2,704 worldwide and has now popped up in South Korea, Iran, Italy, Afghanistan, Kuwait and elsewhere.  During a visit to India, the President sent a tweet suggesting all was well, and predicted the stock market would bounce back.  "The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!" Trump tweeted.  The President was technically correct. Coronavirus cases here have been linked to Americans returning home from China or Japan, and have yet to spread outside contained areas. But his tone jarred with an increasingly ominous mood back home.  In a sign of increasing urgency, the administration gave senators a classified briefing on Tuesday morning about coronavirus contingency plans. Officials from the CDC, Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Institutes of Health and the State Department took part.  Lawmakers leaving the briefing Tuesday said that officials told them that a vaccine is at least one year to 18 months away.  "The vaccine for the Coronavirus is moving more rapidly than any vaccine we have already tried to approve -- but it will take a year or 18 months," said retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. "The way to stop (an outbreak) is quarantine and monitoring."  He added, "I believe it's under control. Do I think it will spread in the United States? The advice we got today is inevitably it will spread."  The White House, meanwhile, asked Congress for $1.25 billion in emergency funding to combat the outbreak.  "The Administration believes additional Federal resources are necessary to take steps to prepare for a potential worsening of the situation in the United States," it said in a letter sent to Capitol Hill.  In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the emergency funding request as "long overdue and completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency." She hinted that her chamber would provide more resources than Trump requested.  "The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis," Pelosi said.  Schumer had slammed Trump earlier Monday, saying the President was not taking the situation sufficiently seriously.  "All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic and the administration has no plan," the New York Democrat warned.  "The Trump administration has been asleep at the wheel. President Trump, good morning, there is a pandemic of coronavirus. Where are you?"  After the administration's funding request was unveiled, Schumer criticized it as "too little, too late."  Privately, Trump has lashed out against decisions made by his team and insisted stricter controls be put in place to prevent those with coronavirus -- even Americans -- from entering the United States, the sources told CNN  As The Washington Post first reported , Trump was upset to learn that 14 Americans who tested positive for coronavirus were allowed to fly back to the United States after spending weeks in quarantine on a cruise ship in Japan. He was initially told they would remain in Asia for further quarantine and was frustrated he wasn't kept abreast of the decision-making to allow them to return to the US.  He complained to multiple White House officials last week that he hadn't been consulted on the decision. But by Tuesday he seemed to agree it was ultimately the right call.  But Chelsea Clinton, who teaches at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, said the President was ignorant about global health and presided over an administration that had sought to cut funding in the area.  "The Trump administration is chronically inept at, and seemingly uninterested in, any type of long-term planning," Clinton wrote in an opinion piece on CNN.com  But White House counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted in an interview with Fox News that Trump had taken "very robust action" working with local and state officials for weeks.  "The President has been so fully engaged on the issue from the beginning," she said, citing daily calls, policy meetings and restrictions on travelers entering the US from China.  Growing concern on Capitol Hill  Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, meanwhile, said he was certain the administration could cope if the situation worsens.  "Staring all of us in the face is the specter of a possible pandemic and something we haven't witnessed in my lifetime," Shelby told reporters on Monday.  But the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said of Trump's team: "We have to depend on them. I depend on them. Give them a chance."  The sudden upsurge in political heat over the coronavirus in Washington came after Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, said that while the virus was not yet a pandemic, it was time to prepare for it to evolve in such a way.  "Look what's happened in China: We've seen a significant drop in cases, huge pressure placed on the virus and a sequential decrease in the number of cases; that goes against the logic of pandemic. Yet we see in contrast of that, an acceleration of cases in places like Korea, and therefore we are still in the balance," he said.  Economic fears mount  The global stocks sell-off on Monday came amid fears among investors that far from waning, the coronavirus outbreak was escalating in a way that could cause genuine economic damage.  The Dow closed 1,032 points, or 3.6%, lower, registering its worst day in two years.  The slump on Wall Street knocked out all the gains made by stocks so far this year, raising the possibility that the losses could extend beyond a one-day panic.  "This is how corrections start," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, told CNN International's Zain Asher.  "I think what is really happening, this is a market that fell into a bit of complacency about the fact that this coronavirus was largely contained in China and China was doing a lot about it," Hogan said.  The losses in the US followed steep dives in Asia and Europe on Monday as investors take in the risks to corporate profits and economic growth posed by the coronavirus' spread.  The warning signs have been building for days, and may just have reached a critical mass on Monday.  Apple, for instance, said last week that the outbreak was hurting its business more than it had previously expected and was hampering its manufacturing and sales in China.  Manufacturers in technology, transport and other sectors in the United States and across the world are reliant on supply chains fanning out from China, and a lengthy disruption could pose problems for sustained economic growth.  Since China represents such a large slice of the global economy, any slowdown sparked by efforts to contain the virus could have long-term effects everywhere, even if health experts manage to hold off a pandemic.  Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, warned: "The coronavirus might be slowing in mainland China, but the huge jump over the weekend to various other countries has many reassessing 2020 growth estimates."  "The International Monetary Fund already lowered China's growth this year, but should the virus continue to spread to other parts of the world, we could see quickly decreasing earnings and growth outlooks," Detrick said in a statement.  Any sign that the US economy is being affected would surely catch Trump's eye and might jolt him into more urgent action.  The President gets higher marks from voters for his economic management than for any other aspect of his presidency. He incessantly cheers stock markets as they hit new highs. But a growth slowdown and the psychological impact of a prolonged correction could complicate his pitch for a second term.  This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.
2020-02-25	(CNN) — With new cases of novel coronavirus reported daily in countries across the globe, many travelers are wondering if they should cancel or postpone existing plans and hold off on booking trips.  "Should I cancel my trip to Rome and Florence?" one CNN reader is wondering. "What is the threshold for rethinking domestic travel plans?," another asks.  Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.  It's very much an individual calculation, experts say, taking a number of factors -- the traveler, their companions, the destination and more -- into consideration.  In a situation that's unpredictable and evolving quickly, solid information is key.  "Find a very small number of sources of information that you trust, and you trust them both because they're competent and because you think they're working on your behalf," advises Baruch Fischhoff, a psychologist and professor in the department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University.  Related content Coronavirus fears spread across the world  Regularly updated advisories  Monitor those "closely and regularly," advises Dr. Henry Wu, director of Emory Healthcare's TravelWell Center  At this point, travel to China and South Korea is highly discouraged, and precautions should be taken for travel to destinations such as Italy, Japan, Iran and Hong Kong.  "In the absence of specific advisories, travelers should still consider that situations can change rapidly," said Wu, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine's Division of Infectious Diseases.  Researching your destination and paying close attention to restrictions or other public policies around coronavirus adopted by those countries will also help inform decision-making.  "In general, travelers should always assess the importance of a trip, as well as their personal risk tolerance for health dangers and hassle," Wu said.  Related content Is it safe for travelers to visit Italy?  Personal risk assessment  That's exactly what Fischhoff, who is a decision scientist by profession, is doing about a trip he has scheduled to the United Kingdom in March.  Since where the virus will turn up is quite unpredictable, he has accepted that every place comes with some degree of risk.  But if the risk were no larger than it is now, he said, the probability of dying is "very, very low" and the probability of getting sick is "vanishingly small."  The probability of being seriously inconvenienced -- stranded by a closed border or quarantined in a hotel or ship -- is "considerably higher," Fischhoff said. "Right now it's still pretty low in absolute terms, and it's not clear how quickly it's moving."  Fischhoff will continue to assess the situation as his trip approaches, he said, but he is willing to walk away from sunk costs if he decides not to go.  He encourages the same framing for other travelers: Would you be better off going or not going, regardless of the cost?  Related content Big European companies ban business travel as coronavirus outbreak escalates  Factors at play  Elderly travelers or those who have other conditions should consider that they might be at higher risk for complications of infections, Wu said.  For Angel Wilson, her mother's age is a factor in the travel decision she's wrestling with right now. Wilson in leaning toward canceling a trip to Japan in March with her daughter and mother.  "It really doesn't make sense to go now when we can always postpone it and go later when we know everything is safe," said Wilson, who is an Indianapolis-based travel adviser at Dream Journeys.  A traveler's responsibilities at home are also a potential factor in their decision-making, Fischhoff said. Those caring for young kids or elderly parents might have a lower tolerance for unexpected delays in returning home.  And some people worry more than others. If you anticipate the situation may drain the pleasure out of a leisure trip, it might be worth changing your plans, he said.  Protecting your trip  Wilson has also considered the possibility of getting stranded in Japan if the situation there worsens and travel grinds to a halt. Japan had more than 900 cases of coronavirus as of February 27, with eight deaths reported.  American Airlines has agreed to waive the fee for returning the loyalty miles Wilson used for their airline tickets to her account.  Some of her clients haven't been so lucky. While Wilson specializes in the Caribbean, Hawaii, cruising and all-inclusive vacations, a couple of her bookings have been impacted by the outbreak.  A March 1 sailing on Sapphire Princess in Asia was canceled, and while their cruise costs will be refunded, her clients are out their non-refundable airline tickets and hotel.  At this point, Wilson encourages travelers to pay more for refundable airfares and hotel rooms. She is also advising clients to pack an extra two weeks' worth of medication, just in case.  She recommends purchasing Cancel for Any Reason insurance policies. It's the only type of travel insurance that applies in this scenario, she said.  The coverage tends to be about 30% more expensive than other types of travel insurance, according to Wilson.  Vendors have their own rules about how their policies work. Some offer up to about 80% cash back, while others may offer future booking credit only.  Some suppliers are starting to update their policies. AmaWaterways is now offering a Travel Waiver Plus to give clients more piece of mind when booking, Wilson said.  "They're offering this to guests who are already booked, as well as new bookings," she said.  Health precautions  Whether it's from coronavirus or influenza, travelers should always take precautions to protect themselves from infection.  "I am unaware of any documented cases of COVID-19 acquired during flights, but I would advise travelers on flights take the usual precautions to prevent respiratory illnesses, including handwashing and refraining from travel while ill," said Wu.  Flu vaccines are recommended as influenza is also spreading, and flu prevention could also prevent symptoms that will raise novel coronavirus concerns, Wu said.  Ultimately, each traveler's risk calculation will be different.

2020-02-25	HHS Secretary Alex Azar speaks about the coronavirus while flanked by (from left to right) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert Kadlec, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen Hahn during a press briefing at the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters on Tuesday, February 25, in Washington. Mark Wilson/Getty Images  While the US Food and Drug is not aware of any shortages of medical products being reported in the United States, it is monitoring some that could be at risk, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told reporters Tuesday.  "FDA is keenly aware that the outbreak will likely affect the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to suppliers [and] shortages of critical medical products in the US," Hahn said.  In particular, the FDA is keeping its eye on personal protective equipment such as face masks and gowns used by health care workers. The agency is proactively reaching out to hundreds of manufacturers of medical products for information related to these concerns, Hahn said.  More on this: US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said some of the $2.5 billion requested funds would be used to purchase personal protection equipment for the national stockpile. On Tuesday morning, Azar told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there are 30 million N95 respirators in the Strategic National Stockpile, and the US would need about 10 times that for health care workers.  Hahn also said that the agency is postponing roughly 100 scheduled inspections in China over February and March — mostly routine surveillance inspections meant to ensure that medical products produced in China meet the standards for entering the US marketplace. But he said these can happen at any time during the year, and the agency is moving things around so they can stay on schedule when it comes to planned inspections for the year.
2020-02-25	Hong Kong (CNN) Multiple outbreaks of the novel coronavirus outside of mainland China have continued to worsen, as experts warn we may be approaching pandemic levels.  A World Health Organization team landed in Italy late Monday to "support Italian authorities in understanding the situation," the WHO said. The team's focus will be on "limiting further human-to-human transmission" after a rapid rise in cases. At least 272 people have been infected with the virus, and seven people have died in the Southern European nation.  In South Korea , more than 970 cases have been confirmed, up from 31 a week ago. At least 10 people have died, and the virus has spread throughout the country, though the worst outbreak remains in the southern city of Daegu.  Chinese authorities announced the postponement of the National People's Congress (NPC), the country's rubber-stamp parliament, an unprecedented move in recent times. It comes after President Xi Jinping warned Sunday that that novel coronavirus is the worst public health crisis facing the country since its founding.  At the end of Monday, China's National Health Commission's had recorded 77,658 cases in the mainland, and 2,663 deaths. The novel coronavirus has now infected at least 80,067 people worldwide and killed at least 2,700.

South Korea in crisis  Even as the outbreak appeared to be stabilizing in parts of China, with six provinces on Monday lowering their response level, the number of cases worldwide has continued to grow.  In South Korea, all flights have been suspended to Daegu, the southern city where the initial outbreak occurred. Several countries and territories have announced restrictions on travel from South Korea, or new warnings for citizens traveling to the country.  The Daegu outbreak had been centered around the Shincheonji religious group, but the virus appears to have spread now beyond practitioners.  Several hundred members of the group have tested positive for the virus, and more than 9,000 practitioners have been put into self-isolation while they are tested by health authorities. The infection is believed to have transmitted rapidly because of the mass worship sessions the group holds, which puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time.  Shincheonji has said they are the "biggest victims" of the outbreak, and warned people against "groundless attacks" against them because of the outbreak. They have said they are cooperating with the authorities amid accusations of secret member rolls making it difficult to track potential cases through the country.  Speaking late Monday, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said military commanders in Korea "are looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus."  Esper said he is confident the US and South Korea will "remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together."  Hundreds of cases of the virus have been confirmed across the country, including among the military. Soldiers often live in close confines and there are fears of a self-sustaining outbreak among forces based in various areas.  Italian outbreak  Outside of Asia, one of the worst outbreak is in Italy, where around 100,000 people in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto are facing travel and other restrictions as the country struggles to contain a sudden spike in cases that has so far seen at least 219 confirmed cases.  Strict emergency measures were put in place over the weekend, including a ban on public events in at least 10 municipalities, after a spike in confirmed cases in both regions.  Italy still has not identified "patient zero," the source of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, two officials said Monday.  "The important thing is to identify 'patient zero,' where he/she is from, and to stop this chain of infection," Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's civil protection agency, said.  Luca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto region, said "no news" when asked Monday by CNN affiliate Sky 24 about the hunt for the carrier.  Borrelli suggested an explanation for the sudden spike in cases over the weekend: "I believe that the incubation period meant that the infections all exploded at a certain moment."  In a statement Monday , the European Commission said was providing aid worth $250 million to affected regions and sectors of the EU.  "As cases continue to rise, public health is the number one priority. Whether it be boosting preparedness in Europe, in China or elsewhere, the international community must work together. Europe is here to play a leading role," said Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission.  The Commission added that it was stepping up support for member states following developments in Italy.  Stella Kyriakides, commissioner for health and food safety said: "In view of the rapidly evolving situation, we stand ready to increase our assistance. In this vein, a joint expert mission of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization will depart to Italy this week to support the Italian authorities."  Iran struggling to contain  Across the Middle East, flights from Iran have stopped and borders with the country have been closed as the region tries to keep the spread of a deadly coronavirus at bay.  Iran is on the front line of the outbreak -- the health ministry has confirmed 61 cases and 14 deaths.  One Iranian lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani from the holy city of Qom, criticized the government's handling of the outbreak, accusing officials of covering up numbers. Farahani said 50 people had died from the virus in Qom, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Iran, though the country's health ministry has denied his claims.  The heavy economic sanctions imposed against Iran by the US and other bodies have made tackling the disease harder, with the country struggling to access novel coronavirus test kits, a board member of Iran's Association of Medical Equipment Importers told the semi-official news agency ILNA on Sunday.  Ramin Fallah told ILNA that "many international companies are ready to supply Iran with coronavirus test kits, but we can't send them money" because of the US sanctions.

Despite the rapid spread of the virus around the world in the past week, health officials are not yet calling this a pandemic -- though they're close.  William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN that "we're on the knife's edge."  There is no precise, mathematical definition of a pandemic. Outbreaks get characterized as pandemics by epidemiologists -- who are not yet using the term. They'll be looking for evidence of sustained transmission among people who have not recently traveled to China or has close contact with someone who recently traveled to China.  As more information emerges over how the virus is being spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea, among other countries, that evidence may soon arise.  Markets have plunged on fears of an imminent pandemic declaration. The Dow has lost more than 1,400 points in the last three trading days, wiping out any gains for the year so far. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also fell, and Asian markets have been suffering due to the virus and fears of a wider economic downturn.

(CNN) President Donald Trump keeps telling us not to worry, that the fast-spreading COVID-19, the coronavirus, is "going to go away," soon, probably by "April," and that a vaccine is "close." The experts, including federally-employed top scientists, say he's wrong on all these counts. (Please don't fire them!)  Why is the President lying? Take a guess. Because he thinks the virus, and fear of contagion, is bad for him. On that count, he's absolutely correct. Unfortunately, claiming that the virus is not a big problem does nothing to ease the infection rate or the economic impact that is sure to span the globe before long.  Only a small fraction of coronavirus victims -- worldwide more than 80,000 people sickened and more than 2,700 killed -- have been Americans. Almost all of the cases have been in China.  But the virus could have a dramatic impact on the future of the United States even if not one more American becomes infected. And Trump knows this.  This virus, a public health emergency and a human tragedy, is also a sudden and powerful factor affecting the global economy. As a result, it could end up playing a key role in determining the outcome of the 2020 election in the United States.  An economic shock from a large-scale epidemic or a pandemic could affect any presidency, but that is particularly true of this one for two principal reasons: First, the President's main argument for reelection is that he has done a great job on the economy. He falsely claims this is the greatest economy in US history, even though it created more jobs under President Barack Obama and grew faster many other times.  Second, Trump was elected by the thinnest of margins. He lost the popular vote and could have lost the presidency if fewer than 80,000 votes in three states had gone to his political rival.  If the 2020 election is close once again, an erosion in America's economic performance could sway enough people to deny him reelection.  Obviously, that is not the only factor. The Democrats' choice of candidate may be a much more important consideration for voters.  Still, the inescapable impact of the coronavirus on the US economy could prove pivotal.  There is no chance the virus will leave America's economy unscathed. The virus is spreading , reaching dozens of countries, with big new outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran.  But even if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That's because China has become a global economic powerhouse: The loom in the tapestry of interconnected threads that is global commerce. Those who thought the impact of COVID-19 would resemble that of another epidemic, SARS in 2003, missed the contrast.  As the virus makes its way into dozens of countries , the economic shockwaves will still flow most potently from what is happening in China. China has been the engine of growth for years, accounting for about one-third of all the growth in the world.  China is a voracious consumer of exports from around the world, and in recent years, it has also become an important consumer of finished goods.  With segments of China shut down to prevent contagion, its economy, which was already growing at the slowest rate in decades, could see growth cut in half. That means less manufacturing and less purchasing of raw materials. China has been buying most of the world's cement, coal, steel, nickel, copper and countless other commodities.  A slowdown there will be a gut-punch to exporters in multiple countries.  China sells and buys massively from every US state , from airplanes to cars, to grains. Chinese consumers buy cars, luxury goods and travel extensively. Or at least they did before the epidemic.  But it may be China's pivotal role in the supply chain of global production that has the greatest effect. China makes pieces of just about everything we buy, from electronics to medications. Apple warned it won't meet its sales goals. The Food and Drug administration is reportedly concerned about possible shortages of some 150 prescription drugs.  Airlines around the world are taking a hit. And the cruise industry is facing huge losses, according to Yahoo Finance.  Even the movie industry, which has become increasingly reliant on audiences in the world's most populous nation, will feel the pummeling from the closure of 70,000 theaters in China.  We know China's economy will experience a sharp slowdown. Japan Singapore and South Korea are next in line. European countries could get tipped into recession. Germany France and Italy were already struggling before the outbreak. In fact, the world was just starting to regain its footing from Trump's trade wars when the virus struck.  A global slowdown will inevitably strike the United States. That's the realization that produced an anxiety attack on Wall Street on Monday and Tuesday, the biggest drop in years.  It's why Trump had reportedly feared taking measures that signal panic.  Democrats in Congress are fuming. According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the President's $2.5 billion funding request to fight the virus is "long overdue and completely inadequate." She vowed that the House provide more than Trump requested, and "advance a strong, strategic funding package," commensurate with the challenge.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts -- not to the President. He's not telling the truth. He's gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts.  Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, claimed the virus would help American workers. "I don't want to talk about a victory lap," he said, but it could bring jobs to America.  But the virus will hurt America. Private economists are already slashing economic projections.  It's impossible to know the magnitude of the hit. But it's not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump's "black swan," the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection.

Harvey Weinstein  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer whose alleged abusive behavior brought the #MeToo movement into the mainstream, was found guilty of two felony sex crimes yesterday at his trial in New York. A jury convicted Weinstein of criminal sexual act and rape based on the accounts of two women. He was acquitted of the more serious charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in the first degree. The verdict is being hailed as a critical turning point for the #MeToo movement -- his accusers called it " just a drop in a wave of justice to come ." The movie mogul faces at least five years and up to more than two decades in prison and is set to be sentenced March 11. While on his way to jail, Weinstein was taken to a hospital after feeling chest pains and having heart palpitations.

Malaysia  Malaysia has descended into political chaos after the country's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned yesterday and his party exited the ruling coalition. Despite turning in his letter of resignation, though, Mahathir has managed to hang onto the job after the King appointed him interim Prime Minister, and he's likely to form a new government within a few days. Still, negotiations could continue through the week, and the country could be on track for a snap election at some point soon. The surprise announcement comes after speculation that the 94-year-old leader was trying to form a new ruling coalition that would exclude his promised successor, Anwar Ibrahim. The two have a complicated relationship that goes back decades. It's unclear who the next prime minister will be or whether general elections will be held.

Hong Kong  A Chinese court has sentenced Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai to 10 years in prison for "providing intelligence" overseas.

Gui, 55, was one of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who went missing in late 2015 , before resurfacing in Chinese police custody. The booksellers were all linked to a Hong Kong publisher best known for gossipy titles about China's ruling elite. Months after Gui went missing, he appeared on Chinese state television in 2016 confessing to an alleged drunken driving incident more than a decade earlier. Many human rights advocates believed he had been coerced into making the statement. Gui was released in 2017, only to be detained by China again a few months later.

2020-02-25	(CNN) One of the top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans on Tuesday that health experts foresee the novel coronavirus that has killed thousands spreading in the United States.  "We expect we will see community spread in this country," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."  The agency tweeted Tuesday evening that Americans should think about getting ready.  "Now is the time for US businesses, hospitals, and communities to begin preparing for the possible spread of #COVID19," it wrote, referring to the name the World Health Organization has given the novel coronavirus. "CDC continues to work with business, education & healthcare sectors, encouraging employers to be prepared."

CDC continues to work with business, education & healthcare sectors, encouraging employers to be prepared. Learn more: https://t.co/OUYvMhdIaS .  Messonnier said her agency wants people to understand their lives might be disrupted.  "We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad," she said.  She said CDC officials have been saying for weeks that while they hope the spread won't be severe in the United States, they are planning as if it could be.  "The data over the last week, and the spread in other countries, has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation" of community spread, she said.  The CDC still doesn't know what that will look like, she added. Community spread could be reasonably mild or very severe.  Americans should also talk to employers about working online and talk to doctor's offices about telehealth, the CDC says.  Messonnier said she talked her family and told them that while they are not at risk right now, they should plan for what to do if their lives were significanly impacted. She said she called the children's school district about what would happen if schools need to close.  US cases up  Also Tuesday, the agency said the number of cases in the United States has risen to 57, with four more patients who were on a cruise ship.  JUST WATCHED Religious group at heart of surge in virus cases in South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Religious group at heart of surge in virus cases in South Korea 02:37  The CDC is employing a twofold approach, working to contain the virus while also implementing strategies to lessen the impacts on communities, Messonnier told reporters.  "We've also enacted the first quarantine of this scale in the US, and are supporting the State Department and (Department of Health and Human Services) in repatriating citizens from high-risk areas," she said.  In addition, the center is tracking and isolating cases when it can, issuing travel advisories for affected countries and taking on the increasingly difficult task of preventing the introduction of new cases, most notably at points of entry into the United States, she said.  Messonnier described the containment strategies as "largely successful" and said they were geared toward "buying us more time to prepare."  40 cases from cruise ship  The current total breaks down to 40 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was traveling in Asia, three people repatriated from China, and 14 US cases.  Of the 14 US cases, two of them were the result of person-to-person transmission, one coming in California and the other in Illinois, health officials said.  The breakdown of US cases is eight in California, two in Illinois and one each in Massachusetts, Washington, Arizona and Wisconsin.

MUST WATCH Why Wall Street underestimated coronavirus concerns 01:50  The three patients repatriated from China came from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the CDC.  The two person-to-person transmissions are concerning, as is the fact the virus has caused deaths -- two of the three criteria necessary for declaring a pandemic, she said.  "As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer toward meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus," she warned. "As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder."  Late last week, CDC officials said there were more Diamond Princess passengers who tested positive for coronavirus in Japan and those cases would be added to the US count once the results were official.  Symptoms similar to a cold  News of the uptick in US cases comes as the worldwide count topped 80,000 people , the overwhelming majority in China. At least 2,700 people have died.  The emergence of hundreds of cases outside China -- namely, in Italy and South Korea -- has served to disrupt global supply chains, corporate profits and American and international markets  The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness , similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.  For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia or bronchitis.  There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.  There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. People with symptoms that feel worse than a standard cold should see their doctor.  Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough.  Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible.  People may be able to reduce their risk of infection by avoiding those who are sick, avoiding touching their eyes, nose and mouth, and washing hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds.  Correction: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Nancy Messonnier's name.
2020-02-26	(CNN) A growing list of American universities have canceled study abroad programs as the novel coronavirus continues to spread .  At least seven universities have suspended programs in Italy, where the number of confirmed cases has risen to 374, including 12 deaths. Others have canceled programs in China and South Korea.  Semester at Sea, an educational cruise program with hundreds of American students on board, was due to visit Seychelles and Mauritius, but is rerouting to Mozambique instead after learning the ship would be turned away.  Here is a list of the universities and programs impacted. We'll continue adding newer ones up top.  University of Georgia  The University of Georgia is suspending all Spring of 2020 study abroad programs in South Korea. The University sent the information in a message to UGA exchange students in South Korea late Thursday, according to a UGA spokesperson.  It followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning against non-essential travel to South Korea based on the spread of the Coronavirus.  In it's statement to students, UGA said "we are requesting all UGA study abroad students in South Korea impacted by this decision to return to the United States. We are ready to assist you and we will work with you on academic and financial concerns."  Villanova University  Citing the "rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Northern Italy," Villanova said it would be bringing home its students who are abroad there. "The University is in close contact with other study abroad programs in which Villanova students are participating and will determine appropriate responses to additional disruptions caused by the coronavirus," it said.  With spring break around the corner, Villanova recommended students and staff "be cautious about their travel choices."  Gonzaga University  Gonzaga said it was suspending all courses on the Gonzaga in Florence campus and that as of March 6 all all "pensiones and homestays" would be closed for the remainder of the semester.  University of Colorado Boulder  CU Boulder said it was suspending all study abroad programs in both China and South Korea for the current and summer semesters.  Elon University  Elon University announced that it has suspended its program in Florence, Italy, for the semester.  The North Carolina university said 21 Elon students and one faculty member will return home from Italy this week and its Italian academic partners will ensure the students are able to complete all coursework remotely.  "This was a difficult decision for the university to make, given that these students were already immersed in these important global experiences," Elon University's global education dean Woody Pelton said in a news release . "However, the health and safety of students is our top priority."  "Given the uncertainty about the spread of the virus and its anticipated impact on travel and our academic program in Florence, we decided it was best to bring these students home as soon as possible," Dean Pelton said.  Fairfield University  Fairfield University announced yesterday that it has immediately closed its Florence University of the Arts study abroad program and required all students enrolled in the program to depart Italy.  "The University is working through the logistics of allowing these students to return to Fairfield University's campus on March 15, after our spring break, and resume classes on campus," the Connecticut school said in a news release. "Students will have the option of both online and hybrid courses to ensure they remain on track toward their graduation dates."  The university said 142 students are enrolled in the program.  Florida International University  Florida International University announced Tuesday that study abroad programs to Italy, Singapore, Japan and South Korea have been canceled.  The university said any students or employees who are currently on university business in those countries must return to the US immediately.  New York University  New York University announced earlier this week that it has canceled classes for the rest of the week at NYU Florence.  The university said it suspended operations at the campus on Thursday, February 27, and it will begin holding classes remotely starting on March 2.  The university has urged students to leave Florence during this period.  Syracuse University  And Syracuse University announced that it has suspended its program in Florence and is working to assist its students with returning to the US.  "We are working directly with our students to arrange their return to the United States. We will do everything we can to minimize disruption to their academic studies and their lives," the university said in a news release . "Many will choose to return to main campus. However, they will not return until after spring break."  The New York university said at least 342 students are studying abroad in Italy.  One of them, Syracuse junior Josh Kurzer, told CNN he was "shocked" when he found out that his program had been canceled. "As of this morning, I was starting to get worried and I booked a flight home," Kurzer, 20, said by phone from Italy. "It's been rock bottom, all I can do is laugh right now" the student said.  He says everyone had heard the virus was spreading in Italy but "people weren't worried."  "We thought classes would be canceled for a week and that's it."  University of Tennessee  The University of Tennessee's Center for Global Engagement (CGE) is suspending all spring and summer education abroad programs in both China and South Korea, it announced on February 18  "We can assist you in communication to reassure your collaborators that there is no stigma that we associate with them or their organizations, but we must do our part in containing the virus," it told faculty, staff and students affected by the restrictions.  The university also said it would keep current study abroad students, as well as students who applied for upcoming study abroad programs, updated.  Semester at Sea  The study abroad program Semester at Sea, based on a cruise ship that's been retrofitted into a floating campus, is rerouting with hundreds of American students on board.  After visiting Japan and Vietnam earlier this semester, the ship was due to port in Seychelles but was told it would be blocked by local officials.  "We have just learned that the Seychelles Ministry of Health and the Seychelles Port Authority has denied the MV World Odyssey entry to the Seychelles," the program announced on its website . "Despite multiple appeals and no evidence of health concerns on the ship, the decision was upheld."  Believing the ship would be denied entry to Mauritius as well, administrators decided to reroute the voyage to Mozambique. Students will be given credit for missed assignments and the chance to make them up there.  This is a breaking story and will continue to be updated.

2020-02-26	London (CNN Business) Food and drink giants Danone ( DANOY ) and Diageo ( DEO ) are the latest companies to warn that the coronavirus outbreak will cost them millions of dollars in sales and hurt profits.  They join a growing list of businesses, from airlines, car manufacturers and smartphone makers to shipping companies and tourism firms, to disclose financial damage linked to the coronavirus, which has disrupted China, a major producer and consumer of their goods and services, and spread to other big economies.  Investors are now panicking over the impact of the virus, with global stock markets entering their fifth consecutive day of losses on Wednesday.  , the maker of Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Guinness and Captain Morgan, warned Wednesday that sales could be hit by as much as £325 million ($421 million) in the 2020 fiscal year. Earnings could be dented by up to £200 million ($259 million).  The closure of bars and restaurants in China, as well as a "substantial reduction in banqueting" has caused "significant disruption" since the end of January, the UK drinks maker said in a statement. Consumption has also dropped in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, it added.  Diageo said that current forecasts exclude any impact of the coronavirus on markets outside of Asia Pacific, which accounts for 20% of its sales.  The company makes a quarter of its sales in Europe, where authorities are scrambling to contain a coronavirus outbreak in Italy that has infected over 320 people and resulted in 12 deaths. France reported its first coronavirus death Wednesday.  Danone's water business hit  Danone DANOY , which makes Evian bottled water and Alpro yoghurt, said it expects the coronavirus to shave €100 million ($109 million) off sales in the first quarter, mostly in its bottled water business in China. Sales growth in the quarter is now expected to be "broadly flat," it added.  The French company also said that sales and profits for the full year could be hit.  China is Danone's second biggest market and it accounted for 10% of sales last year. The company employs 8,200 people in the country, where it has eight factories, including one in Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak.  That factory, which makes bottled water, remains closed and the shutdown has affected distribution across the supply chain, Danone said in an earnings presentation.  It added that the impact of the virus has delayed the rebranding of its Mizone water business in China to the second quarter, which could put summer sales at risk.  "While we cannot currently predict the duration and extent of the impact of [the coronavirus], we remain extremely vigilant and are closely monitoring the situation every day, working hand in hand with the local authorities," the company said in a statement.  Coronavirus spreads  The death toll from the coronavirus is over 2,700 worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China. There have been more than 80,000 global cases.  Officials and business leaders had been hoping that dramatic action taken by China would slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent it from gaining traction around the world.  But the emergence of hundreds of coronavirus cases in Japan, Italy and South Korea has dashed hopes of a speedy recovery.  Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Wednesday that the United States needs to prepare for a potential pandemic.  "You have the makings of a pandemic," Fauci said. "If that's the case, if we have a pandemic, then we will be impacted."
2020-02-26	(CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday placed Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the US government response to the novel coronavirus , amid growing criticism of the White House's handling of the outbreak.  At a wide-ranging White House news conference, the President defended the White House's response , stressing the administration's ongoing efforts and resources devoted to combating the virus.  "Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low," Trump said.  The President did not close the door to Senate Democrats' call for more than $8 billion in emergency funding for anti-coronavirus efforts, despite Democrats' dramatic jump from the $2.5 billion in total funding proposed by the White House.  "We'll spend whatever is appropriate. Hopefully, we won't have to spend so much because we really think that we've done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum," Trump said.  The President did not announce any new travel restrictions during the news conference, saying that "right now it's not the right time" for restrictions on other countries, including South Korea and Italy, which have had a large number of coronavirus cases.  As CNN previously reported , Trump had been privately lashing out at officials for coronavirus-related decisions. His instinct has been to seal off the US from those testing positive, even Americans, though he acknowledged at a news conference in India that allowing them back into the US was the right thing to do.  He also told reporters Wednesday that the US was obliged to repatriate the infected American citizens who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship  "We could have left them and that would have been very bad," Trump said.  On Tuesday, one of the top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had warned Americans that health experts foresee the coronavirus, which has killed thousands abroad, spreading in the US.  "We expect we will see community spread in this country," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."  But Trump appeared to push back on the CDC's assessment, saying Wednesday that he does not believe that community spread in the US is inevitable.  The President told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta at the briefing that he's not worried about the spread of the virus in the US.  "No, because we're ready for it," Trump responded. "It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it."  The President said that most of the Americans who have been diagnosed with the virus in the US are doing well.  "Of the 15 people ... eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. One is in the hospital. And five have fully recovered. And one we think is in pretty good shape," Trump said, but later added, "One is pretty sick but hopefully will recover."  The President returned from India to see his administration on the defensive over its handling of the coronavirus, as Cabinet officials were grilled in Congress and Democrats panned the White House's budget request to fight the virus.  The stock market decline especially has exacerbated Trump's rising concerns over how to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus even as he has publicly declared the virus to be "very much under control in the USA," multiple people tell CNN.  But investors are growing concerned about the economic impact of the virus, as is the President, whose reelection campaign is banking on a strong economy.  The President suggested at the news conference on Wednesday that Tuesday night's Democratic debate in South Carolina was part of the cause of the stock market decline -- even though it took place after the market's dip.  "I think you can add quite a bit of sell-off to what they're saying," Trump said. "I really believe that's a factor."  Trump has been publicly downplaying the novel coronavirus' effects, because he thinks doing otherwise could cause further panic in the markets -- and he's been frustrated with officials issuing warnings about the unknowns of the virus's spread. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is one aide who encouraged Trump to downplay the latest developments, at least publicly, one person says.  Unhappy with administration's response  The appointment of Pence came after the White House denied it was considering appointing a czar to oversee the administration's response outbreak.  Trump said Pence would not be a "czar," but stressed the vice president will be coordinating the efforts.  "Mike will be working with the professionals, doctors and everybody else that is working. The team is brilliant. I spent a lot of time with the team the last couple weeks," the President said. "But they are brilliant and we're doing really well and Mike is going to be in charge and Mike will report back to me. But he has a certain talent for this."  According to administration sources, Trump has been displeased with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- for failing to keep him updated on crucial decisions concerning the virus.  Lawmakers have also called on Trump to appoint someone to oversee the response, which came up during a clash over the administration's request for more coronavirus funding. Some White House officials accused HHS of requesting disproportionate amounts of money to cover up what one official described as Azar's "mismanagement."  Standing beside Trump and Pence at the end of the news conference, Azar asserted that he's still the chairman of the coronavirus task force and added that he was "delighted" to learn the vice president would be leading the administration on the issue.  Travel restrictions under consideration  Earlier this month, the US began implementing travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had visited China and US citizens who have been near the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China's Hubei province. Before Trump announced the China restrictions, there was a debate inside the White House about the logistics of applying such a ban.  And behind the scenes, Trump is pushing for more travel restrictions on countries the virus is spreading to, administration officials tell CNN, but so far no decisions have been made.  Administration officials have been privately weighing imposing additional travel bans, a senior administration official and sources close to the White House said.  The administration increased the travel advisory warning for Japan and South Korea earlier this week, so those two countries would be likely targets for increased travel restrictions.  There have been more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus globally and the death toll has risen to more than 2,700, the majority in mainland China.  The US has 60 confirmed cases, US health officials said Tuesday, a number that is expected to grow.  Despite the spread of the virus, World Health Organization officials are not yet calling this a pandemic , though they're close.  In January, the WHO declared the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern."  This story has been updated with additional comments from President Trump's news conference on the novel coronavirus.
2020-02-26	There are “ongoing” conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for the novel coronavirus given the rapid spread of the infection in Italy, South Korea and Japan, according to an agency spokesperson.  Currently, the United States is doing health screenings only for passengers who are flying in from China.  At the time that the CDC made the decision to start those screenings, there were far fewer cases of the coronavirus in China as there are currently in Japan, Italy or South Korea.  When the screening started on January 17, there were 45 cases of the new coronavirus in China. Japan currently has about three times that number of cases, Italy has about 10 times as many and South Korea has more than 25 times as many.
2020-02-26	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's optimistic statements about the coronavirus are increasingly being undermined by more alarming comments from public health officials in his own administration and warnings the outbreak is now certain to reach US soil.  While Trump is reassuring the nation that the virus is "going to go away" and is "very well under control," stock markets that he uses as a barometer of his administration's success tank, and health experts are painting a far more dire picture, even suggesting that a pandemic is getting closer.  A top US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination expert warned Tuesday that the virus could bring severe disruption to American life, affecting schools and businesses, and told people to get ready now.  The disconnect between Dr. Nancy Messonnier's comments and Trump's stance raised doubts about the coherence of the administration's response and the question of how the President will respond, given his history of turning on officials who contradict his views with evidence-based reasoning.  CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak reported Wednesday that the President has been publicly downplaying the possible effects of the virus on the United States to avoid provoking further panic in the markets but that he has been frustrated with officials warning about the unknowns of the virus's possible spread.  Another official, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN's "New Day" Wednesday that Messonnier was reflecting the spread of coronavirus through countries like Italy, Iran and South Korea.  "When that happens, then you have the makings of a pandemic," Fauci said. "What she was saying was that being the case, if we have a pandemic, almost certainly we are going to get impacted."  Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, meanwhile told ABC News that the way that the epidemic was spreading could soon challenge US efforts to contain it.  "We recognize that our very strong measures here in the United States to contain the virus, to keep it limited to very low numbers, may not hold for the long haul," Schuchat said.  Trump tweeted shortly after returning home from India on Wednesday that he had a meeting on the virus planned later in the day and that his staff were all doing a "great job." He announced Wednesday morning that he will hold a news conference at the White House about coronavirus at 6 p.m. ET.  Nervousness on Capitol Hill was exacerbated by a string of developments that appeared to reflect Messonnier's assessment of the situation better than the President's rosier commentary. The CDC said Tuesday night that coronavirus was not recognized to be spreading inside the United States. It said if sustained transmission did occur, its strategy would call on those infected to stay home from work. School dismissals and the cancellation of mass meetings might be necessary as well as telecommuting for office workers.  The mayor of San Francisco declared a state of emergenc y to prepare for the possible arrival of the virus. Questions about the government's capacity to monitor widespread outbreaks deepened when it emerged that only 12 state and local health laboratories can test for Covid-19. Another stocks sell-off provoked by concern about the disease's quickening wiped another 900 points fr om the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Trump's assurance that a vaccine is close appeared to be born from the same sense of hope that led him to predict that warming temperatures in the spring will snuff out the virus.  To date, there are 57 recorded cases of coronavirus in the United States, including 40 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, three people who were brought home from China and 14 other patients. Meanwhile, the virus is grabbing a stronger foothold in Europe and Asia.  So far, Trump's political interests appear to have led the President to seek to minimize the threat from the virus and the chances of it evolving into an epidemic on American soil.  But fast-moving developments mean that Trump looks behind the curve of the growing threat to the United States -- a dangerous position for a President who is seeking a second term. Democrats, apparently looking for vulnerabilities, are warning that his administration is asleep as a possible pandemic builds.  In the next few days, the President's political interests may dictate a far more proactive attitude, given that a crisis that rages out of control could taint his White House with a reputation for incompetence.  Behind the scenes, the President is frustrated  Privately, the President may have come to that conclusion already. CNN reported Tuesday that Trump was becoming frustrated with his administration's response to the situation and that officials were beginning to acknowledge that the epidemic was going to become a greater problem than first thought.  Given the torrent of foreboding news, as coronavirus emerged as a greater threat in Europe and the global death toll reached 2,763, Trump's upbeat assessment delivered in New Delhi appeared to have aged badly.  The President said the coronavirus situation was "very well under control in our country." And he added "that whole situation will start working out." Trump also hit at Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who blasted the White House's emergency $1.25 billion funding request as "too little, too late."  On Air Force One, Trump tweeted that "if I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn't like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!"  Other White House officials tried to play down a building sense of dread -- an important role in a time of crisis -- as long as such confidence reflects reality.  Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC that the virus was "very contained" in the United States and that health experts were prepared for all eventualities. The administration says it has got its best brains working on the virus and said Trump has taken part in multiple meetings and briefings on the situation.  "I would echo the words of the WHO that said don't overreact. My own view is don't panic. I'm an old guy, been around a long time, I've seen these things come and go," Kudlow said.  Schumer said that he hoped that the administration's optimistic forecasts about the coronavirus situation were not intended to juice stocks but added: "When Larry Kudlow says it's contained you get to wonder what the motivation is."  The message coming from appointees in the government's health infrastructure is far less reassuring than that voiced by Trump's political subordinates in the West Wing.  "The data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,"the CDC's Messonnier told reporters on a conference call.  Messonnier said it was not known when coronavirus would take root in the US and how dangerous it might be. But she warned: "Disruption to everyday life might be severe," adding that schools and families should begin to prepare now.  "It's not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather, more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."  Concern on both sides of the aisle  Concern about coronavirus is becoming one of the rare issues that crosses party lines in polarized Washington.  Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana confronted the acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf about the virus in the Senate Appropriations sub-committee.  "You're supposed to keep us safe. The American people deserve some straight answers on the coronavirus and I'm not getting them from you," Kennedy said, after asking about transmission of the disease and levels of preparedness.  Wolf told reporters after the hearing that his department was "extremely focused."  "We're implementing a number of operational measures at airports, seaports and land ports of entry," he said.  Senators attended a classified briefing on Tuesday morning with DHS, HHS and CDC officials about the progress of a vaccine, supply chain issues and the possibility of a spike in cases of coronavirus within US borders.  But senators in both parties cast doubt on the readiness of the administration.  "It's completely inadequate to the threat that exists. A real, present danger of outbreaks in the United States," Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said.  This story has been updated to include additional reporting and reaction.
2020-02-26	(CNN) Illness was never accepted as a valid reason to miss services at the Shincheonji religious group, says former member Duhyen Kim.  This is an organization that took roll call, he says, and everyone had to physically swipe in and out of services with a special card. Any absence was noted and followed up on.  "The culture was, even though you're sick you come in on Sunday. If you're so sick you can't come Sunday, you have to come on Monday or Tuesday -- you have to make up for the time," Kim says. He describes how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services "packed together like sardines."  The religious group -- an offshoot of Christianity -- is now at the heart of South Korea's novel coronavirus outbreak, particularly in the city of Daegu.  South Korean authorities believe a large number of cases in the country attended a Shincheonji service or have been in contact with attendees.  The religious group says it is cooperating with local authorities, and has shut down all church services and gatherings.  A disinfection professional wears protective gear and sprays anti-septic solution at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, on on February 24.  "We are sanitizing every church and annex buildings all across the nation, including Daegu branch. We will actively participate in disease prevention activity, following the government's measure," reads a statement from the group.  The religious group also lashed out at its critics.  "The media had been reporting that we are the main culprit in the spread of virus, referring to our 'unusual service style' -- a reality where we had to hold service on the floor to maximize the number of occupants in our small space," the statement adds.  But Kim, who still has friends within the group, and other former members have told CNN that attendees are not allowed to wear anything on their faces -- even glasses -- during prayer time.  "They were forced recently not to wear masks even though the whole corona (virus) outbreak was going on. They said, no, it's disrespectful to God to have masks on," Kim says.  Shincheonji has not returned CNN's calls for comment.  A new support network  Kim says he joined in 2006 as a 19-year-old student who had just arrived in South Korea to study.  The South African didn't have a support network and says he was quickly "recruited."  At first, he says his friends did not reveal they were part of Shincheonji. But after 18 months, they introduced him to a Bible study group, and slowly brought him into their religious world.  "At that time, I was an expat," he says. "These people became my community, my friends I could rely on, (people) I could go out for dinner, drinks (with)."  Kim's native English-language skills helped him rise in the organization. By 2011, he says he was the international affairs director and personal interpreter of founder and leader Lee Man-hee. He says his mother-in-law was Lee's partner.  After spending almost every day with the man revered as a god-like figure within Shincheonji, Kim became disillusioned with the group and in 2017 he left.  The Shincheonji religious group's leader Lee Man-hee in Los Angeles.  The Promised Pastor  Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984, by Lee and is centered around the personality of its founder.  Little is known about his past.  According to the group's official homepage, Lee was born on September 15, 1931, in Cheongdo, in southern South Korea, and his birthplace gets regular visits from followers. Lee was "deeply religious" from an early age and prayed with his grandfather but had never been to a church.  The website heavily suggests that Lee is the "Promised Pastor" mentioned in the Bible. The passage it highlights suggests that the Promised Pastor is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  The group says it has about 245,000 members more than 31,000 of them from overseas.  Shincheonji's International Peace Youth Group event in 2014.  An internal document from 2017, called the "International Missions Department status report," provided to CNN by former members, said the group has eight branches in the US, with the LA chapter being the largest with more than 1,000 members, as well as dozens of chapters in China.  "The church of Shincheonji believes Lee Man-hee, their leader, is the second coming of Jesus Christ," says Kim.  CNN has tried to reach Lee Man-hee for comment, but multiple calls to the group have not been returned.  Across Korea, some churches have notices on their doors saying Shincheonji members are not welcome, claiming they infiltrate mainstream churches to recruit new members, according to Tark Ji-il, a professor at Busan Presbyterian University.  International gatherings  In the middle of January, as coronavirus took hold in central China, thousands of Shincheonji members assembled for an annual gathering in Gwacheon, where the group is headquartered, near Seoul.  Then, between January 31 and February 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral of the founder's brother. Local media reports that before his death on January 31, he was hospitalized at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital, near Daegu, the city at the heart of South Korea's outbreak.  Numerous confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths have since been recorded from the same hospital.  Shincheonji wasn't connected to the coronavirus outbreak until South Korea reported its 31st case on February 18. The patient, a 61-year-old South Korean woman, had no prior overseas travel history or contact with other confirmed cases.  Shincheonji's Annual General Assembly in Gwacheon, South Korea, on January 12, 2020.  A cluster of infections followed. By February 20, the national tally had increased from 31 to 156 and the first death was reported.  While tracing the movements of the 31st patient, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spotted a link between the new patients: case number 31 had attended a Shincheonji service with hundreds others in Daegu, a city of 2.4 million people about 280 kilometers (174 miles) south of Seoul.  Once the link to the religious group was established, authorities decided to quarantine all attendees of the meeting the 31st case had attended.  Spokesperson Simon Kim said in a recorded statement: "This is a disease that originated in China and spread to South Korea. We are sincerely urging everyone recognize that the Shincheonji Church and its devotees are the biggest victims of Covid-19, and refrain from hate and groundless attack."  Stopping the spread  One of Shincheonji's mass worship events.  In South Korea, officials have ordered all of the group's facilities to close. Shincheonji says it has close to 1,100 buildings and is disinfecting them to try to stem the spread of the virus.  On February 24, South Korea's Gyeonggi provincial governor, Lee Jae-myung, said in a radio interview with Korean station TBS, that the Shincheonji group had not initially cooperated with officials as promised. The group has 239 locations in Gyeonggi province, but only 100 of the addresses listed proved to be correct.  On February 26, Chairman Lee Man-hee posted a statement on the official Shincheonji website saying that the group has been "actively cooperating with the South Korean government to prevent the virus from spreading further" and they decided to hand over the list of the whole congregation and check on with everyone including the trainees on the condition that the government safeguard the private information.  On the same day, Gyeonggi Provincial government said 210 Shincheonji members had agreed to call 33,000 fellow members to ask about symptoms, as Shincheonji members often don't answer calls from nonmembers.  Daegu police deployed 600 officers to find hundreds of members, knocking on doors, tracking phones and scouring security camera footage to find them, and asking them to self-isolate.  It comes as more than half a million people this week reportedly signed an online petition filed to the president's office calling for Shincheonji to be dissolved. Any petition with over 200,000 signatures is guaranteed an official government response, putting the group under a spotlight it has tried for so many years to avoid.
2020-02-26	New York (CNN Business) Dow futures dropped 200 points, or 0.7%, in the early hours of Thursday after US health authorities said they've discovered a case of novel coronavirus in the country without knowing its origin.  S&P 500 SPX Nasdaq COMP Other major US indexes also declined in premarket trading.andfutures each fell 0.8%.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier that a resident of Solano County, California, tested positive for the virus without having "relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient." They warned that the case could indicate that the virus has begun moving through a community in the United States for the first time.  The CDC announcement also came as President Donald Trump tried to assuage fears about the outbreak . At a press conference Wednesday, he defended the White House's response to the disease and stressed that the administration has resources devoted to combating the virus. Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of the government's plan, he added.  CDC officials, though, have told Americans that health experts foresee the virus spreading in the United States.

2020-02-26	New York (CNN Business) The longest economic expansion in American history has survived an unprecedented trade war, a catastrophic tsunami in Japan and a severe crash in oil prices. The fast-moving coronavirus poses yet another grave test.  The emerging health crisis threatens to dim the brightest part of the United States, if not the world, economy: American wallets.  Resilient spending by consumers is the only thing that kept the United States out of recession during the height of the US-China trade war last year. Manufacturing collapsed. Business spending shrank. Yet Americans kept on shopping.  If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen."  The risk is that a health scare in the United States changes that formula, dealing another blow to the fragile world economy and threatening the expansion at home.  It's easy to imagine how a coronavirus outbreak like those gripping South Korea and Italy could cause Americans to hunker down, limiting visits to crowded restaurants, malls and airports.  "The American consumer is the firewall between an economy that's growing and one that's not," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNN Business. "If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen."  In light of the health scare, Zandi this week raised his probability of a recession in the United States during the first half of 2020 to 40% from 20%.  "If this is a pandemic and it does come here, I don't see how we avoid a downturn," he said.  Apple, Coke and MasterCard warn of trouble  For Corporate America, the coronavirus could pose a double-whammy. Not only are US companies experiencing costly disruptions to carefully calibrated supply chains, but they are bracing for weaker demand.  Until recently, health officials and economists thought the coronavirus was largely contained to China. And the picture in China appeared to be improving, albeit gradually. But the coronavirus has since spread to major economies including South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran.  "If you have one outbreak at one mall, one conference, behavior will change radically," said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors.  Kotok said that such an outbreak could spark a global recession, a risk that financial markets are just beginning to price in.  "As of today, American's don't see this as a domestic US problem. I hope, for the sake of our country, it doesn't break out here," said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. "But two weeks ago the South Koreans and the Italians didn't think it was a problem."  Trade war already weakened the world economy  The risk of further outbreak is heightened by the fact that the global economy is already teetering , in large part because of lingering damage from the US-China trade war.  And China, the epicenter of the coronavirus, was slowing before the crisis hit.  "The global economy was already on its backheels because of the trade war. And when you're on your back heels, all you need is a shove to fall backwards," said Zandi, the Moody's economist.  'Stay calm'  The good news is that the US economy has been extremely resilient. Previous shocks, including last decade's European debt crisis and the 2011 tsunami and earthquake in Japan proved fleeting. After each scare, the economy quickly rebounded, and those market freakouts turned out to be terrific buying opportunities for investors.  "Panicking during a sell-off has never been a good move," Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "We'd advise you to stay calm and not let your emotions get the best of you."  The US retail industry remains cautiously optimistic.  Despite "wildcards" like the coronavirus and the election, the National Retail Federation said Wednesday it still projects solid sales growth of 3.5% to 4.1% in 2020.  "With gains in household income and wealth, lower interest rates and strong consumer confidence, we expect another healthy year ahead," NRF CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement.  Goldman Sachs has trimmed its first quarter GDP forecast but still expects positive growth of 1.2% during the first quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tool is forecasting even stronger growth of 2.6%. Both are a far cry from recession territory.  US health authorities have had weeks to prepare for an outbreak. They have imposed travel restrictions and other steps aimed at preventing one.  "We are a long way from this impacting the US consumer dramatically. But it's a risk people are starting to price in, and rightfully so," said Daryl Jones, director of research at Hedgeye Risk Management.  Pressure on the Fed to act. But will it matter?  The latest evidence suggests that consumers are largely unfazed by recent coronavirus developments. Consumer confidence ticked up slightly in February from a downwardly revised January level, according to the Conference Board.  However, that could change quickly given the latest headlines on the coronavirus, and the steep drop in the stock market from its all-time highs.  The Dow plummeted more than 1,000 points Monday , something that has only occurred two other times in history. On a percentage basis, it was the market's worst day in two years, reflecting how ill-prepared investors were for bad news.  "If the market keeps going down 1,000 points a day, that will spook people very fast," said Zandi, the Moody's economist.  Investors are hoping that the Federal Reserve will once again come to the rescue with easy money. Markets are now pricing in a 78% chance of at least one interest rate cut by the June Fed meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . That's up from just 28% a month ago.  Unfortunately, central bankers are ill-equipped to fight pandemics.  The Fed has already used up some of its conventional ammo by cutting rates three times last year. The US central bank only has six rate cuts left before it hits zero, a level Fed officials have signaled they don't want to cross.  "It's a very inadequate firehose on a raging fire," said Zandi. "If we actually go into recession and this is in fact a pandemic, the Fed will run out of room very quickly."
2020-02-26	(CNN) There are "ongoing" conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for the novel coronavirus due to the rapid spread of the infection in Italy, South Korea and Japan, according to an agency spokesperson.  Currently, the United States is doing health screenings only for passengers who are flying in from China. Those screenings involve a temperature check and observations for symptoms.  At the time the CDC made the decision to start screening passengers from China, there were far fewer cases of the coronavirus in China than there are currently in Italy, South, Korea or Japan.  When the screening started on January 17, there were 45 reported cases of the new coronavirus in China. Japan currently has about three times that number of cases, Italy has about 10 times as many, and South Korea has more than 25 times as many.  "We're not changing our posture at the moment [but] every day we re-evaluate what we're doing and making sure that we're adjusting what we're doing to make sure we're hitting the right notes," the CDC spokesperson said.  In addition to airport screenings, there are travel restrictions for passengers arriving from China . Foreign nationals who have visited China in the past 14 days may not enter the United States. Citizens and residents may enter, but based on their travel and health history, they will have some level of restrictions on their movements for 14 days from the time they left China, according to the CDC.  At a press conference Wednesday night, President Trump said there could be travel restrictions placed on passengers from other countries such as South Korea and Italy.  "At a right time we might do that. Right now it's not the right time. But at a right time," Trump said.  When asked specifically about travelers from Italy, Trump said "at some point we may cut that off. At some point depending on what happens we may cut certain additional countries off, like we've had to do with China."  Some experts would like to see the airport health screenings expanded.  Dr. Arthur Reingold , head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said the "extrapolation" from China to the other countries "makes sense."  "I think if we're going to try and reduce the introduction of the virus in the United States, then presumably the answer is yes," said Reingold, a former CDC infectious disease epidemiologist.  There have been 400 cases in Italy and 12 deaths, 1,261 cases in South Korea and 12 deaths, and 147 cases in Japan, with hundreds more cases from Diamond Princess cruise passengers who disembarked in Japan.  Others think it would become unmanageable to monitor passengers from Italy, Japan and South Korea.  In 2018, more than 22 million passengers flew to the United States from the three countries combined, according to US Department of Transportation statistics  "It becomes really unwieldy and complicated," said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. "And eventually, even a week from now, that list of countries could potentially double."  He added that it made sense to screen passengers from China at the beginning of the outbreak, but that eventually it wouldn't be worth the expense and time.  "I think we've maxed out on the benefit of travel screening," he said. "It made sense when the passengers were coming from one country, and I think in some ways it was effective. But now we're really going to see diminishing returns."  Airport screening has long been controversial. Israel, for example, has abandoned it, with a health official there calling it "ineffective and inefficient."  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  In the United States, temperature and symptom checks haven't caught a single coronavirus case . However, another part of the screenings has worked better: At least two passengers read the information cards handed out during the screenings and sought medical care when they developed symptoms listed on the cards.  Globally, about 50% of the original exported cases were detected through temperature checks, according to Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.
2020-02-26	South Korea now has more than 1,260 cases of the novel coronavirus, including a US soldier stationed in the country. The death toll from the virus is over 2,700 worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China. CNN's Paula Hancocks reports.
2020-02-26	Hong Kong (CNN) The novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have entered a new stage, as cases continue to rise around the world , raising fears of a global pandemic, even as the situation stabilizes inside China.  World Health Organization (WHO) officials said Wednesday that for the first time, the number of daily cases reported outside China had exceeded the number those reported within the country where the outbreak began.  Since it was first identified in mid-December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has killed 2,800 worldwide. Though the vast majority of those deaths have occurred in Hubei, the province at the center of the initial outbreak, new self-sustaining outbreaks are fast expanding in Iran, Italy and South Korea.  At the end of Wednesday, China's National Health Commission's had recorded 78,497 cases in the mainland, and 2,744 deaths. Globally, 3,225 cases have now been confirmed outside of China, bringing the total number to 81,722.  The shift in focus from China to the rest of the world was further highlighted Wednesday, with the announcement that all passengers arriving in Beijing would be subject to a 14-day quarantine if they have recently traveled in affected countries.  'Aggressive containment'  In Washington, US President Donald Trump announced a new team dedicated to tackling the virus, led by Vice President Mike Pence.  "Mike will be working with the professionals, doctors and everybody else that's working," Trump said, adding that Pence will report directly to him. "Because of all we've done (so far), the risk to the American people remains very low."  "It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared," the President continued. "We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it. We hope it doesn't spread. There's a chance that it won't spread, too. And there's a chance that it will."  Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director for the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said the US should expect to see more cases of coronavirus.  "Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working, and it is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far," she said. "However, we do expect more cases. And this is a good time to prepare."  Trump's speech comes after cases of the virus were confirmed in South America -- they have now been reported in every continent but Antarctica  In Europe, officials are working overtime to stop a continent-wide outbreak, as the situation in Italy continues to worsen. More than 400 cases have been reported in the Southern European nation, the majority of those in the northern Lombardy region. Sporting and social events across northern Italy have been canceled over fears of spreading the virus.  More than 18 cases of the virus have been confirmed in both Germany and France, while two French patients have died from the disease.  South Korea outbreak  In Asia, the worst outbreak beyond mainland China is in South Korea, where more than 1,595 cases have been reported, including 12 deaths.  That outbreak appears to have begun in the southern city of Daegu, where around 700 of the cases have been reported, but it has since spread throughout the country, bringing with it travel restrictions and emergency measures.  The South Korean government has also rolled out a new phone app, which requires travelers entering the country to self-diagnose themselves and report any possible symptoms.  Joint US-South Korea military drills were called off Thursday due to the outbreak, after multiple members of the military were diagnosed with the virus.  An American soldier infected with the virus is being treated at Camp Humphreys, near the city of Pyeongtaek, the headquarters of the United States Forces Korea (USFK).  The soldier has been placed in negative pressure isolation to prevent the virus spreading, and is being monitored by medical professionals, Camp Humphreys Commander Michael Tremblay said.  The soldier is a 23-year-old man and is the first American service member to be confirmed with coronavirus.  In the US, the Pentagon said late Wednesday that it was prohibiting all non-essential Department of Defense travel to South Korea due to the outbreak.

MUST WATCH Tokyo 2020 preparation still underway despite coronavirus fears 02:47  Worldwide spread  Pressure is now growing on officials in Japan over plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, events for which are due to begin next month.  Around 150 cases have been confirmed in Japan, in addition to the almost 700 cases confirmed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarkation last week after 14-days of quarantine.  Tokyo 2020 officials said Thursday that they were not currently considering canceling the Olympic Torch relay, which begins on March 26, but will look into how to host it without increasing the risk of infection, including scaling down events and the number of spectators.  Speaking to CNN, Dick Pound, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said the IOC has never had to deal with a possible pandemic and that "we are in daily if not hourly contact with the World Health Organization and the specialized agencies" to understand the facts and tendencies of the on-going coronavirus threat.  As for potential scenarios if the Games were indeed under threat, Pound suggested the Olympics could "be postponed for a few months, postponed for a year" if necessary or "dispersed in parcels around the world."  "We're not anywhere near that kind of decision making process," he added.  Friday prayers have been canceled in Iran, after the worst outbreak in the Middle East saw a rapid spike in numbers this week.  Around 140 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Iran, and 19 deaths. Multiple neighboring countries have cut off travel to Iran, while Qatar has ordered the evacuation of citizens from the country, along with Kuwaitis who wish to leave Iran.  Sheikh Hamad al-Thank "issued directives to evacuate the citizens of the State of Qatar and citizens of the sisterly State of Kuwait, who are currently in Iran, due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus," Qatari state media reported.

MUST WATCH Trump blames media for coronavirus fears as top health officials issue stark warnings 04:46  Pandemic fears rattle markets  The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far held off on classifying the coronavirus' spread as a global pandemic, but the outbreak appears to be getting closer to meeting the global health body's definition of one.  Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said Tuesday that the situation has met two of the criteria for a pandemic: "the fact that this virus has caused illness -- including illness that has resulted in death -- and sustained person-to-person spread."  "As community spread is detected in more and more countries, the world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus," she said.  The situation has rattled global markets and led to concern about the long term economic impact of the virus, with the Dow posting major losses earlier this week, though the US market opened marginally higher Wednesday.  In a widely-criticized tweet Wednesday , Trump claimed that CNN and MSNBC "are doing everything possible to make the (virus) look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible."  He later blamed the stock market downturn on the Democratic presidential debates.
2020-02-26	(CNN) As the world scrambles to get to grips with the coronavirus outbreak, global sporting events are taking a hit.  The World Health Organization is preparing for a potential pandemic, so it seems the list of sports affected by the virus will grow.  There are fears Tokyo 2020 may be impacted but organizers insist preparations are going ahead as planned.  Here is a list of the major sporting events so far hit by the coronavirus.
2020-02-26	Tehran, Iran (CNN) Iran's novel coronavirus death toll has climbed to 19, with 139 confirmed cases of the sickness.  Despite the spread of the virus, President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that authorities won't quarantine any Iranian cities. He also warned about the virus becoming "a weapon at the hands of our enemies," as part of "propaganda" against the country.  Rouhani said the virus should not further cripple the country's economy.  Iran has the most coronavirus cases in the Middle East, and is in an ongoing state of economic crisis. US sanctions on the country have seen its currency tank and unemployment grow.  A worker disinfects a public bus amid efforts to contain the coronavirus in Tehran on Wednesday.  In China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus, reported fatal cases of coronavirus would put the death rate at around 2%. South Korea, another outbreak center for the sickness, would have a mortality rate from the virus of around 1% based on figures provided by that country. In Iran, according to numbers provided by the Iranian health ministry, the death rate from Covid-19 would be over 13%.  Read More
2020-02-26	New York (CNN Business) The spread of the coronavirus around the world is sending shockwaves through an oil market ill-prepared for a serious blow to energy demand.  The outbreak is the biggest shock to demand for oil since the 2008 financial crisis.  US crude tumbled another 3% on Thursday to around $47.25 a barrel. That's the lowest price since January 2019 and marks a 25% plunge from the recent peak of $63.27 a barrel on January 6.  For the week, oil has plunged more than 11%, underscoring the intensifying fears about the health crisis.  Read More
2020-02-26	(CNN) Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the novel coronavirus will spread in US communities, and a case announced on Wednesday might be the country's first instance of it.  Now, health officials say, is the time for people in the United States prepare -- for canceled events, closed schools and interrupted work, and for the potential of widespread illness.  No one knows what community spread could look like in the United States -- it could be mild or very severe. In case of an outbreak that spreads within US communities, what can you do to protect yourself and your family?  Here are 10 questions answered about how to prepare.  1. What should I buy?  The US Department of Homeland Security recommends on its website that, before a pandemic strikes, to store a two-week supply of water and food, as well as over-the-counter medications you tend to take.  "Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins," according to the department.  "In general for emergency preparedness, we encourage all households to have an emergency response kit," which could be used during any public health or severe weather emergency, said Jennifer Kertanis, president-elect of the National Association of County and City Health Officials  2. Are there places I should avoid?  The CDC has released travel warnings and alerts in relation to coronavirus disease.  As of Wednesday, the CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to mainland China and South Korea . Travel alerts for older people and people with chronic medical conditions to consider postponing nonessential travel have been issued for Italy Iran and Japan  Regarding whether there are places to avoid in your community, such as the grocery store or library, health officials recommend to simply be mindful of avoiding close contact with people who may be sick  Also, if you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.  3. Should I keep my child home from school?  If your child is sick, it's important to keep them home from school in order to protect other students from getting sick -- but if your child is not sick, monitor local school closings.  Widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus could lead to schools, child care centers and other places for mass gatherings experiencing more absenteeism and even shutting down if that precaution is needed, according to the CDC.  JUST WATCHED Iran: Schools, social events shut down in Iran over coronavirus fears Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iran: Schools, social events shut down in Iran over coronavirus fears 01:18  Closing schools or canceling gatherings in response to public health concerns are common actions that school districts have had to make before throughout history.  For the coronavirus, however, "one of the questions that is scientifically out there that will govern or drive how school closures are calculated is to what extent children themselves carry or transmit this virus," he said. "Scientifically we need to have a better understanding of to what extent children are carriers or transmitters of the virus -- the point of that is, it's premature right now based on the science to make uniform claims about what school closures may look like."  Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told her family that while they are not at risk right now, they should plan for what to do if their lives were significantly impacted, she said during a press briefing on Tuesday. She also said she called the children's school district about what would happen if schools need to close.  Messonnier said her agency wants people to understand their lives might be disrupted.  "We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad," she said, adding that while CDC officials hope the spread won't be severe in the United States, they are planning as if it could be.  4. Should I work from home?  Community spread of the virus could be reasonably mild or very severe -- but Americans should still talk to employers about whether working online will be an option if needed, according to the CDC  The CDC has even posted guidance on its website to help businesses and employers plan for possibly including telework or flexible sick leave policies into operations if there is significant spread of coronavirus across the country.  Sick employees shouldn't return to work until their temperature has stayed below 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) for at least 24 hours, without the help of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicine, the CDC said  Yet "what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place," Shah said.  "Although we believe, according to the US CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state," he said, adding because of that, "there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here."  5. What should I do about my medications?  Before a pandemic, it is recommended to periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure you have a continuous supply in your home if needed, according to the US Department of Homeland Security  Also, it could be helpful to get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them, for personal reference.  6. What if I have to go to the doctor?  Talk to your doctor's office about telehealth options.  Your doctor likely offers the option to conduct an appointment over the phone or via video conferencing, and if not, your doctor could recommend a physician who does.  7. Do I need a facemask?  The CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear facemasks.  Rather, the CDC recommends to only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have the novel coronavirus and are showing symptoms -- that is in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected.  Overall, the use of facemasks remains crucial for health workers and people who are caring for someone infected with the virus in close settings, such as a health care facility or at home, according to the CDC.  8. If I don't need a mask, how can I avoid getting sick?  There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease, so the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus, according to the CDC.  The CDC also notes that there are several things to do to prevent the spread of any respiratory diseases:  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throw the tissue away  Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects  Wash your hands often with soap and water  The proper way to wash your hands is for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating, after going to the bathroom and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  In general, the public should do "what you do every cold and flu season," said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state -- where the first US case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed.  Since it is currently flu season in the United States, the CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine -- it's not too late. Remember to also practice other good health habits too, such as managing stress and drinking plenty of fluids.  "Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now," Shah, of Maine CDC, said.  9. What if someone in my household has the virus -- or thinks they do?  The best way to first determine whether you have the virus is to get tested.  If you develop a fever, cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after travel from China, call your doctor right away. If you have had close contact with someone who has traveled and is showing those symptoms, you should call ahead to a doctor, according to the CDC  JUST WATCHED Coronavirus patient: Take it seriously, but keep calm Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus patient: Take it seriously, but keep calm 02:51  Your doctor will then work with your state's public health department and the CDC to determine if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus.  An infected person might not show symptoms for up to 14 days after exposure. That's especially worrisome because this novel coronavirus can be transmitted while a person isn't showing any symptoms . Fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and trouble breathing are some of the most common symptoms of the novel coronavirus.  If you are sick or suspect you are, the CDC recommends to stay home except to get medical care and separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.  Call ahead before visiting your doctor's office so that the office can make preparations to keep other people from getting infected or exposed to the virus.  In the case of suspected coronavirus, if you are sick , the CDC does recommend to wear a facemask -- and cover your coughs and sneezes, clean your hands often and avoid sharing personal household items with others, such as utensils, dishes or bedding.  10. What if I want more information?  If you have more questions about the novel coronavirus, reach out to your local health department or find more information on the CDC's website at www.cdc.gov  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  "One of the things that local health departments and state health departments are really doing is trying to make sure that we're getting the best information out so that we're quelling fear but at the same time leaning forward and preparing people as this continues to grow and develop," said Kertanis, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.  "In any type of situation like this where we're dealing with a new illness, something that's growing and changing rapidly, it's almost fear of the unknown," she said.  Experts have said that the most important thing you can do is not panic and stay informed.  "We really want to urge everyone to avoid dubious sources of information and stick with trusted sources like their state health departments or the US CDC," Shah said. "We're in a situation where fear and misinformation can spread more quickly than this virus."
2020-02-27	The US has confirmed its 64th coronavirus case.  The new case was reported Friday in Solano County, California, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed with Solano County Public Health.  The individual was a Travis Air Force Base evacuee and passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, the county confirmed in a press release.  Another Solano County resident and Travis Air Force Base evacuee also tested positive by Japanese testing. This case -- which would be the 65th in the US -- is pending confirmation from the CDC.
2020-02-27	Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images  South Korea reported 256 more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday morning, bringing the national total to 2,022, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  The KCDC did not report any new deaths, meaning that the national death toll remains at 13.  Among the 256 new cases, 182 are from Daegu, the epicenter of the outbreak in South Korea. A total of 1,314 cases since the beginning of the outbreak have come from Daegu, according to the KCDC.  An additional 49 cases are from North Gyeongsang Province, which surrounds Daegu city.
2020-02-27	Hong Kong (CNN) Everyone knows the feeling. It's day six of a two-week course of antibiotics, and you're feeling much better. You're ready for a return to normality, to being able to drink alcohol and eat what you want without worry , to not stressing about taking your pills at the right time.  Of course, as most people (hopefully) know, stopping antibiotics at this point is the worst possible move, risking a return of the infection or enabling the bug to develop resistance to medicine , potentially putting more people at risk down the line. And yet many people still do it, because it's hard, when things feel like they're going back to normal, to continue to follow medical precautions, particularly ones that effect our day-to-day lives.  A similar dynamic is developing with the novel coronavirus. Even as new outbreaks are reported around the world and we edge towards pandemic levels, the situation is stabilizing in some areas where infections were first detected and people are starting to return to normality.  In China particularly, there has been a major drop in the number of new cases reported in the past week, particularly outside of Hubei, the province where the outbreak began. This has led some areas to lower travel restrictions and begin the slow process of getting back to work.  Liaoning, a province in northeastern China that borders North Korea, was the first to downgrade the coronavirus emergency response level from the highest level -- Level 1 -- to Level 3 on Saturday, according to a statement by the provincial government. This was followed by Shanxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Gansu and Guizhou, accounting for some 305 million people.  In Hong Kong too, where actions taken by the semi-autonomous Chinese city appear to have avoided an outbreak on the scale of the 2003 SARS crisis, there is a sense of very gradual relaxation. Although two people have died from the virus and the number of confirmed cases continues to rise -- it is now more than 90 -- an increasing number of the city's residents are beginning to slowly venture back out and about again. Some are even dispensing with face masks, previously a rare sight.  The relative success of Hong Kong in preventing the type of fast expanding mass outbreaks seen first in mainland China and now South Korea and other countries is likely due to the effectiveness of precautions, including closing schools and having large numbers of residents work at home to increase social distancing.  But as time goes on, and as cabin fever grows, it's only natural for people to feel like it's maybe time to go back to the office -- despite the potential risk. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong government announced a major economic relief package , boosting, perhaps unintentionally, the sense that the worst may have passed.  JUST WATCHED Coronavirus angst could turn into an economic crisis Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus angst could turn into an economic crisis 03:04  Mixed messages  While a desire to return to normal after weeks of paranoia and quarantine is understandable, the danger may be far from over, particularly in mainland China.  Since the outbreak began in December last year, more than 78,000 cases have been confirmed inside of Mainland China, with the death toll rising to more than 2,700.  Serious questions remain over the accuracy of the country's data on the virus, however, with multiple shifts in how cases are reported or categorized . Outside of Hubei itself, where a huge amount of resources and emergency staff have been deployed, there are fears that cases may be missed or go undiagnosed.  Even if the data is accurate, and the number of cases is stabilizing, it may be weeks before it is safe for people to be moving around freely again or gathering in large numbers. We know that the virus can lie dormant and there is strong evidence that it is spread while people are asymptomatic.  This was presumably the thinking behind postponing the annual meeting of China's rubber-stamp parliament , which was due to open on March 5 in Beijing.  But the messaging from the Chinese authorities has been mixed at best and often somewhat contradictory.  State media has been playing up stories of perseverance and self-sacrifice , while the country's censors have been going after any criticism of the government and clamping down on VPNs used to bypass the Great Firewall. At the same time, many foreign media websites have been blocked, and Chinese authorities have criticized some coverage by the international press.  Taking matters a step further, the central propaganda authorities announced they will soon publish a book -- in six different languages -- on China's efforts to combat the virus, with a focus on President Xi Jinping's "outstanding leadership, strategic vision, sense of mission and care for the people."  And yet, amid these "mission accomplished" vibes, Xi himself warned Wednesday that "the situation in Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan remains complex and grim, and the risk of a rebound of the epidemic in other regions can not be overlooked."  Economic pain  Economically, the coronavirus has already had a major toll , affecting everything from property sales to box office receipts, and leaving many businesses shuttered for weeks as employees remain under quarantine.  Writing Wednesday , Mark Williams, an analyst at Capital Economics, said that the Chinese economy "will contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, for the first time since at least the 1990s." While a stimulus package is in the works, it will likely not prevent a slowdown in annual growth.  Hong Kong is also feeling the pinch. The city was already in a technical recession following months of protests last year and the virus outbreak and accompanying slowdown has only made the situation worse . While some analysts said the cash payout announced by the government this week could help stimulate the economy, officials have warned it could take up to three months for people to actually receive the money.  If the initial outbreak has been devastating for the Chinese economy, a second could be even worse, further undermining confidence and adding more strain to businesses already teetering. It could also potentially lead to widespread discontent with the government, particularly as it has been pushing the narrative that it is on top of things.  China's leaders have taken dramatic steps to rein in the virus, quarantining millions of people and putting much of the country on lockdown. Were these to have turned out to be for nothing, the public anger could be massive.  At the same time, there's only so long you can expect people to put up with what are often extremely limiting restrictions, particularly when the immediate danger appears to have passed.  China's leaders undoubtedly understand these risks, and will be weighing them against the costs of keeping so much of the country out of work for so long. Hopefully a gradual return to normality will be just that, rather than a window for the outbreak to rebound.

A global coronavirus: Travel bans, face masks, and fear  Florian Gaertner/Getty Images In this photo illustration, a woman sprays disinfectant onto her hands in Berlin, Germany, on February 26. As the novel coronavirus spreads across Asia, people have rushed to stock up on sanitation and cleaning products. In major cities like Hong Kong, stores sold out of hand sanitizer, toilet rolls, face masks, disinfecting wipes, and more.  The novel coronavirus has gone global. What had begun as an outbreak in China is now threatening to become a worldwide pandemic, having reached every continent except Antarctica.  Since it was first identified in mid-December, the virus has killed more than 2,800 worldwide. Though the vast majority of those deaths have occurred in Hubei, the province at the center of the initial outbreak, new clusters are fast expanding outside of China, in countries as diverse as Iran, Italy and South Korea.  In the past week alone, 20 countries confirmed their first cases of the coronavirus, mostly in Europe and the Middle East.  On Wednesday, for the first time, there were more cases reported outside China that inside, according to data from the World Health Organization.  Globally, more than 3,200 cases have now been confirmed outside of China, bringing the total number to more than 82,000.  As anxiety and fear spreads around the world, international authorities are scrambling to contain the virus. Numerous countries are closing borders, placing cities on lockdown, and implementing stringent quarantine measures; Italy has effectively quarantined 100,000 people.  This rise in public fear has seen shops in Italy and other hard-hit regions sell out of medical supplies like face masks -- an echo of the same panic buying that had gripped Asia just earlier this month.  And though the WHO has yet to call the outbreak a pandemic, international experts are warning that people should get ready for such an escalation.  "Ultimately we expect we will see community spread in this country," said Nancy Messonnier, a director at the US Center of Disease Control and Prevention. "It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."

2020-02-27	(CNN) Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that it's not a question of if, but when the novel coronavirus will spread in the United States -- and communities are urged to prepare for the virus that has already killed thousands and sickened 10s of thousands more worldwide.  How could the possible spread of coronavirus change our daily lives? Schools, businesses, hospitals and first responders could all be impacted, according to the CDC  "We expect we will see community spread in this country," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press briefing Tuesday.  "We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad."  The CDC has been referring to guidance on how to deal with flu pandemics, in a document called "Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017." It's the "blueprint" for community interventions, and the agency is adjusting its recommendations to the specific circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak, officials said.  The document draws from the findings of nearly 200 journal articles written between 1990 and 2016, and it includes a summary of lessons learned from the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which killed hundreds of thousands globally.  "The trajectory of what we're looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain, but many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza and our experience going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps that our health care system, our businesses, our communities and schools may need to take," Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, said during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.  "It's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off and make sure that they're ready."  Some schools and social events could shut down  Widespread transmission of the coronavirus could impact schools, child care centers, colleges and group events, such as concerts, festivals, and sporting events, according to the CDC's 2017 document.  For instance, the document notes that "social distancing measures" for schools, workplaces and gatherings "can reduce virus transmission by decreasing the frequency and duration of social contact among persons of all ages."  In schools, that could involve dividing classes into smaller groups of students and rearranging desks so students are spaced at least 3 feet from each other in a classroom, according to the document. That is, if the school remains open.  JUST WATCHED Iran: Schools, social events shut down in Iran over coronavirus fears Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iran: Schools, social events shut down in Iran over coronavirus fears 01:18  Closing or canceling schools in response to public health concerns are decisions that districts typically have to grapple with and are already experienced in making.  For the novel coronavirus, "one of the questions that is scientifically out there that will govern or drive how school closures are calculated is to what extent children themselves carry or transmit this virus," Shah said. "Scientifically we need to have a better understanding of to what extent children are carriers or transmitters of the virus -- the point of that is, it's premature right now based on the science to make uniform claims about what school closures may look like."  Messonnier said on Tuesday that she talked to her family and told them, while they are not at risk right now, they should have a plan in case their lives are significantly impacted. She said she even called the children's school district to find out what would happen if schools needed to close.  "The data over the last week, and the spread in other countries, has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation" of community spread, she said.  The CDC still doesn't know what that will look like, she added. Community spread could be reasonably mild or very severe.  You might be urged to work from home  The CDC has posted guidance on its website to help businesses and employers make decisions on work-from-home policies or flexible sick leave if there is significant spread of the coronavirus across the country.  Such guidance also includes how to respond if an employee gets sick.  The 2017 document noted that "social distancing measures that reduce face-to-face contact in workplaces might include offering telework and remote meeting options. Flexible sick leave policies should be implemented to encourage workers to stay home if needed."  Also according to the document, "CDC recommends environmental surface cleaning measures in all settings, including homes, schools, and workplaces, to remove influenza viruses from frequently touched surfaces and objects."  Yet overall, "what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place," Shah said.  "Although we believe, according to the US CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state," he said, adding because of that, "there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here."  First responders may have to act  With the spread of disease, health care systems could become taxed with high rates of hospitalizations and deaths -- and it could impact other critical infrastructure, too, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and the transportation industry, according to the CDC.  Many state health departments are already in talks with emergency medical technicians, paramedics, firefighters and other first responders to plan how to handle sick patients while remaining healthy themselves in case the virus spreads through the community. Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications have been approved, yet, to treat it.  "What this looks like, again, will vary greatly community by community, city by city, state by state," Shah said.  The CDC has produced more than 23 guidance documents on infection control, hospital preparedness, personal protective equipment supplies and clinical evaluation and management to help first responders and health systems prepare for the possible spread of the disease.  Those preparations include making sure enough supplies are available for response efforts.  For instance, Shah said his colleagues at the CDC have already taken an inventory of their personal protective equipment -- such as gowns, masks and respirators -- and have put in an order for additional supplies, as have many other state health departments.  "We are anticipating what potential needs the health care system in Maine, and New England as a whole, may have for those supplies and we're trying to think as many steps in advance as we can," he said.  A call to stay informed  While federal, state and local health departments are staying on top of preparation efforts, Shah has several suggestions on how average Americans can get prepared, too.  "I'm recommending a few things. The first is to urge everyone to keep themselves and their families as healthy as possible. Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now. The other thing we're recommending is that folks stay informed," Shah said.  "We really want to urge everyone to avoid dubious sources of information and stick with trusted sources like their state health departments or the US CDC," he said. "We're in a situation where fear and misinformation can spread more quickly than this virus."

"These are really concrete things that everybody can start doing today, so that if we get into a scenario where the situation becomes more concerning nationwide, everyone is ready, not just health departments," Shah said.
2020-02-27	New York (CNN Business) It's been a difficult year for the seller of Corona, Budweiser and Stella Artois — and 2020 doesn't look much better.  The company's sales grew tepidly last year. Costs are up. And coronavirus has killed demand for alcoholic drinks in China.

2020-02-27	(CNN) President Donald Trump wants America to know he's doing a great job in keeping out the novel coronavirus, in a victory lap that could look premature if his own experts are correct in their more somber forecasts.  The President spoke at a news conference on Wednesday about the worldwide health emergency that has seen the virus sweep into South Korea, Italy and every continent but Antarctica, sounding as if the danger had already passed rather than was yet to arrive.  "The risk to the American people remains very low," Trump said, as he unveiled his big announcement: Vice President Mike Pence will head the government effort.  The President's optimistic performance came hours before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a patient in California who has the novel coronavirus might be the first person to be infected who did not travel to an afflicted region and was not exposed to another known carrier. The case raises the ominous possibility that the virus is already moving through the community.  In anxious times, including health emergencies, presidents are called upon to show authority and credible planning and to inspire confidence and national unity among Americans. The task is especially complicated for Trump, given the three years of divide-and-rule politics he has used to cement power, which has deepened mistrust among voters who do not support him.  His upbeat, election-year tone contrasted sharply with predictions from his government experts, who are warning of possible severe disruption to American life if the outbreak swells into a pandemic.  He enlisted some of those officials, who he touted as " tremendously talented ," in a rare appearance in the White House briefing room amid rising criticism that his administration's response to the virus is too little, too late.  Trump's main message was that there is nothing "inevitable" about a US outbreak. The President also claimed credit for his own wise steps that he said had kept Americans safe -- no thanks to Democrats, he said, who have branded his approach to a possible pandemic as small ball.  "We've done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum," the President said, crediting his early curbs on travel from China.  "Had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area, we wouldn't be talking this way. ... I took a lot of heat; some people called me racist."  His comments, taken literally, ought to have quelled any sense of panic. But the President's incessant political gamesmanship will make it difficult for many viewers to shed suspicion he was minimizing the situation for personal gain.  Presidents lead in fearful times  Trump's main aim Wednesday seemed to be to minimize the threat. He went out of his way to compare the novel coronavirus to the seasonal flu -- and marveled that so many Americans succumb to that ailment each year.  Presidents get judged on their handling of national crises. And Trump's appearance left many questions unanswered. Among them is whether he will be guided by science or politics in fighting the virus. Another is whether he has the capacity to rally the nation behind him if things take a turn for the worse. It's not a given that Trump has the self-discipline to manage the emergency and avoid counterproductive political grandstanding.  The President can be sure of staunch support from his base whatever happens, so any sense that a botched response could do for his presidency what the disastrous Hurricane Katrina relief effort did for George W. Bush may not materialize.  The imprecision of Trump's language Wednesday did not exactly inspire confidence, when he was asked if Americans should brace for a severe coronavirus outbreak.  "I don't think it is inevitable. I think we are doing a really good job. There is a chance it could get worse. There is a chance if could get fairly, substantially worse. Nothing is inevitable," the President said in a vague summary of scenarios.  He also preferred to focus on the cases of small numbers of Americans repatriated from Japan and China who developed the virus and are in quarantine, rather than the specter of a possible large-scale US epidemic that his officials fear.  "We're going to be pretty soon at only five people. We could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time," Trump said.  Yet health experts have said it is all but certain the coronavirus will end up being transmitted within the US given its rapid spread around Asia and Europe and across the world.  An awkward spot for health bureaucrats  Government health experts onstage with Trump had to tread a difficult line -- between honoring their professional assessments and avoiding angering the President, who dislikes being contradicted.  "Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far. However, we do expect more cases, and this is a good time to prepare," said Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, delivered the sobering news that even with an unusually accelerated process of development and testing, it could be a year to a year-and-a-half before a vaccine becomes available. His assessment contrasts with Trump's hints that inoculations are just around the corner.  As is often the case in Trump's presidency, nonpartisan career officials were forced to stand by his side as he unleashed flaming attacks on political opponents -- in this case House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had suggested to CNN earlier that he did not know what he was talking about on the coronavirus.  "I think Speaker Pelosi is incompetent. ... She is trying to create a panic and there's no reason to panic because we have done so good," Trump said, with Schuchat -- wearing a neutral expression -- beside him in the camera shot.

MUST WATCH Life around Italy's coronavirus 'red zone' 02:31  A dividing line in tone and professionalism became clear between the politicians, who took time out for obligatory praise of Trump, and the professionals.  "The President's early and decisive actions, including travel restrictions, have succeeded in buying us incredibly valuable time," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.  Pence, whose new responsibility might turn into a poisoned political chalice if the outbreak reaches America and exacts a heavy toll, also lauded Trump.  "From the first word of an outbreak of the coronavirus, the President took unprecedented steps to protect the American people from the spread of this disease," he said.  Confusion about the exact division of responsibilities between Pence and Azar suggests a not entirely smooth plan.  "I'm still chairman of the task force," Azar said, adding, "I was delighted that I'd get to have the vice president helping me. Delighted."  Such a hierarchy did not seem to be what the President had in mind when he said, "I'm going to be putting our Vice President Mike Pence in charge ... he's got a certain talent for this."
2020-02-27	Washington (CNN) The US Navy has ordered all ships that have visited countries in the Pacific region to effectively self-quarantine and remain at sea for 14 days in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms of coronavirus.  "Out of an abundance of caution, Pacific Fleet is implementing additional mitigations to prevent Sailors from contracting COVID-19, and to monitor Sailors who have traveled to higher-risk areas," US Navy spokesman Lt. James Adams told CNN, using the official name for the virus.  The spokesman said that "at this time, there are no indications that any US Navy personnel have contracted Coronavirus Disease 2019," but added later that the Navy was acting out of an abundance of caution. "The health and welfare of our sailors, civilians and their families is paramount and our efforts are directed at detection and, if required, prevention of the spread of this illness," the spokesman said.  The commander of US Navy's Pacific Fleet, Adm. John Aquilino, issued guidance instructing Navy vessels departing from countries in the region "to remain at sea for at least 14 days before pulling into another port, in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms of the virus."

2020-02-27	(CNN) A whistleblower at the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking federal protection after complaining that more than a dozen workers who received the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, lacked proper training or protective gear for coronavirus infection control.  "We are hopeful that Congress and the OSC will investigate this case in a timely and comprehensive manner," Ari Wilkenfeld, a lawyer for the whistleblower, told CNN. "This matter concerns HHS's response to the coronavirus, and its failure to protect its employees and potentially the public. The retaliatory efforts to intimidate and silence our client must be opposed."  The House Ways and Means Committee sent letters to Health and Human Services Secretary Alexander Azar, the HHS Deputy Inspector General, and the comptroller's office requesting more information after the complaint was submitted.  "The report alleges that staff were sent into quarantined areas 'without personal protective equipment, training, or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols, and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,'" the letter states. "The whistleblower also reported that when staff raised safety concerns, they were 'admonished by (redacted) for 'decreasing staff morale,' accused of not being team players, and had their mental health and emotional stability questioned.'"

2020-02-27	(CNN) The US and South Korean militaries announced Thursday that they will postpone a command post training exercise due to growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in South Korea, which has infected 25 members of the South Korean military and one US servicemember.  "The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance has decided to postpone the joint combined command post training planned for the first half of this year until further notice, as the South Korean government has raised the alert level to the highest level due to COVID-19," Kim Joon-Rak, a spokesman for the South Korean military's Joint Chief of Staff said at a news conference Thursday, using the official name for the virus.  "The containment efforts of COVID-19 and the safety of (Republic of Korea) and U.S. service members were prioritized in making this decision," US Army Col. Lee Peters, a spokesman for US Forces Korea, said Thursday.  South Korea has recently confirmed 334 additional cases of novel coronavirus across the country, bringing the national total of confirmed cases to 1,595, according to the South Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  Those figures include 25 members of the South Korean military, according to the South Korean defense ministry.  Read More
2020-02-27	London (CNN Business) A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here .  Global stocks have entered their sixth straight trading day in the red as investors worry that the coronavirus outbreak is fast becoming a pandemic — with Britain's FTSE 100 flirting with a correction.  The exporter-heavy index fell another 1.9% on Thursday, bringing its slide for the week up to nearly 7%. The FTSE 100 is nearly 10% below its recent closing high in mid-January.  Other indexes aren't far behind. In South Korea, the site of the largest outbreak outside China , the Kospi index is more than 9% off its recent January high. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 are also nearing correction territory.  The S&P 500, which has dropped in six of the past seven trading sessions, is 8% off an all-time high reached just last week.  Driving the market: A weakening outlook for global economic growth as countries race to contain the coronavirus' spread. Bank of America has cut its forecast for global growth to 2.8%, which would be the lowest reading since 2009.  Microsoft MSFT The market unease also reflects the steady stream of companies warning that the coronavirus outbreak is hurting their business.said Wednesday that it won't meet its revenue guidance issued in late January, citing weaker sales for Windows and Surface laptops. On Thursday, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, said it has lost $285 million in revenue in China due to the virus in January and February alone.  Goldman Sachs now estimates that US companies will generate no earnings growth in 2020. In the near term, the investment bank thinks that the S&P 500 will fall another 7%.  Still dropping: The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, now below 1.30%, continues to hit new lows as investors seek out safe haven investments.  Oil has also continued its decline on concerns about waning demand in the event of a prolonged global slowdown. US oil futures are off another 2.3% to $47.61 per barrel, while Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, are down 2% to $52.34 per barrel.  Big picture: President Donald Trump's news conference and the US government response has not assuaged investors' anxiety as cases outside China continue to rise.  Apple will open its first store in India. Is it too late?  India is finally getting an Apple Store — but the company could still find it hard to catch up in a crucial market for Big Tech.  The plans: The store will open in 2021, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. The iPhone maker also plans to launch online sales in India this year.  Why it took so long: Indian regulations require foreign retailers to source at least 30% of their raw materials locally. Apple has long sought an exemption from that rule and instead sold its devices through partner stores, my CNN Business colleague Michelle Toh reports. Cook told shareholders that the company "needed to get approval from the government to go in there ourselves."  Apple AAPL has struggled for years to gain traction in the huge market. A big problem is price: A high-end iPhone can cost more than the country's average annual wage. Instead, Xioami and Samsung have dominated.  Apple finished 2019 in sixth place. The challenge for Cook will be leveraging a cheaper iPhone 11 to claw the company's way higher.  Its efforts come as Big Tech's honeymoon in India reaches an end . The country is making changes which could make it harder for global tech firms to cash in over the next decade.  What's happening: A raft of regulations in the works will affect how companies — particularly foreign ones — collect and store data, sell products online and protect their users' privacy.  How the coronavirus could spark a US recession  The longest economic expansion in American history has survived a trade war with China, a catastrophic tsunami in Japan and a severe crash in oil prices. The fast-moving coronavirus poses yet another grave test, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan writes  Resilient spending by consumers kept the United States out of recession during the height of the trade war last year. Manufacturing collapsed. Business spending shrank. Yet Americans kept on shopping. The risk is that a health scare in the United States changes that balance.  "If the American consumer loses faith, and the coronavirus will be a real test of faith, then a recession is going to happen," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told Matt.

2020-02-27	Hong Kong (CNN) Stock markets in the US have posted some of their worst ever losses as the novel coronavirus sparked mass sell-offs.  Markets in Asia and elsewhere have also suffered, as fears of a global pandemic have continued to grow. First cases of the virus were confirmed in New Zealand, Belarus and Lithuania on Friday, as outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran continued to worsen.  In the US, opposition lawmakers criticized President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis and raised concerns over his placing of Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the response, pointing to Pence's track record as Indiana governor during an HIV epidemic  Trump said his Democratic opponents were refusing to give his administration credit where it was due for their response to the virus. "While they were working on impeachment, we were working on doing this," he said. "Because we were hearing about it."  Trump added that the virus is "going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear. And from our shores, you know, it could get worse before it gets better. Could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows."

MUST WATCH Pence's history managing health crisis under scrutiny 03:06  Asia in crisis  While the virus has spread worldwide, the worst of the outbreak remains centered in Asia.  The number of confirmed cases in China grew to 78,824 as of Friday morning, an increase of 327 from the previous day. Forty-four people died of the virus on Thursday, bringing the total in mainland China to 2,788. More than 36,000 patients have been discharged from hospital so far.  The number of new cases has eased significantly in the past week, raising hopes that people will soon be able to go back to work after weeks of self-imposed or mandatory quarantine. There are fears however that an early return could spark new outbreaks, as the virus can take up to two-weeks to show symptoms.  In Japan, the ongoing outbreak has raised questions over the viability of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. While the Games themselves aren't until July, events such as the torch relay are due to begin next month.  Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, said, "we are working extremely closely with the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, and are providing them with risk assessment and risk management advice."  "No decision has or will be taken in the near term regarding the future of the Olympics," he said.  Ryan cautioned, it's not just the Olympics they are advising on, but all mass gatherings, including religious or sports events.  Many events in the past have gone ahead during outbreaks, such as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics which continued during an outbreak of Zika virus, Ryan added.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday announced that all schools will be closed from Monday, while the country will ramp up production of face masks, with the aim to have five hundred million made in a month.  While cases have spiked alarmingly in Japan -- to over 900 -- most still remain centered around the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which began disembarkation last week after a 14-day quarantine. There are fears the quarantine failed to prevent the virus spreading however, and smaller outbreaks elsewhere in Japan appear to be self-sustaining.  In neighboring South Korea, the number of cases has risen to over 2,000, the most outside mainland China, with at least 13 deaths.  Seoul and Washington announced Thursday they were postponing joint military drills, as the virus has spread through the large number of American and Korean troops stationed on the peninsula.  The South Korean Defense Ministry announced that there are 26 confirmed cases in the country's military, while almost 10,000 troops are in quarantine. Three cases have been confirmed to have links to US Forces Korea.  JUST WATCHED Gupta on Trump's coronavirus claim: That's not true Replay More Videos ...

That could have a major effect on the country's economy, with the Italian finance minister saying Thursday that the four most affected regions make up 50% of the country's GDP. The outbreak could also have a major affect on tourism, a big driver of the Italian economy.  At present, Italy does not plan to close its borders, Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri said.  "I don't think right now there is any reason to close the border, especially because the two areas are very well confined and we know exactly the two major outbreaks and all the people that we found all around Italy -- which are very few -- are coming from that area," Sileri said.  "I think paranoia and anxiousness and panic will run much much more than the virus and we had problem with this in the last few weeks," he added. "This is the first epidemic event in era of social media, and this doesn't help, absolutely doesn't help."  There is evidence that the Italian outbreak has already spread beyond its borders , with Spain, Germany, Denmark and the UK reporting cases among travelers who had been in Italy.  The need to respond to the health crisis is revealing -- and fueling -- longstanding rifts within the European Union  "There is a feeling in Italy that the numbers are high because the government has been aggressive in its policy response," Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group told CNN. "There is also a feeling that other member states have lower numbers because they haven't been aggressive."  In the Middle East, numerous countries have cut off travel to Iran, where at least 245 cases and 26 deaths have been confirmed so far. Iranian authorities canceled Friday prayers this week in an attempt to reduce transmission.

Another Solano County resident and Travis Air Force Base evacuee also tested positive by Japanese testing. This case -- which would be the 65th in the US -- is pending confirmation from the CDC.
2020-02-28	Hong Kong (CNN Business) Countries around the world have been eager to cash in on the rising spending power of Chinese travelers . Shops advertise Mandarin speaking salespeople, the United States and Japan offer 10-year visas, and hotels and duty-free retailers accept China's Alipay and WeChat Pay apps.  The travel boom has come to a screeching halt since late January, when the novel coronavirus outbreak hit mainland China, and it could be years before the global tourism industry recovers.  To contain the virus, millions of Chinese are hunkering down, flights have been canceled and countries are imposing restrictions on anyone coming from mainland China.  The knock-on effects are being felt around the globe. Tour groups and cruise lines are canceling trips because of plummeting demand. International fairs and conferences from Hong Kong to Italy are being shelved. And hotels that are usually teeming with Chinese tourists are sitting empty.  Billions of dollars of Chinese spending are at stake  The number of Chinese tourists has skyrocketed in recent years. More than 180 million Chinese have passports, compared to about 147 million American passport holders. And when Chinese travel abroad, they spend big bucks.  Beijing's brand new Daxing International Airport is near empty, with Chinese travelers staying home because of the coronavirus outbreak.  Chinese tourists made 150 million outbound trips in 2018, spending a whopping $277 billion in their travels abroad, according to the United Nations World Trade Organization.  Hong Kong and Macao, both major destinations for mainland tourists, will suffer, too. Around Asia, the influx of Chinese travelers has been a boon. Last year, the top 10 destinations for mainland Chinese travelers were all in Asia, according to China Outbound Tourism Research. That means places like Thailand, Japan South Korea and Vietnam have a lot to lose from the crippling viral outbreak.Hong Kong and Macao, both major destinations for mainland tourists, will suffer, too.  "China is the single largest outbound travel market in the world, in terms of spending," Matthew Dass, an economist with Tourism Economics, said in a research note earlier this month.  Tourism Economics downgraded its 2020 forecast for Chinese departures because of the coronavirus earlier this month. The firm said that if the outbreak lasts longer and is more severe than the 2003 SARS crisis, it could lead to 25 million fewer outbound trips by Chinese travelers this year. That could wipe out as much as $73 billion in spending.  The International Civil Aviation Organization said the hardest hit countries will likely be Japan and Thailand.  The organization estimated earlier this month that Japan could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue, followed by Thailand at $1.15 billion.  "This outbreak is beyond anyone's imagination," Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com, told CNN Business on Monday.  Trip.com, China's largest online travel platform, was supposed to release fourth quarter earnings this week, but delayed them until the middle of March. The company also owns and operates Skyscanner and Ctrip.  The final numbers are still being crunched, but Sun said the company will "of course" take a hit from the outbreak. She warned that the impact to her company and the travel industry during this quarter "might be significant."  Hotels and airlines face steep losses  Marriott MAR said on Thursday that it is experiencing low occupancy throughout the Asia Pacific region because of the outbreak. In Macao, occupancy plummeted to 1% at one point, CEO and president Arne Sorenson said on a call with investors. The semi-autonomous Chinese territory, one of the world's top gambling hubs, closed casinos for two weeks this month because of the outbreak.  Marriott executives warned that the company could take in $60 million less in fees and earnings for the region than it originally expected for the quarter.  As the outbreak spreads to other countries, Marriott hotels in Europe and beyond are also starting to feel the pain.  "When you look at South Korea and Italy, we will see both cancellations and we will see declining (revenue per available room) in those markets," said Sorenson. "Some of the Italian cities, we've probably lost a few tens of points of occupancy in the first days."  Hilton HLT During an earnings call earlier this month,executives warned of likely declines in bookings from outbound Chinese travelers in Asia and the United States. The outbreak will carve between $25 million to $50 million from the company's full year earnings, said CEO and president Christopher Nassetta.  The global airline industry is also facing huge financial losses and its first traffic decline in more than a decade because of the coronavirus.  The International Air Transport Authority (IATA) warned last week that the impact on demand could cost airlines more than $29 billion.  The outbreak will also likely reduce global traffic by 4.7%, wiping out IATA's earlier forecast for growth and marking the first overall decline in demand since the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.  The Hong Kong International Airport is largely empty these days. IATA estimates the hit to global airlines could top $29 billion.  Dozens of international carriers have canceled or reduced services to mainland China.  Air France-KLM AFLYY warned that its earnings could fall by as much as $216 million between February and April because of the outbreak.  Qantas Airlines QABSY wipe $100 million off of pre-tax profit from the second half of the company's fiscal year. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia.

Cruise industry in crisis  China was expected to become the world's largest cruise market by 2030, according to a recent study from the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. The crisis aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship could derail that plan.  The vessel became a floating quarantine zone earlier this month , after dozens of passengers were stricken with the coronavirus. About 700 cases, including at least four deaths, have been linked to the outbreak on the ship.  JUST WATCHED Coronavirus concerns hurt cruise industry Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus concerns hurt cruise industry 01:35  "China could be closed to cruise travel for a year or more and even once it reopens, many potential consumers may have a negative association with cruise travel, which could limit the long-term growth trajectory," said James Hardiman, an analyst with Wedbush.  China was the second largest market for cruise ship passengers in 2018, with nearly 2.4 million Chinese sailing that year, according to the most recent global passenger report from Cruise Lines International Association. The United States remained the top market, with more than 13 million Americans traveling on a cruise in 2018.  Ingrid Leung, the managing director of Incruising Travel Asia, a Hong Kong-based travel company that sells cruise packages, said new bookings are currently down 95%.  Carnival CCL That's partly because Princess Cruises parent companyand Royale Caribbean Cruises introduced restrictions because of the outbreak, barring any passengers who have traveled to mainland China and Hong Kong in the last two weeks from sailing.  The restrictions are in place until at least the end of March, but Leung said the slump to her business will likely continue until the end of the year.  "Instead of targeting sailings in the second quarter or the third quarter, we probably need to sell the fourth quarter 2020 or beyond," Leung said.  Carnival said earlier this month that the coronavirus' impact on global bookings and canceled trips "will have a material impact" on the company's financial results.  Domestic Chinese travel will also suffer  The coronavirus outbreak hit during the critical Lunar New Year holiday, a time when millions across China travel home for family reunions. Beijing took the extraordinary step of extending the holiday until mid-February to try and contain the outbreak. Roughly half the country remains under travel restrictions.  All told, the coronavirus could result in 90 million fewer domestic trips and $115 billion in lost spending, according to the most severe scenario laid out by Tourism Economics.  The Temple of Heaven, a popular tourist destination in Beijing, is a ghost town.  InterContinental IHG has closed or partially closed 160 of its 470 hotels in greater China, a region that includes Taiwan and Hong Kong.  "We're seeing significant reductions in occupancy in the month of February across the entirety of the business," chief executive Keith Barr said during an earnings call earlier this month, adding that the disruption will cost the company about $5 million for February alone.  Airbnb is also feeling the effects. The short-term housing company said it has suspended all bookings in Beijing until May, in accordance with government guidance. Bookings in other areas, including Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been suspended until April.  Chinese airlines will also be hard hit.  China Southern ZNH Research firm Cirium found that more than 200,000 domestic flights in China were canceled between January 23 and February 18. The top three airlines most affected during that time were Chinese carriers Lucky Air,and Xiamen Airlines — each canceled nearly 50% of their flights.  Recovery could take years  So far, Trip.com's Sun said "millions of orders have been canceled," referring to both domestic and international trips. But she said the company is already seeing signs of pent-up demand.  After hunkering down for more than a month, "staying at home doing nothing, if we look at our search results, lots of people are ready to go out," she said.  Millions of Chinese may be itching to travel, but it'll be hard to make up for lost ground.  The World Tourism and Travel Council analyzed previous major viral epidemics, and found that the average recovery time for visitor numbers to a destination was 19 months.  Tourism Economics said Chinese travel demand will likely start to tick up later this year or by 2021.  But full recovery could take far longer. The research firm forecasts that China's outbound and domestic travel markets won't fully recover until about 2023.
2020-02-28	(CNN) If you show up at NYU Langone Health in New York City with a fever and a cough, they're going to assume you have the novel coronavirus.  "We don't care if you've traveled to us from China or from Queens, we're going to put a mask on you," said Dr. Michael Phillips , an infectious disease specialist at NYU.  The New York University doctors and other experts are convinced there could be more novel coronavirus cases in the United States than have been officially announced. The number of cases in the US increased to 89 as of Monday morning, up from 65 on Friday night  Several factors, such as testing delays and the fact that the virus can spread before an infected person shows any signs, have led them to this conclusion.  Recent US cases of coronavirus support that theory.  While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been focused on finding coronavirus among travelers from China and their close contacts, on Wednesday it announced the first US case with an unknown origin . The patient hadn't traveled to China and had no known exposure to someone with coronavirus. Since then, more cases of unknown origin have been identified in the United States  "That suggests that the virus is out there in the community, and that means pretty much that everybody's at risk," said Dr. Dean Blumberg , an infection disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center, where one of the California patients is being treated, told CNN affiliate KCRA. "We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we can get it from."  'An interesting and complicated problem'  Early on in the outbreak, Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Justin Lessler started to think along the same lines as the NYU doctors.  Lessler's team wondered: Could there have been cases of coronavirus in the US even before the first case in the country was announced on January 21?  They took a look at a calendar.  The first known case of coronavirus anywhere in the world occurred in Wuhan, China, on December 8. For the next six weeks, people flew out of Wuhan and surrounding cities, until China locked down the area on January 23.  Lessler's team set up a computer model to look at that time period and found that most likely about four people who were infected with coronavirus -- but possibly as many as 10 - traveled from Hubei province to California during this time. They looked at California because that's the state expected to bear the largest brunt of the outbreak.  Lessler calls these estimates "very rough" and emphasizes that this is just modeling.  But if their model is right, and even one infected traveler entered California unnoticed during this time, he or she might have spread the disease to others.  "It's an interesting and complicated problem," said Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Looking for coronavirus in the community  The CDC knows there could be cases of coronavirus they might have missed. That's why they've set up surveillance labs in five cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City -- to look for cases. These labs, which routinely check patient specimens for flu, will start checking for coronavirus in specimens that test negative for flu.  The surveillance plan was announced about two weeks ago, but it's unclear if it's started because there's been a delay in distributing lab kits. The CDC said Friday that more state and local labs were coming online for testing in the next few days.  While experts say the surveillance could show there's spread beyond the known cases, they also say they don't believe there have been large, undetected clusters of coronavirus without anyone noticing.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said it's "unlikely" that there are "entire cohorts" of coronavirus cases that no one's picked up on.  For example, he said someone unknowingly infected with coronavirus might have gotten off a flight from China and taken an Uber home. He said it's possible the Uber driver became infected and wasn't officially counted as a case, but he doubts that the driver started a large chain of transmission.  "We could have missed one or two cases, but not entire cohorts," Fauci said.  Ron Klain, who served as Ebola czar under President Obama, said the United States may not have found cases of coronavirus here "because we haven't looked."  "We haven't really tested extensively. We don't know how widespread it is. If you don't test, you're not going to find it," Klain told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. "I think what's clear is however many cases there are here now, there are going to be more."  Why coronavirus cases might go undetected  Experts say there are several reasons there could be unidentified cases of coronavirus in the US.  First is that early cases might have been missed, as demonstrated by the Johns Hopkins model.  Secondly, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms, or are just mildly ill. Even someone coming off a flight from coronavirus hotspots such as China, Italy or South Korea might attribute feeling slightly ill to something besides coronavirus.  "That's human nature," NYU's Phillips said. "They're going to think -- maybe it's the airplane food. I'm going to get better."  Thirdly, some people traveling into the US from these hotspots might intentionally deny feeling sick because they don't want to be isolated in a hospital for two weeks. If they're on a flight from China, and they know they'll be checked for fever when they land in the US, they could take Tylenol or Advil to mask the fever.  "Being a suspicious New Yorker, I'm like, 'Prove it to me that people aren't going to do that,' " Phillips said.  And finally, so far 12 people have traveled through US commercial airports and were later found to be infected with coronavirus. For a period of time, these travelers were symptom-free before they were diagnosed.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  It's known that someone can spread coronavirus even before they develop symptoms. But health authorities have not routinely traced back all the contacts a person had before they became ill, so it's possible that some of them were missed and spread the virus.  For all these reasons, experts say there could be cases that we're missing.  "Anyone would be foolish to say it's not possible," said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley.
2020-02-28	New York (CNN Business) Confidence is a fragile thing in financial markets. It can vanish in an instant. That's exactly what happened during this coronavirus-fueled mayhem on Wall Street.  It took the S&P 500 just six trading days to go from record highs to a correction. That's the fastest such swing in more than 70 years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.  "For the moment, panic is high," Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, wrote in a report to clients Thursday.  Wall Street is beginning to price in the risk that the coronavirus could spark a severe economic slowdown or even a recession in the United States. Smartphone sales are in freefall is warning of softer spending.is facing iPhone shortages andsays artificial sweetener is in short supply.  "The coronavirus is showing us the unpredictable path that an exogenous force can play in interrupting an economy that is already exhibiting many late-cycle symptoms," Minerd wrote.  Priced for perfection, markets blindsided by health crisis  The epic losses have been amplified by a few major factors.  One, markets were pricing in perfection, as evidenced by lofty market valuations. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio hit 18-year highs just last week.  In other words, Wall Street was complacent about the coronavirus outbreak and its consequences. Investors were blindsided when the health crisis spread from China to South Korea, Italy and other major economies.  Another problem is that investors are not trained in epidemics, let alone pandemics. That creates a fear of the unknown. In that environment, investors are selling first and asking questions later.  Meanwhile, markets may also rattled by the shifting political backdrop . Not only is Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, leading the race for the Democratic nomination, but Goldman Sachs has warned the coronavirus could cost President Donald Trump the election. That could mean a sharp pivot away from the Trump-era's low taxes and light regulation that markets love.  Wall Street is now bracing for weaker corporate profits ahead because of the coronavirus. Goldman Sachs warned that 2020 S&P 500 earnings growth could be wiped out by the damage done to supply chains and demand.  That suggests the selling may not be done just yet. RBC Capital Markets said the S&P 500 could tumble to a range of 2,700 points and 2,900 points, equaling a total loss of 14% to 20% from its record highs. The firm said that would be "consistent with the growth scares" of 2010, 2011, 2015-2016 and the second half of 2018.  'Historic extremes'  But market veterans are urging everyday investors not to panic -- and to put the losses into context.  Yes, the Dow suffered its worst point drop ever on Thursday. But on a percentage basis, the 4.4% drop pales in comparison with the 8% nosedives of 2008, let alone the 22% crash on Black Monday in 1987.  And despite this week's heavy losses, the S&P 500 has still more than quadrupled from the 2009 lows.  It's important to remember that markets tend to overreact, both to the upside and downside. And the silver lining of the ongoing market rout is that stocks have started to work off some of the froth that had built up. At a certain point, stocks will start to look attractive again.  "We are seeing historic extremes in selling pressure," said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory.  Citing the improved risk/reward backdrop, Lerner upgraded his outlook on stocks Thursday from "neutral" back to "attractive."  History shows that markets tend to overreact to recession scares.  The S&P 500 plunged 10% in just four trading sessions. One year after such a selloff, the S&P 500 has always been up, Lerner said. The average gain has been 26%.  Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS, told clients in a report Thursday that the "solid" economic fundamentals in the United States suggest the disruption from the coronavirus will be "short-lived."  "While we are not trying to call the bottom of the market," Haefele wrote, "past experience suggests this is a good time to invest in US stocks for investors with a time horizon of several months or more."
2020-02-28	(CNN) The US State Department on Friday raised its travel advisory for Italy to the second-highest-level warning, Level 3: Reconsider Travel, due to the novel coronavirus.  The move comes as Italy has suffered at least 650 cases and 17 deaths from the coronavirus , with the World Health Organization saying that the country, as well as Iran and South Korea, has reached a critical point in responding to the outbreak.  "Reconsider travel to Italy due to a recent outbreak of COVID-19," the advisory says. "There is an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel (new) coronavirus in Italy. Many cases of COVID-19 have been associated with travel to or from mainland China or close contact with a travel-related case, but sustained community spread has been reported in Italy."  Cases of the virus in Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have all been linked to travel to Italy . The country has already taken an economic hit from the epidemic, as stadiums and museums have been much quieter than usual in light of the virus.  The additional travel restrictions come amid the administration's concerns over the disease's continued spread.  Read More
2020-02-28	Seoul (CNN Business) South Korea is one of the world's most tech savvy countries. So when the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak reached the Korean peninsula, app developers there knew exactly how to react: They started coding.  Mobile apps that help track the disease in South Korea ranked as six of the top 15 downloads on the country's Google Play app store on Thursday. Developers of some apps — which source their data from public government information — told CNN Business that they have been getting a surge in downloads since launching their products earlier this month.  "The installs are increasing about 20,000 every hour," said Bae Won-Seok, one of the developers of Corona 100m, an app that allows people to see the date that a coronavirus patient was confirmed to have the disease, along with that patient's nationality, gender, age and where the patient visited. The person using the app can also see how close they are to coronavirus patients.  The app has been installed more than 1 million times since it was launched February 11, according to Google Play. Bae said that a recent surge in downloads, sparked by the escalating number of cases in the country, crashed the application's server.  Corona 100m, a coronavirus app available in South Korea.  Lee Jun-young, the developer of Corona Map, said he made his app because he found the government data hard to understand. Although health officials release locations that show where coronavirus patients have been, the official information isn't very visual.  Read More
2020-02-28	New York (CNN Business) Central banks around the world are closely monitoring the novel coronavirus outbreak, and investors believe they will step in to keep the world's economies humming.  That helped sent market expectations for interest rate cuts through the roof. The CME's FedWatch Tool shows a 100% chance that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates in March. The markets priced in an 11% chance of that a week ago.  The probability of a standard quarter-percentage-point cut on Friday was overtaken by expectations for a half-point cut at the Fed's next monetary policy meeting on March 18. The probability of the latter was 52% at Friday's close, down from nearly 92% earlier in the day.  The likelihood of a bigger rate cut shot through the roof later in the day, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tried to counter the market's expectations with a statement: "The fundamentals of the US economy remain strong," Powell said  He added that the central bank was monitoring the outbreak and its economic implications, and will "act as appropriate to support the economy."  Even though the meeting date is less than three weeks away, the central bank could meet earlier for an emergency rate cut, said analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The last emergency rate cut took place in 2008.  BofA also expects a half-percentage-point cut, citing disorderly market moves and a possible demand shock as a result of the virus outbreak. It said last year's "insurance" rate cuts could serve as a blueprint.  But the Federal Reserve might not be as quick to jump on the monetary easing wagon as investors would like.  Neel Kashkari and Loretta Mester, presidents of the Minneapolis and Cleveland central banks, respectively, both said Monday there was no immediate need to cut interest rates. James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Fed, said the central bank probably wouldn't cut rates unless the outbreak escalates.  "Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time," he said at the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce on Friday.  Apple AAPL Microsoft MSFT After all, the economic consequences of the virus outbreak have yet to be reflected in the US economic data that the Fed watches so closely. Large multinational companies likeandhave warned about how the outbreak will hurt on their businesses , but America's economy as a whole isn't all that reliant on trade and exports, which shields it somewhat from global economic woes. That means the Fed might not have reason to act yet.  Even though Fed cut rates three times last year to stimulate the economy, it is still above the ultra-low rates from the financial crisis. The benchmark rate now sits at 1.5% to 1.75%.  "The Fed is probably the central bank with the most room to cut, so it's almost rational to price in more action," said Ilan Solot, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, of the heightened expectations for lower rates.  Last year's cuts came on the coattails of the US-China trade war, which weighed on investor and business sentiment.  "The coronavirus has taken the baton from the trade war," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, adding that the virus outbreak is affecting similar assets and industries as last year's trade war did.  Are rates already too low?  But some investors are skeptical if monetary policy is the right tool to help combat the fallout from the outbreak.  "There is nothing that will be 'stimulated' monetarily from a rate cut or two that isn't already being 'stimulated' by the very low rate environment," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. "And rate cuts aren't a vaccine and won't bring factories back and people traveling again."  Similarly, the European Central Bank might not be the right authority to step in to stimulate the export-reliant European economy. The ECB still has not raised its benchmark interest rate since slashing it during the 2010-2012 European sovereign debt crisis . While the bank might cut other interest rates, already-low rates could mean European countries will combat any economic fallout from the virus outbreak with fiscal rather than monetary stimulus, said Marc-Andre Fongern, head of FX research at Fongern Global FX.  US Treasury yields, which are an expression of future interest rate expectations, have been sliding this week, with the 10-year government bond yield falling below 1.29% to a fresh record low. Bond yields and prices move opposite directions.  "In my opinion in the US, there's a conflation between hedging and the actual pricing in" of interest rate cuts, Solot said.  Fixed-income products like Treasuries are a common hedge for stock investors. Given the sharp selloff in stocks, the rally in bonds and consequently lower yields might be driven by more than just rates expectations.  In the developing world, the picture looks slightly different.  China, where the outbreak originated, is expected to feel the most economic pain as businesses and factories shut down. Its central bank has already stepped in to support the country's markets and economy.  Other countries in the region are following suit. The Bank of Indonesia cut its short-term lending rate by a quarter percentage point last week. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said earlier this month that "there is sufficient room" to ease its effective exchange rate to combat weakening economic conditions.
2020-02-28	Hakone, Japan (CNN) A plan is in the works to evacuate quarantined foreign diplomats from North Korea, a source inside the country has revealed, as concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus grow.  North Korea has not confirmed a single case of the virus inside its borders, but global health experts have warned the country is highly susceptible to an outbreak given its close proximity to China and limited medical capabilities. Every other country in East Asia has confirmed numerous cases.  The German Embassy, French Cooperation Office, and Swiss Development Cooperation will close operations in the capital Pyongyang completely, said the source, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, given the extreme sensitivity of the current situation.  Other countries with diplomatic missions in North Korea plan to scale down operations, the source added. "I would expect around 60 people to be on the flight," the source said.  An official from the Mangyongdae District emergency anti-epidemic headquarters disinfects a tramcar to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, at the Songsan Tram Station in Pyongyang on February 26, 2020.  The date of the evacuation flight has not been confirmed, but the source said it will likely fly from Pyongyang to the Russian city of Vladivostok, in the far east of the country.  Read More
2020-02-29	(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that while most Americans face a low risk from coronavirus, more US deaths could be imminent following the nation's first confirmed fatality.  "We know there will be more cases," Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper in a clip released Saturday, echoing President Donald Trump's earlier comments that additional cases in America were "likely." The full interview between Pence and Tapper is airing on Sunday's "State of the Union."  When asked whether more Americans could die from the disease, Pence, who Trump has put in charge of coronavirus response and messaging , replied, "It is possible."  Pence said that the situation explained to him by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and others is that "most people that contract the coronavirus, they will recover. They will deal with a respiratory illness, we'll get them treatment."  The vice president cautioned that the US could experience "more sad news."  Read More
2020-02-29	A fourth case of novel coronavirus was reported in Santa Clara County, California, according to the county's Public Health Department.  The case involves an adult woman who was in contact with another coronavirus patient in the county, the department said in statement on Saturday. She is not ill or hospitalized and is isolated at home, the statement said.  More on this: This means there are 70 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the United States. A presumptive positive case has tested positive by a public health lab and is pending confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  These include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and three people repatriated from China, according to the CDC.  With the new Santa Clara County case, there are 23 US cases in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin. Thirteen of these cases are travel-related and 10 are linked to person-to-person spread. Cases are cumulative from January 21.
2020-02-29	Washington (CNN) In a striking contradiction to White House assertions that the coronavirus is under control, the Pentagon's chief of personnel is sharply warning that the virus poses an increased "threat" in areas where US troops and defense personnel are located around the globe.  In a February 25 memo, Matthew Donovan, who is filling the top personnel job on a temporary basis, informed the military's most senior leaders that as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, it is "an increasing force health protection (FHP) threat in areas where Department of Defense (DoD) personnel live and work."  CNN has learned that top US commanders around the globe are increasingly concerned that as allies shut down borders and travel in response to the virus' spread, there's a risk that by the end of March, US military readiness may start degrading, according to several defense officials.  The military leaders' concerns and Donovan's memo are the latest signs that the virus is becoming a national security challenge. It is affecting the military, curtailing diplomats' movements, straining global supply chains and shaking the US economy, which saw stock markets drop more in the past week than they have since the economic crisis of 2008.  Rapid response  A key joint military training exercise has been canceled in South Korea, while the Pentagon is sending additional medical and lab personnel, doctors and nurses to support US forces on the peninsula.  Navy ships that have stopped at Pacific ports recently have been ordered to stay out at sea for two weeks in a self-quarantine to allow time to observe whether any sailors have picked up the virus. A US service member in South Korea has tested positive for coronavirus, and US Forces Korea confirmed the service member's spouse has also tested positive. Four total US Forces Korea-related individuals have been confirmed to have the virus.  At US Army installations in Vicenza, Italy, commanders have restricted access to public areas such as church, gyms and childcare centers and ordered extra Meals Ready to Eat in case they have to quarantine.  In the Middle East, United States Central Command, which overseas operations and bases there, has canceled all liberty and leave.  With coronavirus now present in 55 countries, infecting almost 84,000 and killing nearly 3,000, the Trump administration's fitful, uncoordinated response is raising questions, particularly among public health and security experts who note that just last year, the intelligence community and the White House flagged the need to prepare for the disruptive risk of a major disease outbreak.  "If you go and look at the National Biodefense Strategy, the National Security Strategy or the new National Defense Strategy, any one of those documents point to this and acknowledge that these outbreaks have the potential, if not managed properly, to be destabilizing," said J. Steven Morrison, who directs the global health policy center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  "They can overwhelm society, overwhelm health systems, have crippling economic consequences and stability issues, they can obviously strike at [military] readiness, trigger mass migration," Morrison said.  The national security risk of a disease outbreak is highlighted on page eight of the Trump administration's National Security Strategy . The intelligence community's Worldwide Threat Assessment , issued January 2019, said that the US and the world "will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or largescale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, ... increase calls on the United States for support" and destabilize fragile states.  Other intelligence assessments note that "the relationship between disease and political instability is indirect but real," and that US military forces deployed in support of humanitarian and peacekeeping operations in developing countries are at highest risk.  Greg Treverton -- a former chair of the US National Intelligence Council, an office within the US intelligence community -- said that during one exercise a decade ago to evaluate the level of various threats, including terrorism, the only one that ranked as "existential" was a pandemic. "The national security implications are potentially very big," said Treverton, a founder of Global TechnoPolitics Forum conference, which partners with the GeoTech Center from the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank.  "It has already wreaked havoc with markets and supply chains -- that has national security implications because the economy is critical," Treverton said.  Disruptions to US military and diplomats -- America's eyes and ears overseas -- are already clear.  The State Department has been raising restrictions on US government employees in China since late January and has ordered the departure of all family members under the age of 21. In February, the department allowed for the voluntary departure of US government employees and their families from Hong Kong.  One administration source tells CNN there are currently discussions about ordering the departure of some US diplomats and their families in South Korea and Japan, but no final decision has been made.  In Asia, two US diplomats tell CNN they haven't been told about those very early stage talks, but are on edge, waiting to see not only how the virus spreads, but how their host countries and Washington respond. There is concern about the economic impact on US businesses if the White House moves to restrict travel from Japan or South Korea to the US, the diplomats tell CNN.  Government messaging both to employees and the broader public is an essential part of a national security response, said Nada Bakos, a national security expert and former CIA analyst.  "A pandemic can induce fear-based individual behavioral changes, similar to reactions to terrorist attacks and not all behavior changes are productive," Bakos told CNN, adding that clear, transparent communication about risks and prevention can "make a big difference in how accurately a threat is perceived."  "The public can't adequately prepare without clear guidance and confidence in their government," Bakos said. "Without clear communication, political stability is stressed and the situation can spark violence between authorities and citizens. Failure to utilize national security frameworks to address a pandemic may have severe human and economic costs."  Treverton said that while he thinks "the administration has done OK," President Donald Trump "by being so Pollyannaish about it, I think he hasn't prepared people for what might come."  'This is moving pretty quickly'  Defense Secretary Mark Esper told the House Armed Services committee Wednesday that US Northern Command has been put in charge of synchronizing the department's Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease plans, coordinating with other commands to assess potential impacts.  Esper also said that he has not yet held talks about whether the Defense Department will need additional funding from Congress to meet the coronavirus threat, saying he would have to discuss that with the combatant commanders first.  "This is moving pretty quickly," he told lawmakers.  Already, US military planners are quietly trying to figure out if the regular rotations of tens of thousands of personnel can take place this spring and summer, a routine occurrence that could be complicated as countries begin to shut down their borders.  Thousands of personnel worldwide usually change assignments mid-year, often as soon as the school year ends. If they and their families cannot readily travel overseas to new jobs, and troops currently overseas cannot rotate, this could lead to further turmoil and uncertainty in the military personnel system officials say.  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley assured the House committee that the department is "taking all the appropriate measures right now," adding that estimates of the situation were underway. "We owe you some answers," Milley said.  Not waiting  But field commanders are not waiting to request supplies or take action.  Approximately 70 additional US military medical personnel -- doctors, nurses and medical technicians -- will now deploy to US installations in South Korea, one official said. They will provide clinical care and laboratory support, but their main mission will be to help test military, dependents and contractor personnel for the coronavirus once test kits arrive from the CDC.  Several officials say it still is not clear when those kits will arrive even though the outbreak in South Korea has grown in recent days.  Liberty -- the ability of troops to leave their bases -- is being heavily restricted in the Persian Gulf region by US Central Command. Steps by host countries in the Middle East are also affecting US troops.  With the land border heavily restricted between Iraq and Kuwait, all resupply of forces in Iraq will now be done by air.  And more than 60 US personnel who traveled to Israel for an exercise to train against regional threats such as Iran began returning to their bases in Europe on Friday at the request of the Israeli government, although none of them were reported to be ill.  The head of US European Command, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, told the Senate Tuesday that they are carefully monitoring the infection's impact and anticipate an increase of coronavirus cases in Germany that could lead to restricted troop movement. The lockdowns in Vicenza could be extended as well, he said.  Major exercise under threat  In addition, the virus could affect the Pentagon's decision to proceed with a lengthy upcoming exercise, involving as many as 20,000 troops training against a Russian threat.  Privately, defense officials say that as these long-planned US military exercises are postponed or canceled, troops will be less up to date on critical training for future operations. Publicly, Pentagon officials are not discussing details of how training and operations could be impacted.  A specially commissioned National Intelligence Estimate in 2000 identified exactly this kind of fallout. Possibly the first to look at the threat posed by infectious outbreaks, it predicted that, "these diseases will endanger US citizens at home and abroad, threaten US armed forces deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and regions in which the United States has significant interests."  Morrison told CNN that for the past few decades, national security professionals have recognized that the dangers of infectious diseases have been growing, a dynamic, the intelligence community's 2019 threat assessment also noted.  That report said tenuous improvements to global health security -- which the administration has moved to defund -- "may be inadequate to address the challenge of what we anticipate will be more frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases because of rapid unplanned urbanization, prolonged humanitarian crises, human incursion into previously unsettled land, expansion of international travel and trade, and regional climate change."  Morrison pointed to health scares such as SARS, Ebola, swine flu and Zika that have erupted in the last few years.  "The more that the global economy gets interconnected, the higher those consequences become," Morrison said. "We can predict to some degree we're going to see these [events happen] with greater frequency, higher velocity and come with a higher human and economic impact."
2020-02-29	Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Saturday announced new travel restrictions after confirmation of the first coronavirus death in the US, with President Donald Trump signaling a more robust response as US cases rise.  Trump said additional cases in America were "likely" but cautioned the public not to "panic."  "Additional cases in the US are likely," Trump said, "but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover."  The President, joined by members of his administration's coronavirus task force as he made comments from the White House briefing room, aimed to calm Americans.  "We respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all," Trump said.  The President also offered his condolences to the first coronavirus death in America.  Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington, confirmed Saturday that the individual who died was male. Trump earlier described the patient, who died in Washington state, as a "medically high-risk patient in her late 50s" and "a wonderful woman."  A senior administration official blamed the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the mix up.  "Dr. (Robert) Redfield briefed Pence and Trump after speaking with Washington State health officials that it was a woman. Washington State has since corrected," the official said.  Redfield tweeted later Saturday that the "CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female in a briefing earlier (Saturday) with the President and Vice President."  The Washington patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Redfield, who spoke alongside the President at Saturday's briefing.  Travel and coronavirus  Pence said at the briefing that the US would be expanding travel restrictions from Iran "to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days." He also said the US would heighten a travel advisory for specific regions of Italy and South Korea.  "We are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus," Pence said.  Pence also emphasized that "the average American does not need to go out and buy a mask," and that at least 35 million more masks per month are expected to be produced for the United States.  More courses of action to increase the availability of masks to high-risk health care workers will be announced later Saturday, Pence said.  Trump also said he'll be meeting with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss developing a coronavirus vaccine.  The President's update followed a briefing from his coronavirus task force earlier in the day, which Trump said lasted for more than two and a half hours.  The President said there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.  There are four instances of possible community spread transmission of coronavirus -- two in California, one in Oregon and one in Washington.  "The markets will all come back," Trump said. "We have one problem -- we have to get this problem brought into focus."  "It's certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel that's a big part of market. But for a period of time we're going to have to do what's necessary. Safety, health -- number one. The markets will take care of themselves," he continued.  The President suggested the Federal Reserve should take measures to assist with the economic dip that has resulted from the coronavirus outbreak. He also brought up his long-anticipated middle-income tax cuts.  The President has previously appeared to downplay the effects of coronavirus, saying earlier this week that he did not think community spread of the infections disease in the country was "inevitable," despite that fact that CDC officials have been assessing that they expect to see community spread within the country.  Trump has rarely delivered remarks to the press from the White House briefing room, but his Saturday appearance marks his second time in the room in less than a week.  The President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now "politicizing" the virus. "Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus," Trump said. "They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa."  "This is their new hoax," Trump added.  On Saturday, Trump said he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a "hoax," but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't.  "Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody," the President explained. "I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing."  Trump called it the "continuation of the hoax," and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment.  "I don't like it when they are criticizing these people, and I don't like it," he said. "That's the hoax I'm talking about."  Worldwide, the virus has killed at least 2,922 -- including 2,835 people in China -- and there have been 85,055 confirmed cases.  A senior administration official told CNN on Friday that Trump's mid-March meeting with leaders of southeast Asian countries in Las Vegas had been postponed.  This story has been updated to reflect that the individual who died in the first reported coronavirus death in the US was male.
2020-02-29	Coronavirus is hitting South Korea hard, especially the city of Daegu. Many of the city's cases are linked to the Shincheonji religious group which the mayor accuses of withholding information on members. CNN's Ivan Watson reports.
2020-02-29	(CNN) A patient infected with the novel coronavirus in Washington state has died, a state health official said Saturday, marking the first death due to the virus in the United States.  The patient was a man in his 50s who had underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington. County health officials became aware of the case on Friday, he said.  "I want to assure that family they are on the hearts of every American," Vice President Mike Pence said in a press briefing Saturday.  There was no evidence the patient had close contact with an infected person or a relevant travel history that would have exposed the patient to the virus, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at the White House Saturday, suggesting the patient became ill through community spread.  While this is the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, it is not the first death of an American. A 60-year-old US citizen died earlier this month in the city of Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared in late December.  President Donald Trump and US officials previously said in a press briefing that the patient was a woman. A senior administration official later blamed the mix up on Redfield , who tweeted later Saturday that the "CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female" during a briefing with Trump and Pence.  US officials urged Americans not to panic.  "We respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all," Trump said.  "It's important to remember," Azar said, "for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms, and their treatment will be to remain at home, treating their symptoms, the way they would a severe cold, or the flu."  The US is expanding travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus, Pence said.  The administration is expanding existing travel restrictions on Iran to include foreign nationals who had visited Iran in the last 14 days, the Vice President said. The US will increase travel advisories for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 — the highest level — advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries.  Officials investigating Washington nursing facility  Three new presumptive positive cases were announced in Washington state on Saturday, meaning a test given by a state or local lab came back positive, but has yet to be confirmed by the CDC's lab in Atlanta.  Among those three cases was the patient who died, health officials said.  The other cases are both affiliated with Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, Duchin said. One case is a health care worker, a woman in her 40s, who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition. She had no relevant history of travel.  The other case is a woman in her 70s who was a resident of the center. She is in serious condition in another hospital.  State health officials are aware of a "number of individuals who are ill" with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia, at the facility, Duchin said, and officials are investigating this as an outbreak.  More than 50 residents and staff from the facility will be tested, Duchin said.  Life Care Center of Kirkland is monitoring its residents and associates, executive director Ellie Basham said in a statement.  "We take the event very seriously and have members of our corporate clinical team en route to provide extra assistance," Basham said. The facility is in contact with state health officials and the CDC.  A woman who said her elderly father lives at the facility told CNN that the center's staff called her Saturday, asked her not to visit at this time and said her father was being tested for coronavirus.  The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was informed earlier in the week that her father had a cough. She was told Saturday that he was still doing OK.  "If he was worsening, they would let me know," she said. "They've always been great about that. If anything is wrong, they call me."  The woman and her father have always been happy with his treatment at the facility, she said.  Now her concern is whether her father has the coronavirus. After hearing multiple people at the facility exhibit troubling symptoms, she wondered if all will be diagnosed with the same thing.  "So then what happens?" she said. "Does everybody just kind of stay there, and the whole place becomes its own quarantine thing? I don't know."  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a state of emergency after the increase in cases. The proclamation directed state agencies to use "all resources necessary to prepare for and response to the outbreak."  Multiple cases without a relevant travel history  There are now at least 71 confirmed or presumptive positive coronavirus cases in the United States, the CDC said Saturday.  These include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 24 cases that occurred in the US, according to the CDC. The 24 cases across the US are in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin.  Of those 24, 13 cases are travel-related, and 10 are linked to person-to-person spread, according to the CDC.  The person-to-person cases include several of unknown origin, including:  • A woman in Washington County, Oregon, who is presumptive positive. She is in isolation.  • A high school boy in Snohomish County, Washington, who is presumptive positive. He's doing well, according to Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District.  • An older woman in Santa Clara County, California, who tested positive.  • A Solano County, California, woman who is in serious condition at UC Davis Medical Center.  Another Santa Clara County case was confirmed Saturday, according to the county's Public Health Department. This patient, the fourth in the county, was described as an adult woman and a "household contact" of the older woman.  A patient in Illinois was diagnosed with coronavirus, according to a joint press release from the Illinois and Cook County health departments. The test results conducted on this patient in Illinois produced a presumptive positive for COVID-19, the release said, which means the results have to be confirmed by the CDC.  The presumptive positive patient is hospitalized in isolation, the release said. Illinois has already had two previously confirmed cases of coronavirus and both patients made a full recovery, the release said.  American Airlines announced Saturday they were suspending flights from Miami and New York to Milan, Italy, effective March 1, according to a travel advisory from the airline . Flights to Milan will resume April 25. Customers who have had their flights canceled and do not want to rebook can request a full refund through the American Airlines website.  Officials work to expand testing capabilities  Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County, said new cases could have been identified earlier if not for the delays in local testing capability and restrictive criteria about who gets tested.  The patient who died was identified after the state lab acquired the coronavirus test kit. The patient was newly eligible for testing because of "very recent criteria that were put out by the Centers for Disease Control that our health care providers became aware of," Duchin said.  Testing guidelines were broadened by the CDC earlier this week after the first case of unknown origin emerged in California. She wasn't initially tested because she did not fit the CDC criteria for testing at the time.  Additionally, some testing kits initially sent to state and local labs were flawed, delaying their ability to test for the virus.  "This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday.  The CDC hopes to have every state and local health department testing for the coronavirus by the end of next week, Messonnier said in a press briefing Friday.  In hopes of enabling more rapid testing capabilities, the US Food and Drug Administration announced Saturday it would allow certain labs to use tests they developed and validated before the FDA has reviewed them.  The guidance only applies to labs that are certified to perform high-complexity testing. Once labs have validated a test, the guidance says, they must notify the FDA and submit a request for emergency use authorization within 15 business days.  Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's name.
2020-03-01	A total of five new presumptive positive cases of coronavirus were identified in California Sunday, according to health departments in three counties.  Two patients are health care workers from Alameda County and Solano County, according to a joint press release from two localities. Both are employees at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, according to the release. Vacaville is about 34 miles southwest of Sacramento.  The two patients came into contact with a community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the release said. The patients are currently in isolation at home.  These cases are pending confirmatory testing from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the release said.  The three other cases were identified in Santa Clara County, according to the county's health department. The total number of cases in the county is now seven, the release said.  One of the cases in Santa Clara is a woman with chronic health issues who is hospitalized, the release said. Officials have not said how this person contracted the virus.  The other two cases are a husband and wife, the release said. Both are hospitalized and the husband has chronic health conditions. Both recently traveled to Egypt, the release said.
2020-03-01	(CNN) A second person has died in Washington state and five more people have tested positive with the novel coronavirus, health officials said Sunday.  Four of the new cases, including the second death, are among residents of a long-term nursing facility where officials have been investigating a possible outbreak of coronavirus.  The second death was a man in his 70s who died Saturday, Seattle & King County Public Health said in a release.  A fifth case was reported in Snohomish County, the county's health department said in a release. The five new cases are presumptive, meaning they have been tested positive by a public health lab and are pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In all, 13 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the state, including a man whose death was reported Saturday , making him the first coronavirus fatality in the United States.  Dr. Jeff Duchin, a health officer with King County, addresses a news conference on Saturday, February 29, 2020, in Seattle.  The 13th case reported late Sunday is a man in his 40s. He is in critical condition, the health department said.  The other three new cases reported Sunday are a woman in her 80s, a woman in her 90s and a man in his 70s. All have underlying health conditions and are in critical condition.  Two other cases were confirmed by Seattle and King County Public Health officials earlier Sunday. They are both males in their 60s with underlying health conditions. One is "in critical but stable condition" at Valley Medical Center in Renton. The other is in critical condition at Virginia Mason Medical Center, a news release said.  "This number is expected to rise as more people are tested and results confirmed," according to a news release from the health department.  However, the two new coronavirus cases are not linked to the long-term health facility where the other coronavirus cases were identified, Katie Ross, a spokeswoman for Washington Health Department, told CNN.  The other cases are a high school boy, a woman who traveled to South Korea and an unidentified man.  Nursing home case  The cases associated with the Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, include a 40-year-old female health care worker who has no known travel outside the US. She is in satisfactory condition at a local hospital, officials said. The second one, a woman in her 70s, is hospitalized in serious condition.  More than 50 residents and staff from the Life Care Center in Kirkland are experiencing symptoms, and will be tested for coronavirus, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County.  "In addition, we're aware of a number of individuals associated with the long-term care facility who are reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia, and we're in the process of investigating this situation as an outbreak," Duchin said. "We're in the beginning stages of our investigation."  In a statement, the facility said it's not allowing visits from families, volunteers or vendors, and is also placing admissions on hold for the time being.  "We are now in the process of working with the long-term care facility, with the support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention," Duchin said. "And we're in a process of providing support to that facility to care for the infected patients, to protect the uninfected patients, and to provide infection control."  Bonnie Holstad's husband, Ken, is a resident at Life Care Center of Kirkland.  Bonnie Holstad, whose husband Ken is staying at the Life Care Center after a fall caused a broken hip, was outside the facility Sunday, trying to get information about her husband's condition. Her husband, who has Parkinson's disease and dementia, had a cough, and the center was not answering phone calls, Holstad said.  So, she made a sign and stood outside the glass front doors of the facility. "No one at Life Care is answering the phones," the sign read. "He needs to be attended to ... what is his temperature?"  A nurse did go down to check on him, she told CNN, and Holstad was told he doesn't have a fever. He's not being tested for the virus, she said, because he doesn't have all symptoms required for testing.  "I was so angry. How can this be that I have to do this, make a sign and go down there?" Holstad said.  "I'm very worried for my husband," Holstad said. "He's one of the vulnerable people," because of his age and his Parkinson's disease.  "I have real problems with how they're handling the interface with family," she said, remarking it was "sort of like a movie about an epidemic in a little town, and they don't know how to handle the situation."  CNN emailed the Life Care Center on Sunday about Holstad's husband but did not receive a response.  Holstad said when she was there Wednesday, she noticed staff members wearing masks. She was told that was because some residents had colds. On Saturday, when she arrived with sandwiches to have lunch with her husband, there was a sign on the door that visitors weren't allowed. It wasn't until she got home and listened to a voicemail from the center that she knew about the coronavirus there.  It's not just the question of his care, Holstad said, but also the fact that family members aren't given any information on what they should be doing after being in contact with the center's residents. Nine family members had visited her husband this week, she said.  High school boy had flu-like symptoms  The high school boy in Snohomish County became ill with flu-like symptoms last Monday, the student's family said in a statement.  He was tested for the flu, but the tests came back negative, so he returned to Jackson High School on Friday, the county health district said in a blog post.  He stayed on campus about five minutes and went home because the family was notified by health officials that his original sample had been tested for coronavirus and came back presumptive positive, the health district said.  "The family didn't know their son was being tested for COVID-19.... Like most people, they assumed it was the flu. They did all the right things," the health district said.  A staff member blocks the view as a person is taken by a stretcher to a waiting ambulance from a nursing facility where dozens of people are being tested for coronavirus.  The high school was closed over the weekend and will be closed Monday to allow for a thorough cleaning and disinfecting before the students return.  District health officials say they are investigating this case since it suggests that local transmission of COVID-19 is occurring.  "Our team is still in the midst of the investigation, so we do not yet know the possible source of infection," said Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer for the Snohomish Health District.  The Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, where several residents and staff will be tested for the novel coronavirus.  Hazen High School in the Seattle suburb of Renton will be closed Monday after a student and parent reported having flu-like symptoms, the school district's superintendent, Damien Pattenaude said in a Facebook post Sunday.  The student hasn't been to school since falling sick Wednesday. Along with the parent, who works in the health care industry, the student is self-quarantined at home.  Both have been tested the virus and are awaiting the results. Custodial staff have been mobilized "to begin thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting Hazen," the post said.  State of emergency in Washington state  Elsewhere, the Lake Washington Institute of Technology will be closed Monday and Tuesday after a nursing faculty member and 16 nursing students were at the Life Care Center late last week, said Dr. Amy Morrison, the institute's president. It's also canceling all large community and college events this week, Morrison said in a statement.  In nearby Redmond, seven medics are being quarantined after possible exposure to the virus and "out of an abundance of caution," the Redmond Police Department tweeted Sunday, without giving details on the possible exposure.  In Kirkland, 25 firefighters and two police officers that responded to calls at the facility have been placed under quarantine out of an abundance of caution, according to a statement on the city of Kirkland's website.  "The first responders under quarantine had responded to calls for various medical complaints at the Life Care Center, one of which resulted in a patient being transferred to Evergreen Hospital," the statement says. "Firefighters are either under home quarantine or are utilizing a Kirkland fire station for quarantine."  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency Saturday, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to respond to the outbreak.  "This will allow us to get the resources we need," Inslee said. "This is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state."  There are now at least 85 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in the United States and two deaths. They include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 38 cases that occurred in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
2020-03-01	(CNN) Italy reported a 50% increase in coronavirus cases Sunday, as the US further restricted travel and the famed La Scala opera house closed.  Italy's Civil Protection Authority reported the country now has 1,694 confirmed coronavirus cases, up from 1,128 confirmed cases on Saturday. Thirty-four people have died.  Italy has the most coronavirus cases of any country outside of Asia.  Delta Air Lines is suspending its US flights to Milan, the carrier announced Sunday. The last flight out will be depart New York on Monday. The last return flight will be on Tuesday.  Delta said it will resume flights to Milan on May 1. Rome flights are not affected.  Read More
2020-03-01	(CNN) The first novel coronavirus cases were reported in Florida and New York on Sunday while officials in Washington state confirmed the second US death from the outbreak.  The New York patient is a woman in her late 30s, who contracted the virus while traveling in Iran and is currently isolated in her home, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.  We have learned of the 1st positive case of COVID-19 in NY. The patient contracted the virus while in Iran & is isolated There is no reason for undue anxiety—the general risk remains low in NY. We are diligently managing this situation &will provide info as it becomes available. pic.twitter.com/rLnObvrg3R  "The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York," Cuomo's statement read.  The New York State Department of Health said the patient went to a hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus.  Cuomo said approval for state testing was granted Saturday and the positive test was confirmed by New York's Wadsworth Lab in Albany.  "There is no cause for surprise -- this was expected," Cuomo said. "As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York."  Disease detectives in New York have already identified close contacts of the patient, according to New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot.  "As we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic," Barbot said.  Coronavirus cases continue to rise in US  Officials in King County, Washington, confirmed the second US coronavirus death was a male patient in his 70s with underlying health conditions. He was hospitalized at Evergreen Health in Kirkland and died Saturday, according to a King County Public Health news release.  Vice President Mike Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that more US deaths were "possible."  "We could have more sad news," he said. "But the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low."  The New York case was one of several reported Sunday. Two new presumptive positive cases were identified in Florida, according to a press release from the Florida Department of Health. These are the first cases in the state of Florida.  Seven more cases were reported in Washington state, bringing the total to 13 cases. Three have been reported in Snohomish County and 10 have been reported in King County, including two deaths.  But those were just the latest developments in Washington state, where officials Saturday announced the first coronavirus death in the US and where authorities were investigating a nursing facility outside Seattle.  Of the 88,443 cases confirmed globally, at least 3,041 have been fatal -- 2,912 of which were in China. The US has at least 89 confirmed cases of the virus, according to counts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health authorities.  People wear protective masks to fend off the coronavirus, while street vendors peddlel hand sanitizer and other disinfecting products in Queens, New York.  Officials investigate Washington nursing facility  Among the US cases are several believed to have been spread person-to-person with unknown origins, including the patient in Washington state who died, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC.  The patient was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington.  Officials announced two cases linked to Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, including a 40-year-old health care worker and a woman in her 70s. The health care worker is in satisfactory condition at a local hospital, and the woman in her 70s is hospitalized in serious condition.  JUST WATCHED Epidemiologist: This is just the tip of the iceberg Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Epidemiologist: This is just the tip of the iceberg 02:18  But more than 50 residents and staff at the facility are experiencing symptoms and will be tested for coronavirus, Duchin told reporters Saturday. Four new presumptive positive cases were detected Sunday, all of whom were residents of the Life Care Center, according to a press release from Seattle and King County Public Health. .  "We're in the process of investigating this situation as an outbreak," he said.  "We take the event very seriously," a statement from the facility's executive director said, in part. Life Care Center is not allowing visits from families, volunteers or vendors, and admissions have been placed on hold for the time being, the statement said.  But residents and staff weren't the only ones impacted.  At least 25 firefighters and two police officers who responded to the Life Care Center have now been placed under quarantine "out of an abundance of caution," according to a statement from the City of Kirkland. Firefighters are either under quarantine at home or at a Kirkland fire station, the statement said.  There were also concerns that 16 nursing students and a faculty member from Lake Washington Institute of Technology were exposed to the virus after visiting the center late last week, the school said in a statement. The campus will be closed Monday and Tuesday to be cleaned and disinfected.  Five more cases identified in California  A total of five new presumptive positive cases of coronavirus were identified in California Sunday, according to health departments in three counties.  Two patients are health care workers from Alameda County and Solano County, according to a joint press release from two localities. Both are employees at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, according to the release. Vacaville is about 34 miles southwest of Sacramento.  The two patients came into contact with a community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the release said. The patients are currently in isolation at home.  These cases are pending confirmatory testing from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the release said.  The three other cases were identified in Santa Clara County, according to the county's health department. The total number of cases in the county is now seven, the release said.  One of the cases in Santa Clara is a woman with chronic health issues who is hospitalized, the release said. Officials have not said how this person contracted the virus.  The other two cases are a husband and wife, the release said. Both are hospitalized and the husband has chronic health conditions. Both recently traveled to Egypt, the release said.  The Rhode Island Department of Health announced the state's first presumptive positive case on Sunday morning. The patient was said to be in their 40s and had in mid-February traveled in Europe, including Italy, where there were 1,694 cases as of Sunday.  The Rhode Island patient is being treated at an undisclosed hospital, and officials are reaching out to people who have had direct contact with the individual, the state Department of Health said in a statement. The patient has had limited travel within the state and hasn't been to work since returning from Italy.  Rhode Island reported a second case later on Sunday, a teenage girl with mild symptoms.  A second case was also reported in Oregon on Sunday. The Washington County adult had close household contact with the state's initial case and did not require medical attention, the Oregon Health Authority said in a news release.  Among the US cases are 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people who were repatriated from China and 42 cases that were detected in the US.  At least 19 cases in the US are travel-related and at least 19 are linked to person-to-person spread, according to the CDC. Four are of unknown origin  But New York University doctors and other experts say the US probably has more cases than identified officially. That's because of testing delays and the virus' ability to spread before an infected person shows any symptoms.  The New York Times reported Sunday the virus might have been in Washington state for weeks and up to 1,500 people might be infected there.  US expands travel restrictions  The vice president said Saturday the administration is expanding existing travel restrictions on Iran to include foreign nationals who had visited Iran in the last 14 days.  The US will also increase travel advisories for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level -- advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries.  On Sunday, President Trump announced via Twitter new screening procedures for people arriving in the US if they are traveling from "high-risk countries."  Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Pence, clarified to CNN what is covered under the screening measures Trump mentioned in his tweet:  "There is already screening for those coming into the United States for those who have been in China in the last 14 days. This will be expanded to Italy and South Korea. Additionally, we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European nations as needed," Miller said.
2020-03-01	(CNN) The director of the religious group at the center of South Korea's novel coronavirus outbreak has denied responsibility for the recent spike in infections, saying authorities were trying to "exaggerate" its involvement to shift blame.  Kim Shin-chang, director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group , told CNN Sunday that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak.  The coronavirus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected 3,526 people and killed 17 in South Korea. Health authorities say more than half of all cases are related to Shincheonji -- an offshoot of Christianity -- and a specific branch in the southern city of Daegu.  South Korea's Ministry of Justice last week said that 42 Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated, to South Korea since July.  Many of the cases in other countries came from people who had traveled to Wuhan, or had been in contact with someone who had -- meaning the 42 members could have brought back the virus if they were traveling during the peak of the outbreak.  Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan. He said that while the group didn't have official travel records for all its members, "we have no record" of any coming from Wuhan into South Korea since November.  He said the outbreak began in December -- so there was no need to check members' travel history from July.  "It makes me wonder if they are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji," he said. "I would like to ask the Ministry of Justice why they did not check all Chinese and Korean citizens (traveling) from Wuhan since July, and why they only released the number of 42 (Shincheonji) members."  The Ministry of Justice said it had pulled the immigration records from July on request of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment.  'We did our best in the situation'  After identifying and announcing the Shincheonji link on February 18, South Korean authorities raced to contain the spread of the virus, tracking down thousands of attendees to trace their contacts and symptoms. It took a week before the group gave a list of member's names to authorities.  About 600 Daegu police officers were deployed to knock on doors, track phones, and scour security camera footage to find them, as members often don't answer phone calls from nonmembers.  Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said Friday that the group had also omitted some members in a list of attendees submitted to city authorities, and that he would report the group to police for "hampering the city's measures to contain the virus."  Kim apologized "to the Korean people for the worries we have caused" -- but insisted Shincheonji had been fully transparent.  "We shut down all offices to prevent further spread, and our administrative process has become delayed as all members are working from home so they can self-isolate themselves to the fullest extent," he said.  "I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation."  Kim also admitted members had been encouraged to deny being part of the group — not to conceal any vital information or to hamper the coronavirus investigation, but because "Shincheonji is perceived as a cult, and because of this many members are discriminated against."  He dismissed other accusations too, like claims by former member Duhyen Kim that illness was never accepted as a valid reason to miss services.  In February, Duhyen Kim described to CNN how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services "packed together like sardines." He and several other former members described how attendees are not allowed to wear masks during prayer time, as it was seen as "disrespectful to God."  Shincheonji religious group event.  Such claims were outdated and inaccurate, said Kim Shin Chang, adding that since January, members with symptoms had been told not to come in, or to wear masks during service.  "So there is no evidence that our service method is the reason we are seeing such an outbreak in our group," he said.  What is Shincheonji, and how did the virus spread?  Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984.  It was founded by Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a god-like figure within the group -- he is even believed to be "the second coming of Jesus Christ," said Duhyen Kim.  The virus is believed to have spread through cases who attended a Shincheonji service or were in contact with attendees, authorities say.  Between January 31 and February 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral of the founder's brother, who had been hospitalized near the southern city of Daegu.  Numerous confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths have since been recorded from the same hospital.  JUST WATCHED Inside South Korea's epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak Replay More Videos ...

A cluster of infections followed. By February 20, the national tally had increased from 31 to 156 and the first death was reported.  While tracing the movements of the 31st patient, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spotted a link between the new patients: case number 31 had attended a Shincheonji service with hundreds others in Daegu.  Once the link to the religious group was established, authorities sprang into action, quarantining attendees, disinfecting buildings, and closing down the group's services.  Shincheonji members from the John tribe in Los Angeles.  The group says it has about 245,000 members in total, with more than 31,000 from overseas. An internal document from 2017, called the "International Missions Department status report," provided to CNN by former members, said the group has eight branches in the US, with the LA chapter being the largest with more than 1,000 members, as well as dozens of chapters in China.
2020-03-01	(CNN) President Donald Trump on Sunday announced new coronavirus screening procedures for travelers to the United States, a day after his administration unveiled other measures aimed at containing the COVID-19 virus.  "In addition to screening travelers 'prior to boarding' from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America," Trump tweeted Sunday morning.  Asked which countries would fall into the "high risk" designation, Trump mentioned, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, clarified later Sunday that "this will be expanded to Italy and South Korea. Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European Nations as needed." Screening was already in place for those traveling into the US who have been in China in the last 14 days.  In a rare Saturday press conference, the Trump administration announced the State Department would raise the travel advisory level for parts of Italy and South Korea where the coronavirus has spread widely. The administration also announced expanded travel bans on Iran, another country that the virus has ravaged as it spreads across the globe.  Trump and top members of his coronavirus task force have sought to calm fears that sent markets tumbling last week.  Read More
2020-03-02	(CNN) The death toll from the novel coronavirus has passed 3,000 worldwide, as outbreaks in Italy and Iran continue to worsen and dozens of countries reported their first cases of the highly infectious illness.  The virus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected more than 88,400 people since the outbreak began last December in Wuhan, China.  The vast majority of cases and deaths are still in mainland China, concentrated in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital -- however, despite travel bans, mass quarantines and emergency measures in China, it continues to spread.  The virus has reached every continent except Antarctica, with outbreak clusters in Italy and Iran rapidly spreading to nearby countries. Case numbers are rising in Canada, the United States, South Korea, and other newly-infected places.  The first cases have also reached Latin America and Africa; in the latter, the virus has been reported in Egypt, Nigeria, and Algeria, raising concern of a possible spread across the continent.  Italy and Iran outbreaks  Iran and Italy are at the heart of the outbreaks in the Middle East and Europe. In the past 10 days, 37 countries have confirmed their first cases, mainly in these regions.  Iran now has 978 cases and 54 deaths, since announcing its first case of novel coronavirus on February 19. Neighboring countries including Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, and others have closed borders with Iran or implemented travel restrictions.  Schools have been widely suspended in Pakistan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other countries.  Meanwhile, Italy now has 1,694 cases and 34 deaths -- the most coronavirus cases of any country outside of Asia. And it's not slowing down -- on Sunday, Italy reported a 50% increase in cases compared to the previous day.  Several cities and towns in the country's north are under lockdown, with movement limited in or out of affected areas -- effectively quarantining 100,000 people.  Other countries like the US have also implemented travel restrictions to and from Italy. Two American airlines have suspended flights to Milan.  Authorities in Europe are taking precautions to prevent large gatherings of people. Many public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera house have closed, while crowded events like the Paris half-marathon have been canceled. A French official advised against a long-time French tradition -- cheek-kissing -- to avoid close physical contact.  Spreading across the Americas  New cases of the virus have begun emerging in North and South America in recent days.  Canada now has 24 cases, spread across Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec.  The United States has 89 confirmed cases -- including 44 evacuated passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three repatriated from Wuhan, 38 cases that were detected and tested on US soil and four cases "presumed positive."  The US also reported its first two deaths this weekend -- one on Saturday, and one late Sunday. Both were in Washington state , where authorities are investigating a possible outbreak at a nursing facility.  New York, Rhode Island, and Florida also reported their first cases this weekend. Patients in all three states had recently traveled to virus-hit countries -- one to Iran, and two to Italy.  President Donald Trump warned the American public that more cases were "likely," but urged them not to panic at a news conference on Saturday. He is expected to visit the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta this week.  Meanwhile, new cases in Latin and South America have raised concerns; Brazil reported its first case on February 26, marking the first time the virus had reached the continent. Only days later, Mexico, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic reported their first cases.  first case. "For several weeks, countries in the Americas have been preparing for the possible importation of cases of Covid-19," said Carissa F Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), in a statement on February 26 after Brazil reported itsfirst case.  "A multi-sectoral response to ensure strengthened surveillance, health service readiness, preventing spread, and maintaining essential services, are key interventions to slow transmission and save lives."  South Korea  In Asia, the spotlight is on South Korea, which has over 4,200 cases and 26 deaths. The youngest patient there is a 45-day-old baby.  About 60% of all nationwide cases are linked to the Shincheonji religious group and its branch in the southern city of Daegu, which has reported more than 2,500 cases.  The group, an offshoot of Christianity, faces a legal complaint filed by the Seoul city government on charges including homicide, the city announced in a news release today.  The group has been accused of withholding information or hampering officials' investigation into the virus -- but its leaders have vehemently denied these allegations.  "I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation," Kim Shin-chang, Shincheonji director of international missions, told CNN Sunday.  Kim insisted that the group had been fully transparent and cooperative, and denied the government's claim that Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan to South Korea.  "It makes me wonder if (the government ministry) are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji," he said.  South Korean authorities have contacted at least a third of all Shincheonji members, and warn that the number of cases may keep increasing in the coming days as they track down and test the remaining members for coronavirus.
2020-03-02	London (CNN Business) The coronavirus is plunging the world economy into its worst downturn since the global financial crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which warned Monday that growth could be cut in half if the outbreak continues to spread.  Global gross domestic product would grow by just 1.5% in 2020 if the coronavirus spreads widely throughout Asia, Europe and North America, the OECD said. That's roughly half the 2.9% growth rate the group projected for 2020 before the outbreak, and severe enough to push Japan and Europe into recession.  Policymakers around the world must act now to prevent such a scenario, the OECD said. It called for a coordinated global response to contain the outbreak, recommending that governments increase spending and central banks implement policies to help cushion the blow from the virus.  Even in the best-case scenario, in which the epidemic peaks in China during the first quarter and only mild outbreaks develop in other countries, the OECD predicts that the global economy would grow only 2.4%. That somewhat more optimistic forecast would still be the weakest level of growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. Global growth was about 3% last year.  "The virus risks giving a further blow to a global economy that was already weakened by trade and political tensions. Governments need to act immediately to contain the epidemic, support the health care system, protect people, shore up demand and provide a financial lifeline to households and businesses that are most affected," said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.

2020-03-02	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Monday he thinks it's "very safe" to continue hosting crowded campaign rallies around the country even as his administration contends with a growing outbreak of coronavirus in the United States.  "These were set up a long time ago," the President said in the Oval Office when asked if it was a good idea to proceed with his planned rally on Monday evening in North Carolina.  Health experts have said avoiding large crowds where the virus could spread is a good idea for older people, who appear to be more vulnerable. Some major gatherings, such as industry conferences and international summits, have been scrapped, but sporting and entertainment events in the US are proceeding as planned and Democratic presidential candidates continue to host rallies.  Trump insisted his campaign rallies, which can bring thousands of supporters into contained spaces, did not pose a risk.  "I think it's very safe," he said in the Oval Office, where he was hosting Colombia's President.  Read More
2020-03-02	(CNN) The White House coronavirus task force is expressing "great concern" there will be more person-to-person transmissions of the disease after two deaths on American soil -- a message that strongly contrasts with President Donald Trump's earlier rosy forecasts about the situation.  Top administration officials are also going out of their way to show they are ramping up to counter the widening threat as new cases spring up from coast to coast. Trump, for instance, says he plans to meet leaders from the pharmaceutical industry at the White House on Monday to discuss the search for a vaccine. "Progress being made!" the President tweeted . Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the task force, plans a late afternoon televised briefing.  But Democratic presidential candidates, led by former Vice President Joe Biden are ripping into Trump for politicizing the situation. The President, his son and his conservative media cheerleaders had earlier claimed that criticism of the administration's efforts represented an orchestrated political campaign to bring him down.  Trump fired back on Monday, accusing Democrats of being unfair.  "I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax," the President wrote. "They didn't have a clue! Now they are fear mongering," the President tweeted.  On Capitol Hill, negotiators moved closer to an emergency funding package -- perhaps worth as much as $7 billion -- far above the White House's request for a $2.5 billion one -- to battle the virus, which is on the verge of becoming a global epidemic.  Stirred by the virus, the political maelstrom gripping Washington intensified as the first two Americans perished from the coronavirus. Two men have now died from the disease in Washington state's King County. Both had underlying health issues, with one man in his 50s and the other was 70, officials said. There are now new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus or presumptive cases in California, Massachusetts, Washington state, Arizona, Illinois, Wisconsin, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York and Florida.  "We're seeing the beginning of community spread, which you know, is concerning," Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday on CNN's "New Day."  "My concern is as the next week or two or three go by, we're going to see a lot more community-related cases. That's of great concern."  As the administration confronted a fast growing crisis, Pence blanketed political talk shows Sunday in his new role as the head of the coronavirus task force. He was building on an apparent administration reset Saturday with a White House press conference involving the President and top medical officials.  Trump's earlier rambling, contentious and widely criticized first public appearance on the issue last week as well as inflammatory remarks on the virus and Democrats at a campaign rally Friday night threatened to overshadow its mitigation efforts. His previous comments that the number of US cases could soon disappear and that his administration had made "tremendous" efforts to thwart the virus arriving in the US now look premature.  On Sunday night, the President crowed about a poll that he said showed 77% of adults were confident the government could handle the situation.  "Gallup Poll numbers on the handling of this situation are outstanding, the best. Thank you!"  The poll that he was referring to, however, appeared to be one conducted between February 3-16 -- well before the deaths on US soil, the spike of new cases and the stock market routs last week that exemplified growing panic about the coronavirus.  Gallup noted at the time of the poll's release that public confidence might be based on the fact that up to that point, there had been no deaths from the virus on US soil.  Pence said an emergency effort meant that 15,000 new coronavirus tests kits were sent out over the weekend. Trump announced new travel restrictions and screenings covering Iran and parts of Italy and South Korea.  The vice president tried to keep the situation in perspective, but warned that there could be more deaths.  "For people that have other conditions -- that would militate toward a worse outcome, then we could have more, we could have more sad news, but the American people should know the risk to the average American remains low," Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."  There are now 88 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, including 44 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and three from the epicenter of the virus in Wuhan, China. There are an additional 19 travel-related cases in America, and 18 person-to-person transmissions. The origin of four other cases, in Illinois and Rhode Island is not yet established.  Pence won't criticize inflammatory comments by President's son  Pence defended the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., for saying that Democrats were rooting for "millions" of Americans to die so the coronavirus could hurt Trump politically. And he complained that the President -- who has done more to coarsen public life than any other modern politician -- had been the target of "very strong rhetoric" from his opponents and the media.  Pence, who can be a talented communicator, gave a good impression of an administration that is coordinating across various government departments and is taking the threat of the virus seriously. His assessment of the situation was more coherent than the President's comments in the news conference on Saturday, which were often light on details and sometimes contradictory. Yet like many of the President's other political appointees, Pence's habit of repeatedly pouring praise over the President's role in the crisis so far -- possibly in the expectation that his boss was watching -- in itself politicized the response effort.  In a show of focus, Trump plans to visit the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week.  But the extent to which any elected leader can control the virus, the public reaction to its spread and the political and economic reverberations that saw a stock market rout last week and fears of a global economic downturn, remains uncertain.  Biden , fresh off his victory in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, laid into Trump's handling of the crisis.  JUST WATCHED Biden: What in God's name was Trump talking about? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden: What in God's name was Trump talking about? 02:45  "The idea that Donald Trump said just several days ago this was a Democratic hoax, what in God's name is he talking about? What in God's name is he talking about? Has he no shame?" Biden said on "State of the Union."  Trump made the comment about a supposed "hoax" at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Friday night. On the defensive at his White House news conference on Saturday, he claimed, in a statement apparently contrary to the facts, that the "hoax" reference did not refer to the virus, but the use of it by Democrats to try to damage him politically.  Another Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg , bought prime-time exposure on CBS and NBC on Sunday night to assail Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and to argue that his blend of skills after years in business and as New York's mayor would enable him to do a better job.  "At times like this it is the job of the President to reassure the public that he or she is taking all the steps necessary to protect the health and well-being of every citizen," Bloomberg said.  Wary eyes on stocks after global rout  Much of the public mood going forward could depend on how stock markets regroup after the worst week since the 2008 banking crisis triggered the Great Recession. The extent of the spread of the disease inside the US will also be important. If it can be contained to hot spots and a trickle of new cases, the political impact may be moderate. But if the disease sweeps through the population, dissatisfaction with the government response could mount.  While the administration managed to largely coordinate a positive message of control over the weekend, there remain contentious questions about its handling of the crisis. For instance, there is a debate about whether the White House used the weeks between the disease's first emergence in China to properly prepare the United States for its arrival -- on issues related to hospital capacity and whether there is sufficient equipment and supplies including breathing machines for any large-scale outbreak. It remains unclear whether the public health system and hospital networks are prepared for the kind of outbreaks seen in China, South Korea and Italy for instance.

2020-03-02	New York (CNN Business) In another sign of cratering travel demand, American Airlines is suspending the fees it charges to change or cancel a flight.  American AAL Althoughdidn't mention the coronavirus in its change fee announcement on Sunday evening, fears over the outbreak have probably dented bookings for the upcoming spring break and Easter travel season, as well as summer travel. Those are among the key periods of the year for US airlines.  "[Waiving the change fee] is probably the only way I can get people to book," said Michael Boyd, an airline consultant. "There's just too much uncertainty right now among passengers. I think all the airlines are going to have to go to it at some point."  American charges varying change fees, but they can be as high as $200 for a domestic flight or $750 for an international flight changed before the day of travel. Same-day change fees range from $75 to $150.  For now, the fee waiver covers only tickets purchased between Sunday evening and March 16. To qualify, passengers must change or cancel travel plans at least 14 days before the scheduled flight. The flights can be moved to any future date for which American is taking reservations.

2020-03-02	Washington (CNN) Top US military officials said the US military is planning for all scenarios as it faces the coronavirus , including a pandemic should the spread of the virus reach that point.  "The United States military looks at a wide variety of scenarios," Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said at the Pentagon, adding that "pandemic is the worst case."  "Of course we do all kinds of planning in the department of defense," Milley told reporters, adding that the military labs are working on a vaccine. "With respect to the vaccine, yes, the military labs are working very consistently ... working in direct support with health and human services."  Milley spoke alongside Defense Secretary Mark Esper shortly after the US canceled a joint military exercise with Israel due to the coronavirus , a US defense official told CNN Monday.  The exercise, known as "Eagle Genesis" was to involve Army paratroops from the 173rd Airborne Brigade stationed in Vicenza, Italy.  "In close coordination with the Israeli government and out of an abundance of caution in the face of the evolving situation with COVID-19, the decision has been made to cancel the exercise. We value our strong partnership with Israel and look forward to continuing training together in the future," the official said.  There have been 1,600 coronavirus cases in Italy.  Commanders had already restricted access to public areas such as churches, gyms and childcare centers at US army installations in Vicenza and ordered extra Meals Ready to Eat in case they have to quarantine.  As of Monday, the virus had spread to 70 countries and regions, jumping from 50 on Friday. It has infected more than 89,000 around the world, killed more than 3,000 and is already having an impact on the military in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.  But Milley told reporters Monday that the overall impact of coronavirus on the US military has been "very minimal."  "Overseas, we have a variety of exercise operations ongoing. Right now the overall broad impact to the uniformed US military is very very minimal. That's not to say it's zero, but it's very very minimal," he said.  Last week the Pentagon canceled a key joint military training exercise in South Korea and is sending about 70 medical and lab personnel, doctors and nurses to support US forces there and to help test military, dependents and contractor personnel for the coronavirus once test kits arrive from the CDC. They will also to provide clinical care and laboratory support.  In the Middle East, United States Central Command, which overseas operations and bases there, has cancelled all liberty and leave.  Navy ships that have stopped at Pacific ports have been ordered to self-quarantine and stay at sea for two weeks to allow time to observe whether any sailors have picked up the virus.  The head of US European Command, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, told the Senate Tuesday that they are carefully monitoring the infection's impact and anticipate an increase of coronavirus cases in Germany that could lead to restricted troop movement. The lockdowns in Vicenza could be extended as well, he said.  In addition, the virus could affect the Pentagon's decision to proceed with a lengthy upcoming exercise, involving as many as 20,000 troops training against a Russian threat.  Steps by host countries in the Middle East are also affecting US troops. The resupply of US forces in Iraq is now being done by air because crossings at the land border between Iraq and Kuwait has been heavily restricted.  And more than 60 US personnel who traveled to Israel for an exercise to train against regional threats such as Iran began returning to their bases in Europe on Friday at the request of the Israeli government, although none of them were reported to be ill.
2020-03-02	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea has fired two unidentified short-range projectiles from an area near the coastal city of Wonsan into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, South Korea's military said Monday.  The objects were fired at 12:37 p.m. Korea time and estimated to have a flight distance of 240 kilometers (149 miles) and altitude of 35 kilometers (22 miles), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.  The projectiles are likely part of North Korea's combined military drills, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.  The drills began on Friday, the one-year anniversary of leader Kim Jong Un's summit in Hanoi with US President Donald Trump that ended without a deal.  North Korean state media reported that Kim presided over the exercise, which was intended to "judge the mobility and the fire power strike ability of the defense units."  Read More
2020-03-02	Goyang, South Korea (CNN) South Korea has come up with an innovative way of testing for the novel coronavirus -- and it was inspired by the drive-through counters at McDonalds and Starbucks, officials say.  Here's how it works.  In the northern city of Goyang, drivers pull in to a parking lot where they are met by health workers dressed in hazmat suits.  Motorists then drive to several stations where nurses in protective plastic suits, masks and face shields register drivers, check their temperatures, and use swabs to take samples from their throats and nasal passages.  This is a drive-through coronavirus testing site.  Officials say it is safer and faster to test for the virus at the drive-through than in a hospital or health clinic.  "There's less face-to-face contact," said Lee Jae-joon, the mayor of Goyang. "If you operate a testing site indoors, there is concern that suspected patients can infect each other in the waiting room."  "Many drive-throughs at places like Starbucks have come to South Korea," he added, explaining that health officials were inspired to replicate their model.  At the drive-through, passengers and drivers go through the entire testing process in a matter of minutes without ever getting out of their cars.  That limits the exposure of frontline workers to the virus, says Lee Eun-sook, a surgeon volunteering at the test site, and means patients aren't able to contaminate a public health facility.  Pressure on health system  The novel coronavirus outbreak is putting pressure on the Korean health system.  The number of confirmed cases has surged from 31 to more than 4,200 in two weeks, and at least 26 people have been killed by the disease in the country.  In response to the crisis, South Korea has more than 500 coronavirus testing sites, which have screened more than 100,000 people.  When the drive-through opened on February 26, it was the first of its kind in the country and has tested as many as 384 people in one day.  Health officials test patients through a car window at the drive-through site.  Results come back within three days, and are sent by SMS.  Health workers screen visitors with a questionnaire about their travel history and symptoms. Only those deemed to be at-risk will be tested.  Those who have visited Daegu, for example, are deemed more vulnerable, as 73% of all coronavirus cases in the country stem from this southern city, according to South Korea's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  Similarly, those who have links to the Shincheonji religious group in Daegu, connected to more than 50% of cases in the country, are deemed to be at risk.  About 100 workers in a gymnasium across the street from the drive-through site have been tasked with tracking down the 3,600 Shincheonji members believed to be living in Goyang.  Tough conditions  One down-side to the drive-through test site is the Korean winter weather.  "It's hard because we have to wear protective suits, we can't go to the bathroom or drink water, and it's cold," says nurse Park Seung-hee, who normally works at the city's health center.  As cars coasted past, she and other nurses huddled by gas heaters, cupping heated pads in their hands. They work here in five-hour shifts.  When their shifts ends, they step fully clothed into a small portable booth called the "Clean Zone," in which they are showered in hypochlorous acid disinfectant.  It is all in a day's work at the drive through.
2020-03-03	Amazon is informing employees that one of its Seattle-based workers has been diagnosed with coronavirus.  According to a mass email for all staff members in Seattle and Bellevue, Washington, the employee infected with the novel coronavirus first became ill on February 25 and has not been back to work since that time.  The company said it has directly notified all coworkers who had been in close contact with the patient. The worker was based at the downtown office building the company refers to as Amazon Brazil, according to the email.  An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the email to CNN, adding, “We’re supporting the affected employee.”  It was not immediately clear whether the case was included in Washington state’s count of coronavirus patients in King County, which stood at 21 on Monday.
2020-03-03	(CNN) The US Navy's 6th Fleet is instituting a 14-day self-quarantine between port visits by US Navy ships in Europe over concerns of the coronavirus, according to two US Navy officials, a move intended to bring the fleet inline with instructions from the US Pacific Fleet.  Ships will stay at sea for at least 14 days after visiting any port in Europe in order to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. A spokesman for the 6th Fleet confirmed the self-quarantine to CNN when asked.  "In conjunction with the other fleets, we have instituted a 14-day underway period between port visits to allow for crew monitoring," said Commander Kyle Raines, spokesman for the 6th Fleet.  The 6th Fleet is responsible for the US Navy presence in Europe, as well as Russia and almost all of Africa.  The precautionary move to keep its ship in the region at sea for two weeks has not impacted the Navy's ability to perform its missions there.  Read More
2020-03-03	London (CNN Business) An interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday could be followed by similar action in other leading economies around the world to limit the damage from the coronavirus outbreak.  The Fed's first emergency action since the global financial crisis was announced just hours after finance officials from the seven largest advanced economies said they were ready to act to soften the blow to businesses and households.  Investors had expected the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, but not until later this month. The US central bank said the surprise move was a response to the "evolving risks to economic activity" posed by the continued spread of the virus outside China.  Earlier, G7 finance officials participated in a conference call led by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The G7 issued a joint statement that committed them to using "all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth" but stopped short of outlining specific steps.  Speaking after the US rate cut, Powell indicated other central banks could follow with action of their own. Analysts say the European Central Bank and the Bank of England could cut rates when they meet later this month.  Read More
2020-03-03	(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday evening said that "any American can be tested" for the novel coronavirus , as the Trump administration struggled to clear up confusion and mixed signals over testing amid concerns that tests were not being made available soon enough.  Pence said in an off-camera briefing at the White House that there was new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that any American could be tested -- "no restrictions, subject to doctors' orders." The announcement follows numerous complaints of citizens asking to be tested and turned away due to the strict CDC testing criteria. Pence said the new guidance will make clear "that any clinician or health authority can administer the test."  The change was announced after confusion over how quickly the US could ramp up testing for roughly 1 million people for coronavirus. After suggesting Monday that the US would be able to test close to 1 million people for coronavirus by the end of the week, the Trump administration has since clarified -- creating more confusion among frustrated people eager to protect themselves against the virus.  The CDC on Wednesday dramatically expanded the testing criteria for the novel coronavirus, formalizing Pence's announcement. The CDC formally removed earlier restrictions that limited coronavirus testing of the general public to people in the hospital, unless they had close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases. According to the CDC, clinicians should now "use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested."  During a Senate hearing Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn was greeted by skeptical lawmakers and pushed to explain how he thinks the United States could do a million tests when, to date, it has only been able to perform about 3,600 tests.  "I want to distinguish between the ability to get the test kits out to the laboratories with the ability of the labs to actually do the tests," Hahn told lawmakers, offering no clarity on how many tests could actually be run by the end of the week.  This was among a number of government missteps that has left Americans scared and confused about how to protect themselves during the viral outbreak. Outside of US borders, countries debilitated by the virus have seen advancements in the testing process. In South Korea, there's a drive-through testing site that officials say is safer because there is "less-face-to-face" contact, and in some countries in Europe, thousands of tests are being run daily.  Yet on American soil, a botched roll out of CDC testing, combined with what some health officials now believe was too-strict criteria on who could be tested, caused a delay in testing that some health officials are increasingly concerned about.  On Capitol Hill, Pence and his coronavirus response team briefed Republicans and Democrats behind closed doors about the response to the virus, but Democrats left the briefing expressing alarm that the Trump administration was unprepared.  "We need the questions to be honest, it can't be 'well, we're going to, we're going to' -- that's not what families hear right now," said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee. "They hear, 'We will not have a test for three months, and therefore we need you to do this.' We're asking for honesty."  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was assured that over a million testing kits "are going out the door" and that testing will get "more robust" by the end of the week. He said Republicans raised concerns during the briefing about the testing so far, but that his understanding is that the additional kits and increased involvement by commercial manufactures should address that issue, agreeing with colleagues that "the key is more testing."  A senior administration official acknowledged the Trump administration is feeling a major sense of urgency to distribute testing kits for the coronavirus, amid bipartisan criticism that the kits are being deployed too slowly.  "It's a flashpoint right now," the official said.  The official conceded that the question coming in from health professionals nationwide as well from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers is "Why can't the feds give us tests?"  According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, a collection of government labs across the country, as of Tuesday evening, 56 out of 100 laboratories are currently capable of conducting the test, each one with the capability to test about 100 patients per day. APHL CEO Scott Becker noted that even if all APHL labs were up and operating at full capacity, they would only be able to test about 10,000 patients a day within the public health system.  Becker said the labs must successfully verify the CDC's test before testing for the virus.  "What we are doing right now in these next few days is playing catch up," Becker told CNN, referring to delays resulting from issues with tests delivered to labs last month. "Admittedly we were behind, but I have good confidence that we will get back on track."  A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that state and local public health labs will be able to test up to 75,000 people by the end of the week. That spokesperson added that a commercial manufacturer, IDT, is producing additional CDC tests and expects to have shipped test kits capable of about 1 million tests to academic, healthcare and commercial labs by the week's end.  One public health official who requested anonymity told CNN his lab was currently developing their own test but it would still be weeks before it was live. This official expressed frustration at the current testing situation.  "The government has not made this process easy for [health officials] to help catch cases of coronavirus before they spread," they said.  In order to receive test kits from the CDC, labs that are approved by the agency must place an order for the kit. Many state labs will still not be able to immediately run tests as soon as receiving the kit -- opting to first conduct a series of quality control tests — which will prolong the process. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 patient specimens, according to the CDC  Last month, the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly and were falsely identifying the presence of other viruses. The tests weren't able to be used for weeks because of the flaw.  On Saturday, the FDA posted new guidance "to achieve more rapid testing capacity" that allows certain US labs to test for the novel coronavirus using diagnostics the labs developed and validated on their own, even before the agency has reviewed them.  Various private companies have said they are preparing to make coronavirus tests available without providing specific timelines.  LabCorp has said on its website that the company plans to make a test available "as soon as possible." A company spokesperson did not respond to a request for more detail.  Another diagnostic company, Qiagen, tweeted that it was "ramping up production" of coronavirus test kits. Qiagen said in a statement to CNN that it's planning to submit an application to the FDA, but said the process "does take some time."  California-based company Cepheid told The New York Times that it does not expect to get FDA approval for its test before April.  Getting the tests ready is essential as the highly contagious virus continues to spread. According to the CDC, coronavirus is thought to be spread mainly from person to person. Once a person has tested positive for the virus, they can be quarantined and stem the spread.  Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the US government has taken "positive steps" in recent days when it comes to testing, such as the FDA's policy announced Saturday to allow certain labs to develop and validate their own diagnostics for tests.  But Mina added that the CDC hindered the readiness of labs by announcing last month that some test kits shipped to labs were not working as they should but then providing limited information to labs in the weeks that followed.  Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Monday that while the US has seen an increase in coronavirus cases, there's no need to panic.  "Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not," he said.  Lawmakers continue to press for additional information about the response to the virus. House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney of New York and other top Oversight Democrats sent letters to Health and Human Services and the CDC seeking more information on testing, diagnoses and the costs of treating coronavirus.  Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, sent letters to airlines and airports to ask about their plans to deal with the Coronavirus outbreak and their pandemic response plans.  And Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Tuesday that tests should be free for anyone who experiences symptoms from the virus.  This story has been updated to reflect the CDC's new guidance on testing for coronavirus.
2020-03-03	Hong Kong (CNN) The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that public health officials are operating in "uncharted territory" as they combat the spread of the novel coronavirus , which has infected more than 90,000 people across 73 countries and territories as of Monday evening.  The virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica since it was first identified in December last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Medical workers are now battling deadly outbreak clusters in South Korea, Iran and Italy, while other countries are working furiously to avoid a similar fate by readying public health authorities, alerting their citizens and enacting travel restrictions to affected areas.  To date, there have been 172 deaths reported outside mainland China, raising the global death toll to 3,115.  Several nations that have seen cases are putting in place measures to limit the virus' spread: closing schools, encouraging remote work and canceling or scaling back public events, just to name a few.  The WHO has so far held off on classifying the incident as a global pandemic , but has warned it is a possibility in the near future.  "We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the global health watchdog.  Knowing & understanding an epidemic is the first step to defeating it.  We are in unchartered territory with #COVID19. We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures. — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) March 2, 2020  Investors are also bracing for the possibility that the spread of COVID-19, as the virus is formally known, could throw the global economy into recession. Its spread in China, the world's second-biggest economy and a major manufacturer, was followed by factory closures that severely impacted global supply chains.  At least 80,151 cases have been identified in mainland China to date, killing 2,943 people.  However, the economic effects of the virus now go beyond China, as the virus is impacting business operations and consumer behavior worldwide. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the virus plunged the world economy into its worst downturn since the 2009 global financial crisis and that growth could be cut in half if the outbreak continues unabated.  Major clusters outside China  Cases outside mainland China appear to be spreading faster than inside, as the outbreak shows signs of stabilizing in parts of the country, following weeks of restrictions and emergency measures. The WHO's Ghebreyesus said on Monday that "in the last 24 hours, there were almost nine times more COVID-19 cases reported outside China than inside."  According to China's National Health Commission (NHC) confirmed cases in mainland China increased by 125 Monday. Of those cases, 114 were in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the provincial capital.  China's two most populous cities, Shanghai and Beijing, have enforced quarantines for people who recently visited countries with significant outbreaks.  at least 2,336 cases and 77 deaths -- South Korea, Iran and Italy are facing the most severe outbreaks excluding mainland China. Authorities in Seoul said Tuesday that more than 4,800 infections had been identified, killing 28 people. Italian officials have reported at least 1,835 infected patients and 52 deaths. And Iran has announcedat least 2,336 cases and 77deaths -- including an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Several of Iran's neighbors have taken steps to avoid the spread, including closing borders with the country.  Authorities in Europe are also taking early precautions. Several governments are preventing large gatherings of people in order to curb community transmission, as well as closing public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera. Crowded events like the Paris half-marathon have been canceled. And one French official advised against a long-time French greeting of two kisses on the cheek to avoid close physical contact.  The European Union's alert level for the novel coronavirus has been raised from moderate to high, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a Monday news conference. There are more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the EU, with the bulk of the outbreak happening in Italy.  The United States has also seen an uptick in cases, with more than 100 infections now identified after a surge of new patients Washington state, where six people have been killed. Four of the people who died were residents of a nursing care facility in Kirkland, in suburban Seattle, eliciting concerns that the virus may have spread within Washington in recent days or weeks. Washington remains the only state in the US where the spread of the virus has resulted in fatalities.  The new cases have prompted private companies to take their own proactive measures. Twitter is asking its employees to work from home, Carnival Cruise lines is changing some of its itineraries and the NBA is asking its players to avoid taking items from fans to autograph and offer strangers fist-bumps instead of high-fives.  JUST WATCHED US coronavirus death toll now at least 6, with more than 100 sick Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US coronavirus death toll now at least 6, with more than 100 sick 02:35  However, federal public health authorities have issued several calls for calm. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said the government "knew this was coming."  "Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not," he said.  President Donald Trump said Monday he was still considering additional travel restrictions from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks. Vice President Mike Pence, who was appointed to the head of President Trump's coronavirus task force, said new travel advisories have been put in place for Italy and South Korea, and anyone traveling to the United States on a flight from Italy and South Korea will receive multiple screenings before arriving in the United States.  But he also advised Americans that the virus does not pose a major threat to them.  "Let's be clear: The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government," Pence said.

2020-03-04	South Korea confirmed three new deaths and 438 additional cases of the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  The three deaths bring the nation's death toll to 35, and the latest cases bring the total number of infections to 5,766, according to the KCDC.  Among the 438 new cases, 320 are from Daegu city where the outbreak has been concentrated. In total, 4,326 cases have been from Daegu, with many of them linked to the Shincheonji religious group.  Another 87 of the new cases are from North Gyeongsang Province, which surrounds Daegu.  Around 90% of the nation's cases are from Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province.
2020-03-04	(CNN) Since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in China last December, it has spread across the world and now threatens to become a global pandemic.  The virus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected more than 90,000 people globally and killed more than 3,000. Though the majority of cases and deaths remain in mainland China, these past two weeks have seen self-sustaining clusters form in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States -- and new cases reported in Africa and Latin America.  Countries are now scrambling to contain the virus, imposing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines -- an echo of the shutdowns and emergency measures that swept across Asia two months ago.  As Asia continues to grapple with rising numbers of infections, here are ten lessons -- good and bad -- from the region on how to deal with a coronavirus outbreak.  Be transparent with the public  Government transparency and publicly accessible information can help educate citizens on the risks and necessary precautionary measures, as well as avoid panic or misinformation.  Singapore, for example, sends out daily briefings on coronavirus updates -- how many new cases are confirmed, how many patients have been discharged from hospital, and whether new clusters are appearing.  And in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, government agencies have launched aggressive public information campaigns on what is being done and what citizens can do, distributing this information on citywide posters, television ads, and more.  In Japan, regular flu cases have dropped dramatically -- reportedly because of this rise in public education and health awareness, according to local media.  A lack of reliable information can also give rise to baseless rumors. In Singapore, a false claim that a foreign domestic worker had died took hold. The government quickly released a statement clarifying that was false; nobody has died of coronavirus in Singapore thus far.  Transparency helps reduce hysteria, and gives other countries and international experts important information in understanding the spread of the virus.  Crucially, government willingness to share hard truths -- with both the public and internally within government -- can help avoid fatal missteps, such as those made in China during the early weeks of the outbreak.  In December, when the virus first began spreading, whistleblowers like Li Wenliang , in the Chinese city of Wuhan, tried to warn people -- but were silenced by authorities. Li, who was made to sign a police statement about his "misdemeanor," died in February of the virus, sparking public fury and deep mistrust of the government.  Conduct social distancing  The virus spreads when people are in close physical contact -- so one of the most important measures a government or its people can take is social distancing.  Social distancing is exactly what it sounds like -- putting some distance between yourself and others, and avoiding situations where you might be close to many other people.  To this end, countries across Asia have suspended schools, canceled public gatherings such as Lunar New Year festivities, closed public spaces like swimming pools, and recommended people work from home.  In China, more than 780 million people -- about half the country's population -- are still under some form of travel restrictions, as part of the effort to limit people's exposure to each other.  We're already starting to see some of these social distancing measures come into effect in big cities across Europe, where the outbreak began in Italy in mid-February.  More than 100 schools have closed in France's Oise region, affecting more than 28,000 students. The Louvre museum in Paris and the famed La Scala opera house in Milan both closed, and the Paris half-marathon has been canceled.  The Louvre was shut for three days, then re-opened on Wednesday, announcing in a Facebook statement that its doors are open.  Be ahead of the game  Authorities can prepare for an outbreak even before the virus arrives in large numbers.  In January, as it became clear that the virus was spreading rapidly across Asia, countries got ready by setting up quarantine centers, ordering more medical supplies in advance, and organizing cross-departmental government emergency response committees.  Taiwan formed an epidemic response command center and in late January; that same week, the island confirmed its first case. Other preemptive measures included preparing more than 1,000 beds in isolation wards, conducting drills at hospitals and facilities for infection control, and stocking up on medical supplies to counter rumors of shortages.

These restrictions range from complete lockdowns, to limited entry in and out of certain neighborhoods. Hide Caption 24 of 24  And in Thailand, the first place the virus spread outside China, authorities set up widespread temperature screenings at transport hubs days after the first case.  Some countries like the US and UK have begun adopting similar measures.  San Francisco declared a state of emergency -- allowing the city to get reimbursed by state and federal governments for money it spends on preparedness.  And New York has been preparing for weeks. In February, the city distributed about 1.5 million face masks, and asked for an additional minimum of 300,000 masks, and has prepared at least 1,200 hospital beds for potential coronavirus patients.  Get tested early  Countries can also encourage early testing, and make testing available across local districts, to identify the arrival of the virus fast.  South Korea is a good example of widespread, early testing and heightened vigilance in reporting symptoms -- the country's health ministry has rolled out a smartphone app that asks citizens to do a daily check of their symptoms, and to notify local health officials if necessary.  The South Korean city of Goyang has even set up a drive-through coronavirus testing site : people drive into a parking lot, where health workers in hazmat suits register drivers, check their temperatures, and take samples.  Drivers go through the entire testing process in a matter of minutes without ever getting out of their cars -- making it easy for more people to get tested quickly, as well as protecting healthcare workers from exposure to the virus.  These kinds of measures allow authorities to quarantine patients and the people they have been in contact with, thus containing the virus quickly, rather than allow it to spread with untested infected people in the community.  Spread good hygiene practices  Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough, avoiding touching your eyes or mouth with your hands, and being cautious of the surfaces you touch can make a big difference.  Countries across Asia launched public awareness campaigns, with governments spreading tips on how to keep good hygiene.  In cities like Hong Kong, people have taken to wearing gloves when they go out, and using disinfectant or alcohol wipes to regularly clean surfaces. One common practice is to cover elevator buttons in buildings with a plastic sheet, making it easy to disinfect the surface every few hours.  In places where schools have yet to be suspended fully, some schools do daily hand-washings -- all students line up to wash their hands before meals or at the end of the school day.  Similar institutional campaigns an higher personal awareness among citizens can help prevent and contain the spread of the virus globally.  Offer employees flexible working arrangements  Millions of people in Asia have been working from home, or working more flexible hours, for over a month. Some companies have sent all non-essential employees home, while others have adopted a tag team method, with groups of employees taking turns coming into the office.  There certainly are difficulties -- if schools are suspended, parents working from home may also need to care for their children, and working remotely isn't practical for some in customer service industries of front-of-house roles.  But modern technology also makes it easier to have entire companies work from home: Asian companies have been using tools like video conferencing, instant messaging applications, VPN systems and cloud-based filing.  In Hong Kong, some employees told CNN that they were frustrated their employers didn't allow them to work remotely, as they felt it put them at a higher risk of infection.  Don't panic buy  In Hong Kong, the month of February was marked by panic buying and empty store aisles.  People feared closed borders could disrupt the supply line of toilet rolls -- despite the government's reassurances that it wouldn't -- and rushed to stock up. Supermarkets sold out, with some people bulk-buying enough to last them weeks.  And it's not just toilet rolls -- people have also been snatching up face masks, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, and food staples like rice.  The panic buying stoked unnecessary chaos and fear, and even led to crime -- in Hong Kong, several men were arrested last month for stealing 600 toilet rolls that had been delivered outside a supermarket.  There are plenty of reasons to refrain from jumping on the panic buying bandwagon; it takes away critical supplies for frontliners and health care workers, and spreads hysteria. And often, the supply chains are fine -- CNN spoke with two major Hong Kong supermarkets, two shipping companies, and two container operators, all of which said there was no shortage or disruption of supplies.  Don't be afraid of your pets  A dog tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong last week, sparking incorrect fears that pets may be able to catch and transmit the virus to their owners.  Experts agree: that's almost definitely not the case.  Coronaviruses can live on surfaces and objects -- meaning the virus could be present on the surface of a dog or cat, even if the dog or cat hasn't actually contracted the virus  "Present evidence suggests that dogs are no more of a risk of spreading (coronavirus) than inanimate objects such as door handles," wrote Sheila McClelland, the founder of Hong Kong-based Lifelong Animal Protection Charity, in a letter to city authorities shared with CNN.  So don't quarantine your pets, stick face masks on them, or abandon them -- just stick to the basics of good hygiene. Wash your hands after touching your pets, and if you're really concerned, wipe your pets' paws with antiseptic wipes after they've been outside.  Don't stigmatize patients  As the virus spreads, so does fear, paranoia, and discrimination.  Experts have warned against stigmatizing patients; for instance, quarantines are undoubtedly vital to the containment process, but if done improperly, patients could potentially be treated with less dignity and respect.  And in largely white countries like the US, UK, and Australia, stigma can take a more xenophobic, at times outright racist, form -- there has been an uptick of racist assaults and harassment in these places, targeted at people of Chinese or East Asian descent.  It's also why the director general of the World Health Organization urged countries not to impose trade bans in February, warning that it could feed "fear and stigma, with little public health benefit."  "Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves," he added.  And finally -- don't panic  While governments and citizens should prepare for the virus, it's also important not to panic.  Based on current available data, the virus is thought to have a fatality rate of about 2% -- that's higher than influenza, which is about 0.1%, but much lower than severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, (9.6%) and MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (35%).  For many people, symptoms are just like those of a common cold, and may go away on their own.  In China, more than half of all cases have recovered and been discharged from hospital -- 47,204 out of a total of 80,151 cases, according to the country's National Health Commission.  For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a more serious illness such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with symptoms that feel worse than a standard cold should see their doctor.
2020-03-04	(CNN) When the novel coronavirus outbreak hit China in late December and January, the government sprang into crisis mode.  Hard-hit cities like Wuhan, where the outbreak began, went into complete lockdown. Millions worked from home or self-quarantined for weeks on end. New hospitals were built in a matter of days to treat the sheer number of patients. People who broke quarantine rules or lied about their travel history were detained.  These measures were drastic -- but they appear to be paying off, with the situation slowly stabilizing in mainland China, and the rate of new cases decreasing daily.  "We've seen the comprehensive measures that China has taken and ... we believe that that has had an impact on changing the natural trajectory of the outbreak in China," said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday.  Mainland China recorded 119 new cases of the virus as of the end of Tuesday, with all but four in Hubei province -- the figures in line with the downward trend in China.  Instead, the Covid-19 crisis has spread abroad, with alarming new clusters of the disease in the United States, Middle East and Europe. Scenes once limited to China and East Asia -- ubiquitous face masks, sold-out hand sanitizer and toilet rolls, disinfected trains and empty public spaces -- are now being seen globally as authorities worldwide scramble to contain the outbreak.  The United States  The US now has 126 coronavirus cases and nine deaths, with the majority of infections in California and Washington states.  Many cities across the country, including San Francisco and Seattle, and even entire states like Washington, have declared states of emergency. This allows the local and state authorities greater access to emergency resources and funding in preparation for a bigger outbreak.  Federal agencies are also working on a response: the US military says military labs are working on a vaccine, while the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just authorized health care workers to use a wider variety of respirators, giving them greater flexibility as face mask supplies run low.  However, the government has also hit snags. There are widespread concerns about the accessibility of testing kits, while a botched roll-out of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) testing, and strict criteria on who could be examined, caused a delay in testing.  The US has only been able to perform about 3,600 tests so far -- especially striking when compared to countries like South Korea and in Europe, where thousands of tests are being run daily.  The FDA commissioner initially said the US should be able to perform about 1 million tests by the end of this week -- but clarified later that there was a difference "between the ability to get the test kits out to the laboratories with the ability of the labs to actually do the tests."  There is also confusion around other federal policies, like quarantines and travel restrictions; the Trump administration announced new rules in early February, but offered few details, leaving local officials scrambling to figure it out. San Antonio, Texas has even filed a lawsuit against the federal government over a disagreement in quarantine protocol.  Among citizens, anxiety over the virus appears to be rising. Face masks and hand sanitizer have sold out in many places; one California woman told CNN she visited 15 stores over two days, only to find a single box of masks available.  Italy, Europe and the UK  The European outbreak first took hold in Italy, but has now spread across the continent. The European Union (EU) has raised the risk level from moderate to high, warning that every country needs to prepare for the outbreak.  In Italy, where 79 people have died, cities and towns in the north have been placed under full or partial shutdown, effectively quarantining 100,000 people.  Schools are suspended, public spaces like swimming pools or parks are closed, and major events closed to reduce the risk of infection.  An Italian government task force is working around the clock to manage confirmed cases, oversee nationwide health procedures, and work with international agencies like the WHO and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.  Elsewhere in the EU, deaths linked to the virus have been reported in France and Spain, which have nearly 400 cases combined.  International travel restrictions have been put into place -- for instance, countries and airlines from the US to Kenya have suspended flights to Italy -- but EU borders remain open, with EU health ministers warning that border closures would be a "disproportionate and ineffective measure."  EU member countries have come together for a broader coordinated response, with an EU task force that covers responses in the medical field, mobility and travel, and economic impact.  The United Kingdom also formed a "battle plan" against the virus, and has rolled out virus testing across 12 labs nationwide. Nearly 14,000 people have been tested across the UK so far.  Asia-Pacific region  In Asia, the spotlight remains on South Korea, which has the largest number of patients outside mainland China. More than half of its 5,612 cases are linked to a branch of the Shincheonji religious group in the country's south.  In response, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday that the country "has entered a war against" the coronavirus. The government has proposed an extra budget of about $9.8 billion in response and recovery, which will be submitted for approval on Thursday.  Authorities have aggressively rolled out testing across the country, even setting up drive-through testing stations where people can get tested in minutes, all without leaving their cars.  They have also employed creative technologies in this "war," like a GPS system that sets off an alarm when patients violate quarantine at home.  In South Korea, and other places in Asia like Singapore and Hong Kong, there have been massive information campaigns to educate the public on basic but crucial preventative measures like washing hands, staying away from crowds, and not touching your face.  Millions are still working from home across Asia, with both government departments and private companies implementing flexible or remote working arrangements for better social distancing.  Events and public gatherings have been canceled for the same reason -- in Japan, the Rugby Sevens invitational tournament was canceled over coronavirus fears.  Governments in these places have also had to address unexpected issues like panic buying, which saw toilet rolls and face masks sell out across supermarkets in Hong Kong.  The same issue is now being seen in Australia, which announced additional cases this week after nearly a month of no new cases -- images from cities like Sydney and Brisbane show empty grocery store aisles and crowds jostling for products.  In response, governments have urged people not to panic buy, and said that there was no threat to supply. Supermarkets have also imposed limits on how much shoppers can buy of items like toilet roll.  Iran and the Middle East  Iran is at the heart of the Middle East outbreak; the country has reported more than 2,300 cases and 77 deaths. Nearly 8% of the country's lawmakers have tested positive for the virus.  Iran has mobilized a nationwide team of 300,000 health workers and specialists, its deputy health minister announced Tuesday. International experts from the WHO also landed in Tehran this week to work with health authorities and coordinate a response effort.  Those trying to leave the city of Qom -- ground zero for Iran's outbreak -- will be quarantined if they have a fever and display symptoms of coronavirus, the government said Wednesday.  Iran has also taken more unusual measures, like temporarily releasing more than 54,000 prisoners in an attempt to prevent the virus' spread.  In the past two weeks alone, the virus has spread to about a dozen other Middle Eastern countries. Many countries have shut borders with Iran or imposed travel restrictions, while several including Qatar, Turkey, and Kuwait have ordered the evacuation of their citizens from Iran.  Iraq has closed all schools, cinemas, cafes, and other public spaces for two weeks, and is banning its citizens from traveling to virus-hit countries like Iran, Kuwait, and Bahrain.  Africa and Latin America  Though there is no large outbreak of the virus in Africa or Latin America, several countries in those regions reported their first cases last week, raising concerns the virus may continue spreading.  In Africa, cases have been confirmed in Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia.  After confirming the country's first case, Nigerian authorities expressed confidence in their ability to handle the outbreak, saying the West African Ebola outbreak had prepared the continent well.  However, the WHO has warned that an outbreak could hit Africa much harder than it did China. There are obstacles that could complicate hygiene practices and virus containment; only 42% of Nigerians have access to soap and water on their premises, while 25% have no access to water at all.  The continent is now preparing preventative measures, such the monitoring of entry points and border crossings by soldiers.  Experts from the WHO have been sent to particularly vulnerable countries, and the agency is providing African laboratories with testing equipment, reagents for chemical analysis, and staff training.  Meanwhile, in Latin America and the Caribbean, cases have been confirmed in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic.  Similar to US states and cities, countries like Mexico, Guatemala and Panama have declared states of emergency or high-level alerts in preparation for a greater outbreak.  Even countries with no confirmed cases aren't taking any chances -- Panama has dedicated $2.5 million for a virus response, launched a public information campaign, and is conducting training sessions for healthcare workers.
2020-03-04	Hong Kong (CNN) Countries worldwide are preparing for the possibility of public health emergencies related to the novel coronavirus , as the World Health Organization warned a shortage of protective equipment is hampering the response to the outbreak.  The virus has infected more than 92,800 people and killed at least 3,200 since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. It has now spread to more than 75 countries and territories , with self-sustaining clusters forming in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.  At a news briefing Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that each month, the organization estimates that about 89 million medical masks, 76 million examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles will be required globally for health care workers to respond to the outbreak.  "Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other front line health care workers dangerously ill-equipped," said Ghebreyesus. "The WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but supplies are rapidly depleting."  The dire warning comes as China announced a further drop in new cases, raising hopes that the outbreak is beginning to level off in the hard-hit country. Though the vast majority of the total number of confirmed cases and deaths are inside of China, the number of new daily infections outside of the country now exceeds those inside.  The Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said that 115 infections and 37 deaths related to the coronavirus were confirmed Tuesday in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the provincial capital. The rest of mainland China, excluding Hubei, saw only one death and four infections, the NHC reported, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in the country to at least 2,981 deaths and 80,270 cases.  To date, nearly 50,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, the NHC reported.  The WHO has said it is working with governments, manufacturers and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost production and secure supplies for at-risk countries. However, it is predicted globally supplies will need to be increased by 40% to meet demand.  Infections in Iran, one of the most critically affected countries, have now surged to more than 2,300 cases -- which includes about 8% of the country's parliament -- and 77 deaths, including an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  South Korea confirmed one new death and 516 more cases of the novel coronavirus Tuesday, bringing the national death toll to 32 and the total number of confirmed cases to 5,328, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Among the 516 new cases, 405 are from the city of Daegu, where the outbreak has been concentrated.  And in Europe, authorities are taking early precautions to stop potential spreading. Several governments are preventing large gatherings of people in order to curb community transmission, and closing public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera house.  In Italy, at least 79 people have been killed by the virus and more than 2,500 have been infected. Most of the cases have been reported in the country's north.  Market concerns  The coronavirus and its knock-on effects have rattled markets worldwide, with investors concerned that measures aimed to stop the virus' spread could stop business from functioning as normal.  The World Bank pledged to give $12 billion to more than 60 countries affected by the virus, while the United States and Europe are also taking steps to combat the virus' potential economic effects. The US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday , a bold attempt to give the US economy a jolt in the face of concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.  It was the first unscheduled, emergency rate cut since 2008. But although the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, "the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," the central bank said in a statement.  JUST WATCHED Federal Reserve announces emergency rate cut Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Federal Reserve announces emergency rate cut 02:24  Finance officials from the G7 major economies issued a joint statement that committed them to using "all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth" but stopped short of outlining specific steps.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that global economic growth could be cut in half this year if the outbreak continues to spread. It called for an immediate response to contain the outbreak, recommending that governments increase spending and central banks implement policies to help cushion the blow from the virus.  US counts more than 100 cases  The US has now identified at least 126 coronavirus cases, which include 45 Americans who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship in Japan and three from Wuhan, and another 78 detected and tested in the United States through the US public health systems. Those numbers include presumptive positive cases that tested positive in public health labs and are pending confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control.  Nine people have died of the virus in the US, all in the state of Washington. Many of the state's 27 reported infections are believed to be connected to a nursing home near Seattle. California is the next hardest hit state, with 27 cases and no deaths.  Federal public health authorities have issued several calls for calm . US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said the government "knew this was coming."  "Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not," he said.  Vice President Mike Pence has also advised Americans that the virus does not pose a major threat to them.  "Let's be clear: The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government," Pence said.
2020-03-04	New York (CNN Business) The market has been whipsawed by fears about the coronavirus. But one sector has plunged even more than the broader market in the past few days: transportation stocks, whose fortunes are inexorably intertwined with the macroeconomy.

The virus could also affect the Pentagon's decision to proceed with a lengthy upcoming exercise, involving as many as 20,000 troops training against a Russian threat.  The US military is planning for all scenarios as it faces the coronavirus, including a pandemic should the spread of the virus reach that point, according to top Pentagon officials.  Read More

2020-03-05	Tokyo (CNN) Concerns are growing in Japan that the number of coronavirus cases could be higher than reported, with experts questioning the country's approach to testing as infection rates continue to climb.  Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak -- specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.  In neighboring South Korea, infections have surged dramatically , with more than 6,000confirmed cases after the government tested tens of thousands of people as part of a mass screening drive. But although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4, according to the country's Health Ministry.  On Wednesday, Japan recorded 33 new cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, its highest one-day increase since the outbreak began, according to numbers released by the Health Ministry. The overall total now stands at 1,023, of which 706 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  But Japan's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported, with the infection rate suspected to be just the "tip of the iceberg," according to Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, a non-profit group.  Kami says for every one patient tested, there are many more who remain undiagnosed. But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they don't go to a clinic to get checked out.  Guidelines from the Health Ministry say people should get tested if they have cold-like symptoms, a fever of 37.5 Celsius, or experience extreme tiredness or breathing problems for four days or more. In the meantime, they should self-quarantine.  Senior citizens or people with preexisting medical conditions that put them at higher risk should seek testing if they exhibit symptoms for two or more days, according to the guidelines.  The advice was given to prevent people from inundating clinics and hospitals. But it has done little to soothe public anxiety or curb the spread of the virus.  A large crowd wearing masks commutes through Shinagawa Station in Tokyo, Tuesday, March 3, 2020.  Inadequate testing scheme  In Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, the governor has declared a state of emergency. The popular tourist spot has been particularly hard hit, accounting for more than a quarter of all non-cruise ship related cases in the country.  But while the official number of people infected with coronavirus in Hokkaido may now be in the 80s, the actual number is likely to be ten times higher, said Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido university. Nishiura, who is assisting the government in creating statistical models to help predict the spread of the virus, said the estimated figure is consistent with what he had seen in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak.  Japan's Health Ministry, however, has so far refuted Nishiura's estimates. It suggested Japan is likely to have around 3,000 coronavirus cases in total. "We understand there are people we have not detected," the ministry said in a statement provided to CNN.  The ministry added it was aware "many people want to take the test" and that it would "expand the target range" to include people showing "mild symptoms."  Irrespective of the total figure, it is likely the coronavirus infection rate will rise as more people are tested, said Kenji Shibuya director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization.  In order to ease public anxiety, tests in Japan should become more widely available, with priority given to senior citizens, who are most at risk, said Shibuya.  Though Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is considering the possibility of declaring a nationwide state of emergency that would grant more powers to local authorities to enforce a ban on public gatherings and encourage people to stay at home, Shibuya suggested the government should focus on preparing contingency plans in the event of a larger outbreak.  According to Shibuya, it is important to treat those who are critically ill and protect those most at risk, as even asymptomatic people can pass the virus on to others.  Kami, of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, corroborated that view, noting that the most important thing is to prevent infections in old people in nursing homes, hospitals and houses.  "If senior citizens are infected they become seriously ill and their mortality rate (with the coronavirus) is more than 10%," said Kami.  A carriage on a train is nearly empty as it travels from Shinjuku to the toursi resort of Hakone on March 3, 2020 in Hakone, Japan.  'Biggest threat is panic, not the virus itself'  The coronavirus has spread from China, to more than 75 countries and regions, killing more than 3,200 people and infecting more than 95,000 people globally.  And as the outbreak casts a shadow over the economy and Tokyo's preparations to host the Summer Olympics, Abe has stressed that the next couple of weeks will be crucial in the battle to contain its spread.  Japan has already started to take a number of precautions to overcome and prevent the spread of the virus.  Many large-scale public gatherings and sporting events have been scaled down or canceled. Japanese companies have also adopted the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and in offices.  But critics have accused Abe of prioritizing the Olympics and bilateral ties over national security, particularly as Japan did not shut down its borders during the early stages of the outbreak.  "The Japanese government has taken relative soft stance when it comes to blocking the flow of people from China to Japan compared to some other countries," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University.  Nakano said this angered both Abe's supporters and opponents.  Last week, a decision by most schools to shut down also sparked criticism, with many parents unsure of how they would cope in a country where nannies and domestic helpers are uncommon.  As anxiety grew, many rushed out to stock up on goods such as toilet and tissue paper after an online rumor alleged that most of Japan's supplies came from China, where factories were shutting down.  And with masks and hand sanitizer already in short supply, Shibuya said that panic poses a bigger threat than the virus itself.  "In the end, Covid-19 is a mild cold for the majority of people, the biggest fear is not the virus itself but the panic, which is happening unfortunately," said Shibuya.
2020-03-05	Hong Kong (CNN) A spike in novel coronavirus in India has prompted concerns that the world's second-most populous country could face a serious outbreak of the virus, which to date has infected more than 95,000 people and killed at least 3,300 worldwide.  Twenty-nine cases have been confirmed inside the country, including three who have recovered. Many of the cases are linked to a group of travelers from Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said.  Authorities in the country have advised caution, but have not raised the alarm. Vardhan told lawmakers in parliament Tuesday that public health authorities are focusing on India's "core capacities for disease preparedness and response."  The government has begun screening all passengers arriving in the country for coronavirus.  "The scale and extent of our interventions have increased in alignment the evolving situation of COVID-19 across the world, and India in particular," he said, referring to the disease by its formal name. "With the increasing global spread of the disease, we are confronted with new challenges. The contact tracing of positive cases requires the tracing of hundreds of contacts in multiple locations and monitoring their health."  Vardhan also said the government was preparing a "containment plan" for the city of Agra -- home to the Taj Mahal -- where a cluster of cases has been identified.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said "there is no need to panic" earlier this week on Twitter and advised the public that the government is "working together" to stop the virus from spreading further.  Modi said Wednesday he would not attend next week's Holi celebrations -- the Hindu festival that marks the start of spring in which revelers throwing bright-colored powdered paint -- because of advice from experts to avoid mass gatherings. Holi festivities at the presidential palace were also canceled.  Authorities around the globe are taking similar steps now that the virus has spread to more than 80 countries and territories across every continent except Antarctica. Since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, major self-sustaining clusters have formed in South Korea, Japan -- which recorded its biggest one-day increase of cases on Wednesday , with 33 new patients identified -- parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.  The vast majority of cases, however, are still in mainland China. The country's National Health Commission (NHC) reported that as of the end of the day Wednesday, 3,012 people had died and 80,409 cases had been confirmed. More than 52,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, per the NHC.  Economic woes  The virus' spread is also having significant knock-on effects on the global economy and daily life. Markets worldwide have reacted negatively, forcing finance officials and central banks to take action. Government agencies and private companies across the globe have canceled or postponed public functions.  Movie studios MGM and Universal have postponed the release of the latest James Bond movie ; authorities in Japan and Italy have closed major tourist hubs like the Tokyo Skytree or Milan's Teatro alla Scala; theme parks around the world have been shuttered; governments have shut schools; and sporting events in country's most affected areas are sometimes being played behind closed doors.  The outbreak could cost the Travel and tourism has been among the most affected industries.The outbreak could cost the airline industry as much as $113 billion in lost revenue, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  IATA said global passenger growth for January 2020 was the slowest in nearly a decade, climbing only 2.4% from a year earlier, because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.  "January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January," Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO, said in a statement.  United Airlines became the first airline to cut its US flight schedule on Wednesday, as passenger concerns about the coronavirus has caused a sharp drop in demand. UK airline Flybe collapsed Thursday as a slump in demand for flights due to the outbreak dealt the final blow to the struggling carrier.  Passenger uncertainty about travel has prompted major US airlines and some international ones to suspend or waive certain change and rebooking fees, which itself is hurting their revenue.  Executives from most of the major airlines, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, met with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday to discuss the impact of the coronavirus on air travel and how to coordinate activity between the industry and the government.  In response to a question, President Trump said he did not believe that the airlines would need a bailout, similar to the one they received in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  "Don't ask that question please, because they haven't asked (for) that. I don't want you to give them any ideas," said Trump about the possibility of a bailout. He said the idea had not been discussed. He also said he believes flying is safe.  "Where these people are flying, it's safe to fly," he said.

"Our objective is to make tests available broadly to the American public. We want to make sure the American people can go to their doctor, can go to the local MedCheck or CVS, and obtain access," said Pence, who Trump tasked with overseeing the federal government's coronavirus task force.  Speaking at a news conference, Pence highlighted the various steps the government is taking to stop the virus from spreading further.  "The risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But at the President's direction, we are bringing the full resources, not just of the American government, but the American economy, to make sure that in our meeting with the pharmaceutical companies, that we have -- that we're developing vaccines, which may not be available for another year or year and a half, but we're also developing therapeutics that we believe could be available in fairly short order for people that are struggling with coronavirus," he said.

Ten of the fatalities occurred in Washington state , where many of the patients and victims have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. A federal disaster medical assistance team is set to arrive in Kirkland Thursday to help staff at the facility.  The other fatality is in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. Those two states have so far been the hardest-hit, with Washington detecting at least 39 infections and California at least 36.  Newsom also said that one cruise ship off the coast of California, the Grand Princess, has been affected by the outbreak, with 10 crew members and 11 passengers showing virus symptoms. The ship is being held at sea while authorities test for the virus.  Cruise ships can be especially vulnerable to viral illnesses, like the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were infected while aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise liner that was forced to quarantine most of its guests off the coast of Japan. Forty-six Americans on board the ship who were repatriated from Japan have tested positive for the virus, according to the CDC.  "There are unique challenges, our experts tell us, in a closed environment" like a cruise ship, Pence said at his Wednesday briefing.  The House of Representatives passed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response package Wednesday afternoon, far higher than the $2.5 billion the White House requested. Despite that, however, the White House is expected to back the deal. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the measure Thursday.
2020-03-05	London (CNN Business) Global airlines stand to lose $113 billion in sales if the coronavirus continues to spread, according to the International Air Transport Association.  The losses would be similar to those experienced by the aviation industry during the global financial crisis of 2008, IATA warned as it dramatically increased its estimate of the damage caused by the outbreak. It said airlines could lose 19% of their business if the virus isn't contained soon.  Just two weeks ago, IATA had been expecting lost sales in the range of $30 billion.  "The turn of events as a result of [the coronavirus] is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry's prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse," Alexandre de Juniac, the CEO of the industry group, said in a statement. "It is unclear how the virus will develop, but ... this is a crisis."  Airlines in Europe and Asia would bear the brunt of the pain, according to IATA. Carriers in Asia Pacific could lose out on sales worth $58 billion.  Read More

2020-03-05	But the administration has still not explained why Washington has been so slow to distribute testing kits in bulk and has dragged its feet on removing restrictions for who can conduct diagnosis. And Pence's efforts, which are winning qualified praise from some Capitol Hill Democrats , risk being undermined by the President's inflammatory and inaccurate personal commentary on the virus, which risk further undermining public trust in his leadership at a moment of national emergency.  And with the virus spreading -- to more than 150 US cases with 11 deaths in 13 states -- there is a strong sense that the White House is now facing only a fraction of the challenge that may soon hit.  Pence is trying to keep American life and commerce moving while delivering hints that the administration is prepared should things could get worse and more stringent mitigation measures might be needed.  He touted a "busy and productive" day at the White House as he appeared for a televised briefing, stressing that the risk to Americans of contracting the coronavirus "remains low."  Trump met airline executives at the White House and assured Americans it was safe to fly in his latest apparent effort to limit the damage to the economy from the spread of the virus.  "At this moment we think we have it very much in hand," the President said. His optimism hardly reflected the true state of affairs in the industry. United Airlines, for instance, said it would cut domestic flights by 10% and international ones by 20%.  Pence vows to fix the testing backlog  JUST WATCHED Pence: More coronavirus deaths in US 'possible' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pence: More coronavirus deaths in US 'possible' 03:40  Pence was criticized by Democrats when he was named last week as the head of Trump's task force, not least for his performance in dealing with an HIV epidemic when he was governor of Indiana.  But in his first week on the job, and apart from his ritual and repeated praise of Trump, he has done less to politicize the White House response than his boss.  In a briefing on Wednesday, he vowed to deal with complaints from health care providers and state and local authorities that they lack sufficient testing capacity to check the virus's spread.  He said 1.5 million testing kits were on their way to health care providers and university labs and other locations. And he assured Americans that the administration had acted to make tests available for free on private health plans, Medicare and Medicaid.  Dr. Stephen Hahn, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, told reporters that by the end of the week capacity will be in place to perform 1 million tests.  Another member of Trump's task force, Deborah Birx, said new data from Italy and South Korea was prompting the government to take further steps to shield the most at-risk patients -- the elderly. She also noted that there was a very low risk of death for those under 30.  Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, announced directives for hospitals on triaging patients with coronavirus symptoms, offering information for nursing homes about limiting visitors and monitoring staff and mandating new procedures on oversight of nursing homes.  Pence will head to Washington state on Thursday to the US epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and he plans to hold a meeting with the cruise ship industry on Saturday. The announcement came as it emerged that a vessel, the Grand Princess, is off the coast of San Francisco with a number of passengers and crew members complaining of coronavirus symptoms. A small cluster of coronavirus cases were traced to the ship from a previous voyage, Princess Cruises said in a statement.  As the effort to ramp up the response widens, Congress reached agreement Wednesday to send the White House an $8.3 billion funding package, plugging a gap in the White House's earlier unpreparedness following an initial request that was about a quarter of that size.  Pence admits 'mistakes'  The vice president briefed lawmakers on the government's response to the virus on Wednesday.  Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island said the vice president admitted in a meeting with House Democrats to "some mistakes made early in the process" related to testing.  Speaking on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront," Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, who is from a district where the virus has been discovered, also praised Pence.  "I am glad Vice President Pence was there to say 'I am taking control,' surrounded by scientists and health care officials -- that's what you are supposed to do," he said.  But Correa had harsher words for Trump, suggesting that he was falling short of the standards of leadership expected from a President in a time of crisis.  "Don't blame Obama. Don't say it's a Democratic hoax. Address it and call it for what it is -- this is the new norm in the United States," he added.  Trump's tendency to muddle the message and exploit every situation for personal political gain reared its head yet again on Wednesday when he blamed his predecessor for the tardy dispatch of testing kits.  "The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing," Trump said Wednesday during on a meeting addressing the coronavirus outbreak.  "And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more rapid and accurate fashion," the President said, characteristically looking for someone else to blame when his leadership is criticized. Experts said his claim was false -- and a source close to the coronavirus task force told CNN's Jim Acosta it's not clear where Trump got his information.  In many ways, Trump is in an unusual position. His usual armory of political weapons -- disinformation, withering attacks on opponents and institutions that check his power, and a repeated habit of ignoring facts -- are useless in fighting an epidemic.  And as seesawing stock markets, reverberations in the worlds of international business and travel, and rising death and infection rates show, the White House remains deeply vulnerable to events it cannot control.
2020-03-05	Hong Kong (CNN) China is stepping up measures to prevent coronavirus cases being imported back from other virus-hit nations, as the outbreak slows within the country but picks up speed across the world.  The deadly virus has spread to more than 75 countries and territories worldwide since emerging from China late last year. The number of new daily cases reported outside China has now far exceeded the number of infections announced each day within the country.  Despite the decline of new cases, Chinese authorities are on high alert following an uptick of imported cases from overseas since last week.  Multiple cities and provinces -- including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong -- have announced a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from overseas, with the strictest restrictions placed on those coming from countries with severe outbreaks, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan.  China's effort to prevent imported cases comes amid rising nationalist pride that the country's sweeping measures to contain the outbreak -- and the self-sacrifice of the Chinese people -- offered other nations a crucial window to prepare for its spread. There is also growing criticism online against other governments for their allegedly slow response to control the outbreak. Both sentiments have been played up in state media.  Imported cases  So far, China has confirmed 20 imported cases, mostly expatriate Chinese who returned to their hometowns as the outbreak flared up in their host countries.  By the end of Tuesday, 6,728 overseas passengers had arrived in China showing symptoms of infection, according to the General Administration of Customs . Among them 779 were suspected coronavirus cases and 75 showed positive results from initial nucleic acid tests, the administration said in a statement on its website.  Some local governments in China have urged overseas Chinese to reconsider their homecoming plans for the sake of their "family's health and safety."  Zhejiang, an affluent province on the country's east coast with a large number of emigrants, reported seven new imported cases Tuesday.  According to local authorities, all of them are Chinese nationals returning from Italy, which is facing the biggest outbreak in Europe with 3,089 confirmed cases and 107 deaths as of Thursday.  The seven people, who worked and lived in the northern Italian town of Bergamo, returned to their hometown of Qingtian county via Shanghai last week. They tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, according to the Qingtian government.  None of them had been to Hubei province or its capital Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged, the government said.  The seven returnees all had close contact with a woman confirmed to have the virus on Sunday. The woman, surnamed Wang, was the first imported case of Zhejiang province. The eight worked together at the same restaurant in Bergamo, an hour's drive from Milan, the Qingtian government said in a statement on its social media account.  Tourist wearing a protective respiratory mask tours outside the Colosseo monument in downtown Rome on February 28.  According to the Qingtian government, Wang began coughing on February 16. She boarded a flight in Milan on February 26 and landed in Shanghai via Moscow. Six of the imported cases took the same flight as her, and the other one left Italy two days later via Germany.  "What we're trying to isolate is the virus, but what cannot be severed are the bonds of flesh and blood between overseas Chinese and their families in their hometowns," the Qingtian government said.  "For the sake of your family's health and safety, please strengthen your precautions and prudently decide on your travel plans to minimize mobility," it added.  Qingtian, named after its green rice paddies, is known for its large number of overseas immigrants. Around 300,000 people from the county live overseas, including 100,000 in Italy, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.  On Thursday, Zhejiang provincial health authorities reported another two imported cases in the city of Huzhou, both returnees from Italy.  Self-quarantine for overseas travelers  When the outbreak started to flare in late January, the Chinese government was critical of countries -- especially the United States -- for placing travel restrictions on China.  From late January to early February, the Chinese foreign ministry repeatedly lashed out at the US for its response to the outbreak, accusing it of "going in the opposite way" of the World Health Organization's advice against travel restrictions on China, saying it was "certainly not a gesture of goodwill."  As the outbreak spiraled into a full public health crisis, an increasing number of countries and regions moved to shun Chinese visitors.  But the tables seem to be turning. As the number of new infected cases shoot up abroad, the increase of confirmed cases in China has slowed steadily -- a development that spurred some Chinese nationalists into pride and indignation.  "Now, we should rightfully declare that the US owes China an apology, the world owes China a thank you," reads a social media article carried on Xinhua's website, which criticized the US for its slow response to contain the virus within its own borders.  So far, China has not imposed travel restrictions on these countries, despite the rapidly worsening situations in Iran, Italy and South Korea. But multiple local authorities have dialed up quarantine efforts for overseas arrivals.  The financial hub of Shanghai, where the eight Qingtian returnees landed, announced Tuesday that it will require all people, regardless of nationality, to go into quarantine for 14 days if they have arrived from a "key country or region" with serious outbreak conditions.  Similar measures have also been adopted in Beijing, the southern province of Guangdong and the cities of Qingdao and Weihai in eastern Shandong province.  Shandong is just an hour's flight from South Korea, which has the most confirmed cases outside China. As of Wednesday, South Korea reported 5,766 confirmed cases and 35 deaths.  Last week, Zhong Nanshan, a government-appointed respiratory expert, already warned at a press conference in Guangzhou that with the rapid spread of the virus abroad, China could "go from exporting infected cases to importing cases."  He was soon proved right.  On Saturday, Beijing reported two imported cases who had returned from Iran, another badly hit country where 92 people have been killed by the virus, including an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and one of the country's top clerics.  Both cases had close contact with a translator who returned from Iran to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China. The 23-year-old man was confirmed to have the virus on February 26, according to local authorities , and is believed to be the first imported case reported.  Members of the medical team spray disinfectant to sanitize outdoor place of Imam Reza's holy shrine in Mashhad, Iran on February 27.  'We're under huge pressure'  In Beijing, the municipal government announced at a pres conference Wednesday that anyone arriving in the capital from South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan must undergo a 14-day quarantine at home or at a designated hotel.  Chen Bei, a municipal government official, said some overseas Chinese students and workers were eager to return home as the outbreak spreads quickly in other countries. "In recent days, more than 20 Chinese students have returned from Iran via Beijing," she was quoted by Xinhua as saying.  "As one of the most important port of entries in the country, we're under huge pressure to prevent the outbreak from being imported (back in China)," she added.  As one of the most important port of entries in the country, we're under huge pressure to prevent the outbreak from being imported (back in China) Chen Bei, a Beijing official  Since February 14, Beijing had ordered everyone who returned to the capital to go into self-quarantine for two weeks. The rules were slightly loosened a week later, exempting overseas travelers and some other groups from self-quarantine.  But some residential communities have already been carrying out quarantines for residents returning from virus-hit countries before the announcement on Tuesday.  Bill Birtles, a Beijing-based correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was visited by a building manager after he returned from South Korea for a reporting trip last week. A notice was later affixed to the outside of his apartment door.  The notice, written in Chinese, informs his neighbors that the occupant of this apartment has recently returned from South Korea and is now in self-quarantine.  "For everyone's physical and psychological health, me and my family are now staying home for medical observation until March 10," the notice reads. "Thank you for your understanding and support."  Birtles told CNN that he also been required to sign a statement agreeing to the quarantine, and report his daily temperature readings in a WeChat group set up by the property management company for the about a dozen residents quarantined at home in the building.
2020-03-05	Hong Kong/London (CNN Business) Global markets slumped again on Friday, tracking heavy losses on Wall Street and staging a repeat of last week's bloodbath on growing signs that the novel coronavirus outbreak will lead to a sharp economic downturn.  About $9 trillion has been wiped off global stocks in nine days, Bank of America said in a research note after US markets closed deep in the red again on Thursday.  As Asian and European markets fell Friday, so did US stock futures. Dow futures were last down 580 points or 2.2%. S&P 500 andfutures fell more than2% each.  And the rate of infection continues to climb in the United States and the United Kingdom. Wild market swings over the past few days indicate how nervous investors are about the unfolding outbreak. There are now nearly 98,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide , and almost 3,400 deaths. South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran have become hotspots, recording the most cases outside of mainland China.And the rate of infection continues to climb in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Oil prices extended their downward slide, despite plans unveiled Thursday by OPEC to slash the supply of crude oil to world markets by 1.5 million barrels a day, assuming the cartel's main ally Russia agrees at a meeting in Vienna on Friday. Those supply curbs would come on top of existing cuts of 2.1 million barrels per day as producers try to respond to a collapse in demand.  Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were down more than 4% at $47.80 a barrel.  Investors, meanwhile, are still plowing their money into safe haven assets as fear takes hold. Gold continued its upward march, adding to gains on Thursday to trade 1% higher at $1,688 an ounce. And the 10-year Treasury yield sank below 0.7%, a new all-time low. Yields on 10-year bonds in developed economies are at their lowest level in 120 years, according to Bank of America.  Dow INDU Friday's losses in Asia and Europe followed a nearly 1,000-point drop for theovernight. The steep declines came after the index recorded two 1,000-point gains and an 800-point loss earlier this week.  S&P 500 SPX The, meanwhile, fell 3.4% The benchmark is down 6.4% for the year.  "Markets have shifted from pricing temporary China weakness to a more protracted global event, which will see a good chunk of global GDP go up in smoke," wrote Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, in a Friday research note.  Recovery delayed  On Friday, S&P Global Ratings downgraded its economic outlook for Asia Pacific, saying the coronavirus could wipe $211 billion from household, corporate and government incomes and slow economic growth in the region to 4% for the year. The ratings agency had earlier forecast growth of 4.8%.  "Our U-shaped recovery has been pushed back to later in 2020 due to a harder hit to China's economy in the first quarter, viral transmission outside China, and tighter financial conditions," the S&P economists wrote, referring to a slower return to normal than the fast V-shaped recovery that some economists had hoped for last month  The ratings agency also forecast that China's economy will likely grow by just 4.8%, and said growth could slump even more if infections spike as people return to work and governments reintroduce restrictions on activity.  The growing global outbreak will deliver shocks to Japan and South Korea's domestic supply and demand, they said, adding that it will also result in weaker demand from the United States and Europe.  Some industries are expecting steep losses as the outbreak rages on.  Global airlines stand to lose $113 billion in sales if the coronavirus continues to spread, according to the latest assessment from the International Air Transport Association. Just two weeks ago, IATA had been expecting lost sales in the range of $30 billion.  Starbucks, meanwhile, said it expects a 50% decline in sales at stores in China during the January-March quarter.  — Laura He and Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.
2020-03-05	(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security refused entry into the US to 241 people within the past month because of the coronavirus, according to data provided by the department.  DHS denied entry to 14 people at airports and 227 at land ports.  The figures provided by DHS were recorded from February 2 to March 3. The department did not provide a country breakdown for those who were refused entry at the airports.  An additional 106 foreign nationals were denied entry before arriving in the US at preclearance airports, where US Customs officials conduct screening overseas.  The department is tasked with screening passengers that are subject to President Donald Trump's travel restrictions from China and Iran. At the beginning of February, the United States began implementing stringent travel restrictions in an effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Most foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival to the United States are denied entry. That was expanded to include Iran last week.  Read More

2020-03-06	(CNN) It's been a week of dizzying coronavirus developments in the United States, with fear growing as deaths skyrocketed within days from one to 14 people nationwide.  There are now 228 confirmed cases in the United States alone, and that may go up as testing becomes more accessible.  Here are the key things we've learned this week:  The number of affected states is growing  Washington state has the largest number at 70 confirmed cases, including 13 deaths. California has 49 infections, including one fatality. New York has 22 positive cases; Illinois has five; Texas and Florida both have four, and the remaining states have three or fewer cases.  In New York alone, more than 2,500 people have been ordered to self-quarantine as health officials search for anyone who may have been exposed to the virus.  A cruise ship with 3,500 people is in limbo at sea  The California Air National Guard dropped off test kits by helicopter Thursday after learning that the first person to die of the virus in the state previously traveled on the Grand Princess.  Medical officials collected samples for testing from 45 people aboard. The Grand Princess was on a two-week trip from San Francisco to Hawaii and was scheduled to return Saturday. The California man's death was the first fatality outside Washington state. He took a cruise from San Francisco to Mexico on the same ship last month.  The California National Guard drops virus testing kits down to the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California on Thursday.  A frantic search for answers at a nursing home  At a press conference outside the nursing home, some relatives said their loved ones died without knowing whether the virus was responsible. Pat Herrick -- who first expressed concerns to CNN on Tuesday about the situation at the nursing home -- says her mother, Elaine, died Thursday morning after living at Life Care Center for seven years.  Hundreds are denied entry into the US  Homeland Security denied US entry to 241 people because of the coronavirus. The figures were recorded within the past month, and did not include a country breakdown for those refused entry at the airports. An additional 106 foreigners were denied entry before arriving in the US at preclearance airports, where customs officials conduct screening overseas.  In February, the United States started implementing stringent travel restrictions to contain the outbreak  Congress approves billions to fight outbreak  The Senate approved a sweeping spending package to direct $8.3 billion toward the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The package now goes to the White House for the President's signature. It passed the House with broad, bipartisan support. It provides $7.8 billion in appropriations to address the outbreak of coronavirus as well as $500 million to fund a telehealth program to expand senior access to health services -- a total of $8.3 billion in all.  The US does not have enough testing kits  Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the outbreak, admitted the available testing kits are not enough to meet demand after new guidance made testing accessible to patients with only a doctor's order.  Experts have questioned whether the United States can meet the likely surge in testing demand that will follow the change in guidelines.  Between CDC tests and those from a private company, IDT, there will be a nationwide capacity to test 475,000 people by the end of the week, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said. He said he hopes IDT will ramp up production of kits to be able to test about a million and a half people by the end of next week.  Global experts warn this is 'not a drill'  The World Health Organization is warning governments that the global spread of the coronavirus is "not a drill" and will require significant steps to contain.
2020-03-06	Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji are co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI). The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.  Fearing the US economy would fall into a recession due to the coronavirus, the Fed pushed through an emergency rate cut for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet, our research shows that the US economy came into this epidemic in more resilient cyclical shape than the Fed -- and most economists -- realize. This rate cut could do more harm than good.  What they may not appreciate is that an economy isn't always susceptible to shocks. Rather, it needs to be in a cyclical "window of vulnerability" for a negative shock to tip it into recession.  Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in the summer of 2005 and also caused significant damage to the regional and national economy. But it didn't trigger a US recession. Nor did Japan's December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which occurred before ramped-up wartime spending boosted the economy. The reason was that -- as indicated by reliable leading indexes we've long monitored -- the US economy was not in a recessionary window of vulnerability on either of those occasions and could therefore weather those shocks.  Going into the coronavirus crisis, the dozen-plus key leading indexes we monitor told us that the US economy wasn't in a window of vulnerability. Therefore, the shock of the epidemic hitting US shores wasn't going to tip the economy into a recession.  Importantly, housing -- a critical driver of the economy -- had already been strengthening , partly because mortgage rates were already near record lows before the rate cut. We didn't need even lower mortgage rates, which followed the rate cut, to shore it up.

She is the author of " Keep Marching: How Every Woman Can Take Action and Change Our World. " The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) I live in Kirkland, Washington, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in our nation. As of Friday, 11 people have died in or near Kirkland and we still don't know the full breadth of the threat or the response needed due to the botched testing rollout and lack of resources.  Many people I care about are sick but none know if it's coronavirus or something more typical. I'm sad, scared and worried. Worried about my kids, worried about my family, my own health, and my community. And I'm mad -- deep in my cells angry. Just days ago at a rally, President Donald Trump said : "This is their [Democrats] new hoax," unhelpfully politicizing a public health crisis that is endangering Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and people of all parties alike.  This is no hoax. We need help.  People in Kirkland have been trying to prepare as much as possible on their own, while also trying not to over purchase at stores so neighbors have supplies too. Listening to advice from public health experts, many have been stocking up on two weeks of food and supplies. And now there isn't an antibacterial wipe or bottle of Purell to be found in local stores (experts say washing your hands with soap and water for the full "Happy Birthday" song twice -- or 20 seconds -- is effective). In many stores, stocks are low for non-perishable goods too, even toilet paper, and last I looked dried black beans were often also back ordered in top online stories.  But we can't solve this on our own with cabinets full of non-perishable goods. Medical resources, including testing kits, and smart public health policies, including access to paid sick days, are urgently overdo.  As the death toll climbs here, few people in Kirkland know whether they should go to work or not if they have even a runny nose or sore throat. While the testing criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now say anyone in the United States can get a test if their doctor orders one, here in Kirkland, and in the King County area including Seattle, testing for the coronavirus isn't currently available unless you've traveled outside the United States to a select group of specific countries or been in direct contact with someone who has tested positive.  To confirm this, because news reports and statements from politicians have varied, I called the King County Department of Public Health coronavirus line Thursday evening, sat on hold for 35 minutes and spoke with someone who told me they still don't have tests available outside that narrow criteria and don't know when they will have them.  on Monday, the All of this is in contrast to what we're hearing from the federal government:on Monday, the FDA stepped forward to say it would orchestrate the production of one million coronavirus tests by this Friday, working with public and private ventures; the possibility of this feat happening was immediately questioned by experts. And, while on Tuesday Vice President Mike Pence said , "Any American can be tested" for coronavirus, local doctors here in Kirkland say tests are not yet available.  Of course, it's hard to take any of the promises that Trump or Pence make relating to the coronavirus and public health seriously at this point when no significant increase in tests are to be found here at the center of the epidemic, when Trump has called the coronavirus outbreak a "hoax," when Trump has rolled back public health programs , and when he has also demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the coronavirus vaccine process and timeline despite being corrected by public health experts numerous times.  Facing this extreme inaction by the federal government, Washington state is now working to implement commercial tests, but as of Wednesday there wasn't a timeline on when those tests would be available or how many.  Even with the testing criteria, the Trump administration created a botched system that for too long caused a backlog because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day in our entire country. Contrast that to South Korea where people can get a drive-up test  For our nation as a whole, and for Kirkland in particular, the current narrow testing criteria and resources are wholly insufficient: research is showing that the coronavirus has likely been spreading undetected in our community for up to six weeks, meaning many people here likely have the illness -- including in its mild form -- and just haven't been able to be tested yet, so have been inadvertently spreading it farther as they go about their daily lives. To be clear, people here are rightly concerned and needing to be tested even if they haven't been in the Life Care Center in Kirkland, where the majority of fatalities have occurred , because "community transmission," which is when cases arise in the community without a specific source, is beyond the doors of that particular facility here. In fact scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle estimate the number of people who are getting the virus here is quickly doubling every six days. But despite this community transmission, there is not yet any community testing.  We have a true crisis in the United States. Everyone gets sick in normal times, so without testing no one can say for sure what they have: coronavirus that should result in their being quarantined to protect our neighbors and the rest of our nation, or a normal winter cold or illness.  In this pressure cooker of stress, there is also pressure to go to work. While in Washington State most workers can accrue paid sick days , tens of millions of people, including the majority of low wage workers across the nation cannot. To follow doctor's orders and stay home when sick, or to be quarantined when the coronavirus strikes, or to be there when a child's school is closed due to the outbreak, everyone needs access to paid sick days. And when facing a choice between paying rent and taking an unpaid day off, most people who are struggling to make ends meet have little choice but to work sick.  The National Partnership for Women & Families recently highlighted the dire situation: more than a quarter of private sector workers, and 70% of low wage workers, don't have access to a single paid sick day in our nation, with Latinx and black workers put at the most risk. Hidden in these statistics is the fact that the majority of food service and childcare workers can't even earn paid sick days. And that adds up to more than 32 million working people in the United States who don't have a single paid sick day available to put to use, even to follow public health experts' orders in a coronavirus outbreak.  We've long had a slow, silent moving national emergency when it comes to any virus. It's irresponsible to deny access to paid sick days this year or any year. Congress must pass the Healthy Families Act , which guarantees seven paid sick days to workers at businesses with 15 or more employees and seven job-protected unpaid sick days for workers in smaller businesses. It's also fiscally irresponsible not to pass this policy. Studies show that a lack of paid sick days causes "presenteeism," which means there is lost productivity and increased spread of illness in the workplace because people have to work sick, costing our national economy an estimated $160 billion annually, or about $234 billion when adjusted for inflation. President Trump must sign it into law immediately so we can protect our families, economy and country.  Want proof that passing paid sick days helps? According to a 2017 report, during a flu wave, there was up to a 40% drop in flu rates in cities and states that have passed paid sick days . Over 40 US locations -- cities, counties and states -- have already passed paid sick days, so the momentum exists to pass a federal paid sick day policy in Congress because access to earned sick days shouldn't depend on your zip code. Illness doesn't hesitate to cross from one zip code to another.  To address a critical crisis and to keep our economy moving into the future, we urgently need not only paid sick days, but also full access to affordable health care and childcare, and paid family/medical leave in our nation. We need federal funds quickly moved to support testing, scientists, medical professionals, states, localities, businesses and families in the fight against the coronavirus. And the Trump administration not only needs to fix the coronavirus testing protocol rapidly (and not just say they are fixing it) and push the CDC to release data so public health experts can take appropriate action, they also need to work with Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act.  It's time, Mr. President, to take the coronavirus seriously before even more American lives are sacrificed to the delusion that this will just go away.

2020-03-06	(CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that he was "confident" that the United States would handle the novel coronavirus "better than any nation in the world" as the Trump administration has been under scrutiny for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak.  Pompeo voiced the optimism during an interview with CNBC, in response to a question about whether the US could have as successful a response as China without imposing on people's civil liberties. China imposed severe restrictions on travel in an effort to contain the virus.  "I'm confident we can handle it here. I'm confident we'll handle it better than any nation in the world," Pompeo said.  Late last month, the White House assembled a coronavirus task force, with Vice President Mike Pence at the helm.  Pompeo seemed to blame the Chinese government for the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which was discovered late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and putting the US "behind the curve."  "Remember this is the Wuhan coronavirus that's caused this and the information that we got on the front end of this thing wasn't perfect and has led us now to a place where much of the challenge we face today has put us behind the curve," Pompeo said on CNBC.  Pompeo said it "has proven incredibly frustrating to work with the Chinese Communist Party to get our hands around the data set, which will ultimately be the solution to both getting the vaccine and attacking this risk."  He did acknowledge he was "happy" with the efforts China had taken to slow the spread of the virus.  Pompeo has specifically used the phrase "Wuhan coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus" when discussing the illness in recent days, despite the fact that it was officially named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 or coronavirus disease in February.  "Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks," Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Director General, said at the time. Pompeo's comments were aimed at countering disinformation from the Chinese government about the origin of the virus, a State Department official said. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said this week they were still tracing the origin of COVID-19, although the first confirmed cases were found in Wuhan.  "No less authority than the Chinese Communist Party said it came from Wuhan," Pompeo said Friday. "We have pretty high confidence that we know where this began, and we have high confidence too that there was information that could have been made available more quickly and data that could have been provided and shared among health professionals across the world."  Pompeo downplayed anecdotes about the US government mishandling its coronavirus response, saying on CNBC that he "would urge everyone not to rely on anecdote stories that one hears about a particular instance but look at the actions that we're taking."  "This response has been serious, robust and it will continue to be," he said.  Pompeo deferred on questions about the shortage of testing kits, saying he wasn't involved directly. Pence acknowledged Thursday that there were not enough kits to meet demand.  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has grown to over 200 across 19 states, including 12 deaths.
2020-03-06	(CNN) A political storm over confusion and delays in coronavirus testing will only intensify after President Donald Trump canceled a trip to the agency responsible for problems hampering a full accounting of the disease's spread into 21 states and then decided to go after all.  Early Friday morning, the White House announced Trump would no longer visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later in the day, saying he didn't want to distract from the CDC's work. But as he signed a $8.3 billion coronavirus response bill , the President said he "may go" after he said an individual who was thought to have the virus tested negative. Later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham confirmed that Trump was indeed going after all.  The mixed signals coincide with growing scrutiny of the administration's failure to get millions of virus testing kits quickly out to the states.  A fault with an early batch of CDC testing kits limited testing capacity from the start and officials in states and cities are sounding the alarm that they lack the capacity for mass diagnosis as the virus spreads, even as the White House strives to ratchet up production of new tests.  The issue of test kits, along with a building crisis in the travel industry is becoming the focus of widening political pressure on the White House and is contradicting Trump's glowing new self assessments of a seamless virus management effort. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway added to the administration's self-congratulations when she told reporters Friday morning that "this has been contained" despite reports to the contrary from other administration officials and health experts.  The threat, however, deepens by the day. There are now at least 234 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US, including three just outside Washington, in Maryland's Montgomery County . Fourteen people have died and 21 states have recorded cases amid a nationwide health alert.  In the most significant development on Thursday, new problems emerged in the administration's effort to rush testing kits to health care providers and state and local political leaders expressed growing frustration about the situation in their constituencies.  Vice President Mike Pence bluntly replied to questions about the availability of testing kits in comments that raised the prospect that the administration is poorly prepared if the outbreak turns into a major US epidemic.  "We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward," Pence admitted to reporters.  The vice president's comment reflected the candor he has shown in leading the coronavirus task force , which is unusual for this administration and has won him plaudits among some Democrats on Capitol Hill.  While he did say the government currently can test "those that we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms," his remarks raised questions about his previous promise that "any American can be tested."  In a CNN town hall on Thursday night, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said testing needs to be "much more proactive" to get a fuller picture of the coronavirus.  "For that reason, we're going to need millions and millions and millions of tests," Fauci said. "That's what I feel and that's what many of my colleagues feel."  'An embarrassment for the United States'  Some officials and health care providers are warning that the lack of testing capacity is not just a future problem, it also is hampering attempts to get a fix on the disease right now.  "This is becoming an embarrassment for the United States of America," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN's "The Situation Room," complaining that he had been pleading with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since late January for proper testing capacity.  "There's something wrong here that the federal government is missing and they must fix it," de Blasio said, adding that testing had allowed officials to clear 26 New Yorkers, in addition to confirming four cases in the city. "The fact that the federal government cannot get tests out there is extraordinarily problematic."  Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who represents Washington, the worst-hit state, expressed extreme frustration that the administration apparently had failed to use a six-week lead time when the disease broke out in China to get tests ready.  Murray said that "mixed messages, the chaotic back and forth" and a lack of testing capability in their home state had forced thousands of people in her state to stay home.  "This confusion, this lack of testing, is causing real confusion and chaos, and it's dangerous," Murray said, adding that she had not had a reply from Pence to a letter in which she had asked him to explain the situation.  "The way we replace fear is by having real concrete information. Without the tests that are credible, we don't have that, and therefore we don't know -- and community leaders and school districts and businesses don't know -- how to make the wisest decisions," Murray told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront."  Uncertainty over administration's testing targets  The exact numbers of testing kits that are going out to providers in the short term remains unclear.  The White House previously raised expectations for a million tests being available by the end of this week. But on Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said capacity would be in place to test 475,000 people in that time frame.  Pence's spokeswoman Katie Miller insisted that the administration is "not missing" its goal of a million tests being distributed by the end of the week.

MUST WATCH Dr. Gupta: U.S. doesn't have 'clear vision' on coronavirus spread 04:07  The effort to guarantee countrywide testing was slowed in the first instance by a fault with laboratory tests. House Democrats have announced an investigation into that failure in an effort to establish whether it might have made it more difficult for officials to assess the disease's spread across the US.  Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said that even when public health authorities get the test kits it will take a few days for people to be trained to use them.  "It's really important ... that the administration develop a timeline so the health care community, our doctors, our clinics, our hospitals and the public know when there will be more testing available and where," Hassan said on "CNN Right Now."  The low-level testing in the US is hampering efforts to trace the genuine extent of infections.  Dr. Seema Yasmin, a former CDC disease detective, said on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that 140,000 people had been tested for the disease so far in South Korea. By comparison, CDC figures cited by CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, had the total number of US tests so far at around 1,500.  Travel industry sounds alarm  Another developing nightmare for the White House is growing fears that the travel industry -- an important driver of the economy -- could face a catastrophic blow as conferences are canceled and families mull whether to hold off on vacation plans.

Trump met airline executives at the White House on Wednesday and they asked him not to publicly discourage Americans from taking planes since their business were at risk, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN's Kevin Liptak.  The plea by the CEOs points to the difficult challenge the administration faces. It wants to keep America moving, to shield the economy from damage and to keep life as normal as possible.  But it also has a duty to tell the American people the truth at a time of an emergency. And it must must weigh every word that could cause a stock market slump or have devastating commercial reverberations.  Things look certain to get worse since the International Air Transport Association warned that global airlines could lose $113 billion in sales if the virus continues to spread.  The cruise industry is also taking a severe hit as one ship, the Grand Princess, idles off the coast of California because it had carried a passenger who later died from the disease.  Testing kits were delivered by helicopter to the vessel on Thursday and results on passengers who suffered flu-like symptoms during its voyage will be back on Friday.  In a sign of more deepening anxiety over the crisis, stock markets took a fresh pounding on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly another 1,000 points.  Trump touts out-of-date poll numbers  Despite all the grim news, Trump is continuing to downplay the sense of crisis, in a way that contrasts with Pence's reliance on scientific and government experts.  "With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!" the President tweeted , before the numbers rose later in the day.  On Thursday, in a Fox News town hall in Pennsylvania, he boasted about poll numbers related to his management of the crisis that are now three weeks old.  "We've gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of a thing," Trump said. "We were given tremendous marks -- you look at Gallup polls, you look at other polls."  Earlier in the day, the President was fuming about a backlash to his remarks of a day before that had appeared to indicate he was relaxed about people with the virus going to work. In a phone call with Sean Hannity on Fox News , he also suggested that World Health Organization estimates of the death rate for the coronavirus of 3.4% were wrong. "I think the 3.4% is really a false number," Trump said. "Now, this is just my hunch."  It is possible that when all the post-epidemic data is evaluated the death rate will be below the WHO estimate.  But it was another example of Trump speaking imprecisely at best, misleadingly at worst and offering disinformation about a crisis that could have profound reverberations for him in his reelection year if it causes a major economic downturn.  This story has been updated to reflect new developments and reaction.
2020-03-06	Hong Kong (CNN) Members of the Shincheonji religious group dress in identical white shirts, black pants and name tags when they gather to hear founder Lee Man-hee preach.  There are no chairs, except for those provided for the elderly or sick. They sit on the floor to listen to sermons to maximize space.  The religious practices of Shincheonji are in the public eye because the movement appears to be the source of South Korea's growing novel coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 5,000 people there.  Shincheonji, however, is not the only fringe faith in the country. Today there are hundreds of similar minority religious groups in South Korea -- including Christian ones -- according to Tark Ji-il, a professor at Busan Presbyterian University and a respected expert on the country's religious movements.  Some of their leaders claim to be prophets or argue they alone have an unmatched ability to interpret the Bible. A few are notorious for calling on worshipers to do things that look, to the outside world, strange at best and abusive or violent at worst  Though there is no accepted consensus as to why so many of these new religious movements proliferated in South Korea, many trace their roots back decades to Japan's colonization of South Korea and the military dictatorship that ruled the country when it gained independence after World War II in 1945.  Catholicism arrived on the Korean peninsula via China in the 18th century , and Protestant missionaries arrived in the 1880s to spread their faith. The turn of the 19th century brought profound change in Korea, when the Joseon dynasty collapsed in 1897 after 500 years of rule, and the peninsula was annexed by Japan 13 years later.  Many Koreans were pessimistic about the future during colonial rule, World War II and the Korean War. They lacked faith in their political leaders, and so looked to religious figures who promised them spiritual salvation, according to Tark.  Lee appears to have been one of them. The devout Christian was in his early twenties when he served in the South Korean Army's 7th Infantry Division during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. After the hostilities ceased, Lee became one of more than a million followers of a charismatic Presbyterian elder named Park Tae-son.  Park Tae-son is seen preaching in this photograph from 1957.  The vision on the mountain  As Park addressed his fellow Christians at the top of Nam-San mountain, he claimed to see visions of fire and water descending from the heavens.  It was April 1955. Park was one of several religious leaders speaking at a massive revival rally held at what is now the site of Seoul's iconic YTN Tower.  Born in present-day North Korea in 1915, Park had attended Presbyterian church services from a young age, according to James Grayson, an emeritus professor of modern Korean studies at the University of Sheffield. But until that point, he had practiced an "orthodox line of Presbyterianism," said Grayson, a Methodist presbyter who lived in South Korea from 1971 to 1987 and studied the country's culture and religions.  "He had not been a part of any new religious movement before," Grayson said.  A photo taken on September 7, 2015 shows a general view of the Nam-San mountain above central Seoul.  Park's vision led him to believe he had been spiritually cleansed and that his hands had been given "great power," Grayson wrote in his book "Korea -- A religious history." Park then stepped down from his lectern, and supposedly healed a man who had been crippled for 30 years by massaging him on the head.  It was a seminal moment for Park and new Christian religious movements in South Korea. The experience spurred him to establish his own movement, called the Olive Tree Church.  Though mystical forms of Christianity that combined biblical teachings and elements of Korean folk religion had existed before Park's visions on the mountain, none had ever had the same level of power and influence that Park's movement would come to have.  Olive Tree movement founder Park Tae-son at a rally in South Korea in the 1950s.  Olive Tree quickly became one of two new influential Christian religious movements in South Korea in the 1950s and 1960s.  The other was Moon Sun-myung's Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, better known as the Unification Church. Today it makes international headlines for its mass weddings, when thousands of young couples tie the knot at the same time, with some brides and grooms meeting their betrothed for the first time on their wedding day.  These sects and their unique practices were particularly appealing to South Koreans in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was an era of upheaval in South Korean society, which was in the process of transforming from a poor, agrarian economy torn apart by a devastating civil war to one of the world's most modern and developed economies -- all in a single generation.  The economic leap, often called "the Miracle on the Han River," was spurred by the growth-minded military government of Park Chung-hee, which invested heavily in industrialization and infrastructure -- most of Korea's natural resources were located in the communist North.  From 1964 to 1995, per capita gross national income in Korea rose from $100 to $11,432, but the economic gains were not all shared equally. Those who did not reap the benefits of the Park government's moves "were disappointed by government policy after the Korean War," said David Kim, a professor at Australian National University and expert in Korean religion.  Many, Kim said, sought "internal peace" and these Christian sects filled the void.  A modern-day Zion  Park's Olive Tree religious group was a particularly attractive option for many Christians in South Korea. Its mission to establish a modern-day Zion appealed to many who felt left behind in the transition from an agrarian to an industrial society.  Park's faith healings, which he continued to conduct after his experience on the mountain, brought in many seeking spiritual, mental or physical rehabilitation -- including "ordinary people" who had little or no knowledge of Park's unique theology or teachings, said Kim.  People were drawn to the movement's wide-smiled leader with jet-black hair. Some even moved to a self-sufficient town built by Olive Tree, comprised of schools, factories and apartment complexes near Seoul.  Olive Tree church founder Park Tae-son is seen an undated photograph.  At its height, the Olive Tree movement had about 2 million members, according to Massimo Introvigne, a religious scholar and the founder of the Italy-based Center for Studies on New Religions . People joined in droves despite Park's growing list of controversies, including a brief stint in jail for embezzlement, said Introvigne, who in the past has defended new religious groups accused of wrongdoing.  The popularity, however, didn't last. Park eventually wore out his welcome with his parish when he claimed, according to Introvigne, that Jesus was an imposter and that he was the real Christ. His boast led to a string of mass defections in the mid-1960s. By the time he died in 1990, membership had plummeted.  Many of the white churches with crimson crosses across rural South Korea that once belonged to Olive Tree are now abandoned, "often used as village store-houses but no longer as places of worship," said Grayson.  One of those who left the Olive Tree religious movement was a Korean war veteran in his mid-thirties who had spent 10 years worshiping there.  His name was Lee Man-hee.  After quitting Park's parish, Lee jointly establish the Tabernacle Temple in the 1970s, but abandoned that group, too, after accusing his co-founders of corruption, according to Introvigne. Introvigne's account is based on two interviews with Lee, who is very private and rarely speaks with media. Lee declined to speak to CNN for this and other stories, though he held a rare news conference Monday to discuss the coronavirus and defend his religious group.  It would take a few more years, but on on March 14, 1984, Lee finally founded his own temple -- the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, often referred to just as Shincheonji.  Lee Man-hee, leader of the Shincheonji Church speaks during a news conference Monday in Gapyeong, South Korea.  A similar script  Shincheonji's origin story is dramatic, but it's not particularly unique.  Experts say most Christian sects in South Korea followed a similar script. They formed as splinter groups from the Olive Tree movement or the Unification Church. Most still lean heavily on the vivid apocalyptic symbolism in the book of Revelations and are led by figures that claim a sort of divine right. Others, like Lee, hint at spiritual superiority via a connection to God or Jesus.  Grayson, the emeritus professor at the University of Sheffield, said that other Christians in South Korea view groups that question the authority of Christ as heretical. Fundamentalist protestants, a powerful political force in South Korea, are particularly distrustful of fringe Christian sects -- especially Shincheonji, which has been accused of poaching members of other churches.  While there may be hundreds of these fringe groups, experts say they are a product of South Korea's unique socioeconomic and political history, not necessarily representative of Christianity or religion as a whole in Korea.  As of the South Korean government's 2015 census , only 44% of the country's citizens said they had a religion. Of those, 45% identified Protestant and 18% as Catholic.  Kim, the professor at Australia National University, believes Christian sects are viewed as suspicious by many South Koreans due to their "extreme evangelism."  "Ordinary Koreans would not know the existence of those minor Christian sects unless they have a personal connection through the relationship of family, friends or colleagues," he said.  "These groups constitute a rather small number of people," said Grayson. "But because of their nature (they) attract a lot of media attention."
2020-03-06	Three new cases of coronavirus have been reported in Colorado.  Authorities in Douglas County report two additional cases in their county. The first case is an adult who returned from a trip to Italy. The second is a student who returned from a trip to the Philippines.  The Eagle County Public Health Department announced their first presumptive positive case. The patient is a woman in her 50s visiting the area and likely exposed during international travel. She is not hospitalized and is recovering in isolation.  This is the eighth case of a positive or presumptive positive in Colorado.
2020-03-06	Hong Kong (CNN) The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned governments that the continued international spread of the novel coronavirus is "not a drill" and will require significant action if public health authorities are to contain the deadly outbreak.  The call to action comes as the global number of people infected by the virus nears 100,000 -- a grim milestone that now appears inevitable with self-sustaining clusters continuing to expand in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.  WHO chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that although public health authorities across the globe have the ability to successfully combat the spread of the virus, the organization is concerned that in some countries the level of political commitment does not match the threat level.  "This is not a drill. This is not the time to give up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops. Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans," Tedros said. "This epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages tche entire machinery of government."  The virus has spread to more than 80 countries and territories since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. Health experts have suggested that newly emergent clusters in Europe and the Middle East could accelerate the global spread of the disease. India has so far identified 31 cases, at least 17 of which have been linked to travelers from Italy, leading to fears that the world's second most populous country could see its own outbreak in the coming days. Cases linked to Iran have also emerged elsewhere in the world.  Tedros said Wednesday that all governments "should be preparing for sustained community transmission."  "Our message to all countries is: This is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country," he said.  Tedros' comments come amid mounting criticism of apparent disparities in testing and the response of authorities worldwide. In Japan , there is growing anxiety that the number of coronavirus cases could be significantly higher than reported, with experts questioning the country's approach to testing as infection rates continue to climb.  The Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, however, only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4, according to the country's Health Ministry.  In neighboring South Korea, infections have surged dramatically, with more than 6,500 confirmed cases after the government tested tens of thousands of people as part of a mass screening drive aimed at better mapping and controlling the virus' spread.  To date, over 97,850 infections have been confirmed worldwide, and more than 3,300 people have been killed by the virus, according to CNN's tally.  The majority of virus-related cases are in China, though the rate of new infections and fatalities there has slowed. The country's National Health Commission (NHC) reported that as of the end of the day Thursday, 3,042 people had died after contracting the virus and 80,552 cases had been confirmed. More than 53,700 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, per the NHC.  All 126 new confirmed cases in Hubei province announced on Friday were from the city of Wuhan, according to the Hubei Health Commission. Seventeen new cases were announced outside the province on Friday by the NHC.  JUST WATCHED How China's only Costco stays safe amid coronavirus fears Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How China's only Costco stays safe amid coronavirus fears 02:41  Numbers grow in the US  As the number of cases and deaths from novel coronavirus increase across the United States , federal health officials are working to expand testing for the fast-moving outbreak.  Still, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the outbreak, acknowledged Thursday there was a shortfall in the number of testing kits required to meet demand.  By Thursday afternoon, there were at least 228 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States -- with 70 in Washington state alone -- according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as state and local governments.  The hardest-hit area has been the city of Kirkland in Washington state, where the virus infected several people in a nursing home. Thirteen of the 14 people killed by the virus in the US were in Washington.  The other coronavirus death was reported Wednesday in California. The victim, an unidentified 71-year-old man, was a former passenger on the Grand Princess cruise ship who died almost two weeks after he returned home.  The aviation industry's 'gut punch'  The virus has had a dramatic effect on the global economy, with markets worldwide suffering losses. The Dow Jones closed down 970 points, or 3.6%, marking its fifth-worst single-day point drop on record. The index was down nearly 1,148 points at its lowest point.  This roller coaster of a week saw the Dow post two of its best days in history in terms of points gained on Monday and Wednesday, and one of its worst point losses Tuesday.

Travel and leisure companies are being hit hard. One executive in the aviation industry called the virus a "gut punch."  "This isn't economic in the sense that people want to travel but they can't afford to," said Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines. "We could discount prices tomorrow and it wouldn't do any good."  International carriers are taking a similar hit . The outbreak could cost the airline industry as much as $113 billion in lost revenue, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  "January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January," Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's Director General and CEO, said in a statement, referring to the formal name given to the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  While there were no predictions about how long the aviation world will be impacted, Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden said the "booking softness" is linked to substantial passenger "anxiety" -- a phenomenon the airline trade association in the US said may not be grounded in the actual risks to passengers.  "We're getting to the point where the reaction to the virus may be worse than the virus itself," said Nicholas Calio of Airlines for America.
2020-03-06	(CNN) When Episcopal congregants receive Holy Communion this weekend, many of them may choose not to dip the consecrated bread into the single, shared chalice. Some Catholic churches simply won't be using the cup during communion. And when worshippers of both traditions exchange the sign of peace, they'll wave or bump elbows instead of the typical handshakes or hugs.  Those are just a handful of the precautions that the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago are each taking to help prevent the spread of coronavirus in their congregations. Both institutions have issued guidelines to clergy, priests and other congregation leaders as more cases of coronavirus are identified across their region.  And as coronavirus continues to spread around the world, religious leaders across several faith traditions are modifying practices and adjusting services. Churches are offering mass online and on TV. Synagogues may stream readings of the Scroll of Esther for Purim. Muslim pilgrimages of Umrah are temporarily suspended.  Here's a look at some of the ways that religions are adapting to the threat of coronavirus.  Christianity  In Bethlehem, doors are closed at the Church of the Nativity, considered the birthplace of Jesus. And across Manger Square, the Omar Ben Khatab mosque stands empty as well.  The Church of the Nativity, regarded as the birthplace of Jesus, is closed over fears of coronavirus.  Instead of giving his weekly Sunday greeting at the window in St. Peter's Square in Rome, Pope Francis delivered the Angelus prayer via video link.  "We do this so that the close concentration of people won't spread the virus," the Pope said Sunday. He used his address to pray for those suffering from the outbreak and for those who are helping them.  The Pope appeared briefly at the window to bless a small number of people gathered in St. Peter's Square.  The Pope's weekly Wednesday audience will also be via video link, the Vatican said in a statement Saturday, and all public participation in his weekday private mass has been canceled through March 15.  Vatican City reported its first coronavirus case on Friday, and the Vatican dispelled reports that Pope Francis had been tested for coronavirus, saying he only had a cold. Meanwhile, churches in many cities in the north of Italy -- including Bologna, Turin, and Venice -- suspended their Ash Wednesday services, with some offering masses online or on local television.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has closed several temples and limited or temporarily suspended gatherings in Hong Kong, Mongolia, South Korea, Japan and Seattle.  The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s Office of Theology and Worship has assured worshippers that they can decide to limit church participation, or not, without fear of judgment. It also encouraged people who decide to stay home because they are sick to engage in other ways, including prayer circles, small groups and social media.  "I think it's a way to stave off a sense of panic or too much alarm," Jeffrey Lee, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese in Chicago, told CNN. "Knowing that there are things we can do is powerful for people in church or out of church."  Judaism  Next week is Purim, one of the most festive and joyous holidays of the year, often marked by feasts, parties and parades. Given the outbreak in some communities, Jewish leaders are making tough calls on whether they will be able to adjust some of the usual traditions -- or whether they'll have to scrap them altogether.  Other traditions are being affected too.  Jewish law requires that one hear a reading of the Scroll of Esther, or the Megillah, out loud on Purim. Synagogues that have either closed down due to the virus or have suspended large gatherings are now grappling with how their congregants can still fulfill that obligation.  The Rabinnical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis, has issued guidelines that suggest congregations could stream the reading.  It's an option that Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative synagogue in Seattle, is looking into, according to board president Norbert Sorg. The synagogue has canceled large gatherings for the time being, including Shabbat services on Friday nights and Saturday mornings.  Besides the reading, other Purim customs include gifting food to friends and neighbors and giving charity to those in need.  At Young Israel of New Rochelle, an Orthodox synagogue in a New York City suburb, it's tradition to go out and distribute cash to the poor, said Samuel Heilman, one of the synagogue's congregants. But that won't happen this year.  Young Israel of New Rochelle has been closed and several of its congregants are in quarantine after a member of the community tested positive for coronavirus.  The synagogue is closed after a member of the community tested positive for coronavirus. And several of its congregants, including Heilman and his wife Ellin Heilman, are under self-quarantine.  "Purim is pretty much going to be a washout this year," Heilman said.  Islam  Muslims at the Islamic Center of Southern California are asked not to embrace or kiss each other on the cheek, but rather place a hand over their hearts, give a respectful nod or flash a warm smile.  Members of the community have been advised to wash their hands often and keep their distance from others, and hand sanitizer stations have been installed for use as people enter and exit the mosque.  Workers clean the inside of Mecca's Grand Mosque on Thursday after Saudi Arabia emptied the holy site due to coronavirus fears.  California has seen at least 49 cases, and officials are warning that more are likely.  The Islamic Center of Southern California hasn't yet canceled services or urged people to pray at home. For now, they're waiting to see how the situation evolves. But it is something they're considering, according to spokesman Omar Ricci.  "We're just trying to stay ahead of things and I think a big part of this is messaging to the community," Ricci said. "If they see that the Islamic Center is on top of it and actively looking at things, I think that will give them a comfort level about us making some good choices. I think the important thing is that we don't overreact or underreact as things evolve."  Elsewhere in the world, communities are taking things a step further.  Saudi Arabia, which draws millions of faithful visitors each year, has temporarily suspended foreigners from coming to the kingdom for Umrah, a pilgrimage to visit Islam's holiest sites that can be taken at any time of the year.  Tajikstan, which has not yet reported any coronavirus cases, has suspended Friday prayers, the most important congregation of the week. The United Arab Emirates' Sharia Council issued a fatwa banning people who are sick from attending prayers and services.  Hinduism  India's Prime Minister Narenda Modi said he won't attend next week's Holi celebrations -- the Hindu festival that marks the coming of spring and involves revelers throwing brightly colored powder -- because of the guidance to avoid large gatherings. The country's authorities have also advised states to avoid mass gatherings too.  In the UK and Europe, all events and religious assemblies at BAPS Swaminarayan mandirs have been canceled or postponed until further notice. Other forms of worship are still available to devotees. People can visit mandirs for darshan, the viewing of deities; arti, the ceremony of light; and abhishek, the practice of pouring water over the image of God.  But the organization is encouraging people to avoid non-essential travel.  For those who want to avoid travel but continue to worship, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in London says people can engage in daily darshan on its website  Sikhism  Gurdwara Aid, a UK-based organization that assists Sikh gurdwaras, has advised that gurdwaras increase their cleaning schedules in communal areas and make hand sanitizer and tissues widely available.  The Sikh Coalition has also released recommendations for gurdwaras , including that communities take extra care in preparing and distributing langar (free meals) and parshad (halva) offered to visitors. The organization advised that both should only be served after proper hand hygiene and urged gurdwaras to consider using utensils to serve parshad, which is traditionally served by hand.  The North American Sikh Medical and Dental Association, along with other Sikh organizations, have issued guidance for gurdwaras in both English and Punjabi  Buddhism  In Hong Kong, the Fook Wai Ching She Buddhist temple has been closed as authorities investigate a cluster of coronavirus cases linked to it.  The Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism announced it would suspend until March 20 its Templestay program, which allows participants to experience monastic Buddhist life at 137 temples around South Korea.  More changes may come  Many of the religious leaders making the decisions to close houses of worship, ban large gatherings or modify their traditions acknowledge that their actions may be seen as disappointing or overcautious to some.  It remains to be seen how widespread the virus will become in many communities. The measures these institutions have in place are good for now, but there's no telling how long they will keep having to make adjustments. That, for now, is the big question.  CNN will update this piece as we learn about more measures religious institutions are taking.
2020-03-06	New York (CNN Business) The US travel industry, which has been badly hit by a plunge in sales caused by the coronavirus, could be getting some help from the federal government.  CNN has confirmed that the Trump administration is discussing ways to defer taxes on the airline, cruise and hospitality industries as a way to limit economic damage from the outbreak of the virus. Talks are still in a very preliminary stage, according to officials. The discussions regarding federal help for the industry was first reported by the Washington Post  "We're worried about certain sectors of the economy, airlines coming to mind, ... that might need some help," said Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday. He wouldn't get into the details, although he said, "We're looking for targeted measures that will do the most good in a short period of time."  The CEOs of the nation's major airlines met with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and other members of the administration including Kudlow on Wednesday.  "The airline people who came in were terrific, they didn't ask for a bailout," Kudlow said in a press gaggle that followed his Bloomberg interview. He said he couldn't get into details of what kind of help might be provided, and he stressed that the administration still believes US economy is strong, despite the recent sell-off in stocks  Read More
2020-03-07	The Italian Cabinet is discussing a draft proposal that could put people in the region of Lombardy and 11 other provinces in northern Italy under complete lockdown due to coronavirus, according to a close adviser to one of the ministers attending a Cabinet meeting.  The text of the draft proposal – also sent to CNN by the press office of the Lombardy regional authority – says that people in Lombardy and the other 11 provinces should "absolutely avoid any movement into and out ... as well as within the same territories ... except for travel motivated by unavoidable working needs or situations of emergency."  The draft says the police, the fire brigade and armed forces could be used to enforce these measures.  The measures also could include:  Schools and universities being suspended until April 3.  All sporting events in those regions being suspended, with the exception of professional events. No spectators would be allowed at those professional events.  People in places of prayer standing 1 meter away from each other.  Bars and restaurants enforcing social distancing.  Medical staff not being allowed to take a leave of absence.  "I have received the draft this evening. It seems to go in the direction of confining the spread of the virus, inviting citizens to be prudent by taking decisive measures,” Attilio Fontana, governor of the Lombardy region, said through his press office. “I cannot avoid commenting on the draft. It is a bit messy and it needs, on behalf of the government, some clarification in order to allow citizens to understand what they can and cannot do.”  It's unclear when or if these measure would actually be implemented, because the proposal is still being discussed and the terms could change. It could impact more than 10 million people in Italy.
2020-03-07	(CNN) Universities across the US are places where students live and work in close quarters -- and where international partnerships are a point of pride.  But now, the same details that are selling points in campus brochures have become focal points of a different sort as colleges brace for what's next.  Temporary campus closures, enrollment dips and program cancellations are all possibilities -- though it's too soon to know whether the novel coronavirus will force a large number of US universities to take such extreme steps.  Already, some schools are canceling in-person classes . Officials say there's little doubt the effects will intensify, and they're doing everything they can to plan and prepare.  "Everybody is really feeling this as such a tremendous disruptor, creating this huge sense of anxiety and uncertainty," said Cheryl Matherly, vice president and vice provost for international affairs at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  "It reminds you in a very real way that universities are truly international crossroads, where all the ways that a disease like this could have an impact are coming to bear," Matherly said.  Whether or not you're at a college or university, the virus is threatening to disrupt everyone's daily life -- if it hasn't already. But on campuses across the US, the impact could be particularly acute. Here are five reasons why.  There are more than 1 million international students at US universities. And more than a third of them are from China  American universities started feeling the first ripple effects of the novel coronavirus soon after the disease began spreading in China.  More than 360,000 foreign students in the United States are Chinese; that's more than a third of the total international student population. And for many, fears of the impact the virus is having on friends and family in China have taken an emotional toll.  "One of my grad students said to me she couldn't bear to look at her phone anymore," Matherly said. "There were so many terrible things happening, and how stressful that is when she's sitting here in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania."  The US government's imposition of travel restrictions threw things into further flux, not just on US campuses, but for Chinese students thousands of miles away who were trying to return to them.  "I'm basically stuck in China right now. ... I have no idea when I'm going to be able to come back," said Benjamin Cai, a 25-year-old graduate student in software engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.  US officials have described the travel restrictions as a valuable tool that helped slow the spread of the virus.  "My research funding has been suspended, too," said one Ph.D. student in molecular biology who asked to be identified only by his last name, Yang, because he feared he could face repercussions for speaking out.  More than 830 international students from China were in their home country when the virus outbreak happened and have not been able to come or return to the United States, according to results from a survey of US colleges and universities released Thursday by the Institute of International Education.  It's a small fraction of the total Chinese student population. But beyond uncertainty over the effect the coronavirus could have on individual students' academic careers, American universities are facing an even bigger question: How long will the coronavirus crisis last? And could it impact future enrollment of Chinese and other international students -- something many schools have come to rely on financially?  School officials say it's too soon to say. But they're already coming up with contingency plans.  "We're looking at everything from if this doesn't resolve itself, do we offer students the opportunity to defer their admission to January or the next fall? Do we try to offer some online courses? Do we try to offer courses somehow in country?" said Robin Kaler, associate chancellor and director of public affairs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  "We're trying to be as innovative as we can in terms of finding solutions to this."  More students are studying abroad than ever  The virus is spreading at a time when studying abroad is more popular than ever. More than 340,000 Americans studied abroad for academic credit in the 2017-2018 school year, according to the Institute of International Education.  "Everyone's kind of bracing for the mass cancellations that are about to happen," said Blake Daugherty, a sophomore at Dartmouth College. His internship in China was canceled as a result of the coronavirus, he says, and many of his friends who'd been planning to study abroad in Europe are worried their programs will be called off soon, too.  Italy, where the number of novel coronavirus cases began climbing late last month, is one of the top study abroad destinations for US students. More than 36,000 Americans studied abroad there for academic credit during the 2017-2018 school year.  Kiely Westhoff spoke to CNN from her nearly empty apartment in Florence, Italy. The junior at the University of Colorado was packing up her things and still processing the news that she'd have to leave.  "It's been very emotional and shocking to find out this way, and it escalated very quickly, and none of us were really expecting it. ... It still doesn't feel real," she said.  For students forced to cut short semesters they'd spent years planning, it's a devastating development.  And for universities, the situation presents a host of logistical problems they're trying to solve.  Chief among them: how to handle the prospect of an influx of students returning to campus after housing arrangements have already been made and classes have started.  Some universities are considering offering online classes or shorter spring courses as they plan for the thousands of students soon returning to the US.  US universities have been working hard to expand their global reach  Hosting visiting scholars, planning conferences that bring together experts from around the world and research partnerships that span the globe are all regular parts of campus life -- and now areas the novel coronavirus is threatening to disrupt.  "This is coming at a time when universities have been so focused on becoming more internationalized. There are just more points of intersection," said Matherly, the immediate past president of the Association of International Education Administrators. "We're all now kind of scrambling to determine how to manage through these very real impacts on a very interconnected system."  "I don't think there really is such a thing as a domestic campus anymore. All of our members have some level of international engagement," said Brad Farnsworth, vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents about 1,800 colleges and universities.  Farnsworth said his organization has been fielding calls from schools across the country with concerns about coronavirus.  "Every campus we're talking to is coming up with a plan for dealing with the virus," he said.  Already major academic events have been canceled as a result of coronavirus fears. The American Physical Society called off its March meeting days before the 10,000-person conference of physicists was set to start in Denver. With a large number of attendees coming from outside the US , organizers decided the risk was too great.  Farnsworth said he expects national meetings will continue to be a big issue confronting academic institutions.  "I think everybody is looking at their upcoming travel schedule and really asking themselves, 'Should I be doing this? How do I weigh the risk?'" he said.

MUST WATCH Scientists race to develop coronavirus vaccine 02:24  But even as the novel coronavirus fuels concerns over the prospect of canceled conferences and global partnerships lurching into limbo, it's also spurring more opportunities for international collaboration.  As they work to study coronavirus and develop treatments, researchers at American universities are teaming up with counterparts in China and around the world.  Viruses have been known to spread on college campuses  It's no secret that college campuses can be environments that are conducive to contagion.  "Any place where you have people living in congregate settings, using dining halls, eating in groups of large numbers of people, with lots of social activities, you're going to have potential for outbreaks of infectious diseases," said Dr. Donald Milton of the University of Maryland at College Park.  Milton, a professor of environmental health, has been investigating how respiratory infections spread on campus for years in a study dubbed C.A.T.C.H. -- short for Characterizing And Tracking College Health. And now he's using his research expertise as he advises university administrators on how to prepare for the novel coronavirus.  "We're very actively monitoring the situation and trying to be responsive as things move along. ... We've upped our surface cleaning regimens and have been thinking about what would we do if we needed to quarantine somebody, planning all of that," he said.  With such concerns in mind, the American College Health Association, which represents campus health facilities across the country that care for millions of students, recently raced to pull together new coronavirus guidelines  One goal for the guidelines, which were released this week: pushing universities to prepare now, while they still have a chance.  "This was turned around with lightning speed. ... We knew that window of time was closing," said Dr. Jean Chin, who chairs the association's coronavirus task force.  "You want to make sure people understand the gravity without scaring them. And you just want people to plan," she said.  The guidelines advise schools to evaluate their emergency and business-continuity plans, educate and train staff, stock supplies and develop screening tools and clinical protocols.  Universities in China shut down campuses as part of the country's coronavirus response, and professors there have increasingly turned to online teaching so students can continue their studies. Professors at Italian universities have also moved their classes online.  Li Xiaorong, an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, conducts an online course via a live streaming platform amid the coronavirus outbreak.  And more universities in the United States may find themselves considering that approach as well, depending on what happens in the coming weeks. Some already are.  "For the remainder of the quarter, instructors have been asked to conduct classes and/or exams remotely, as possible, until the quarter concludes on March 20," the school said in a statement Friday -- making it the first large university in the United States to move classes online amid concerns over the virus.  The university said it was following public health agencies' recommendations to avoid bringing large groups of people together in close proximity. Officials said they plan to resume normal class operations on March 30 when the spring quarter begins, "pending public health guidance."  So have rumors and racist incidents  Many universities can draw on past experiences handling outbreaks of other illnesses like the common cold, influenza or meningitis.  But Chin said there's one thing the health association's coronavirus guidelines deal with that's different from past outbreaks: reports of xenophobia.  "Even with Ebola, there wasn't a lot of that," Chin said. "But with this one, campuses were seeing some xenophobia and micro-agressions and behaviors that we just don't feel are appropriate."  As the first murmurs of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China began to spread, so too did reports of racist incidents on college campuses across the US and around the world  JUST WATCHED Racism and xenophobia are on the rise as the coronavirus spreads Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Racism and xenophobia are on the rise as the coronavirus spreads 05:56  And the University of California at Berkeley issued an apology after a post on its health services' Instagram account about "managing fears and anxiety" around coronavirus listed xenophobia as a common reaction to the virus, drawing a fierce backlash online  Chin said there are a number of concrete steps schools can take to stop xenophobia from spreading.  "They're straightforward," she said. "We're talking about getting messaging from the highest levels of campus to speak out about what a healthy campus climate should be."
2020-03-07	(CNN) A US Marine assigned to Fort Belvoir in Virginia has tested positive for coronavirus and is hospitalized, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Saturday.  Hoffman tweeted that the Marine, who he did not name, recently traveled overseas on official business and tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. He is currently being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital.  The announcement so far marks the first positive case for an American servicemember stationed in the US.  Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the White House have been briefed on the development, Hoffman said.  On Friday a US Navy sailor stationed in Naples, Italy , became the first US servicemember stationed in Europe to test positive for coronavirus. And in a separate case last month, a US soldier stationed in South Korea tested positive -- the first US servicemember to do so.  Read More
2020-03-07	(CNN) A US Navy sailor stationed in Naples, Italy, has tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first positive case for a US servicemember stationed in Europe, according to a statement from US European Command and US Naval Forces Europe-Africa.  The servicemember, stationed at a naval support facility in Naples, tested positive Friday and is currently restricted to their residence, according to the statement, receiving medical and other support in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Italian guidelines.  Authorities said health professionals from the US military are conducting what they call "a thorough contact investigation" to determine if any other personnel may have been exposed. They say depending on the results other precautionary measures may be taken.  The statement said personnel that the servicemember came in close contact with have already been notified and are in self-isolation at their residences.  Last month, a US soldier stationed in South Korea tested positive for coronavirus -- the first American servicemember to be confirmed with the virus.  Read More
2020-03-08	(CNN) Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree early Sunday that will put millions of people across northern Italy under lockdown due to the novel coronavirus .  The sweeping move puts the entire Lombardy region, as well as 14 other provinces, under travel restrictions, and is one of the toughest responses implemented outside of mainland China to get the Covid-19 epidemic under control.  CNN is verifying exactly when the lockdown will go into effect.  The announcement came after Italy saw a dramatic spike of 1,247 confirmed novel coronavirus cases on Saturday, the Civil Protection Department said in a statement.  The country has now recorded 5,883 cases and 233 deaths, the most fatalities outside mainland China and the biggest outbreak in Europe.  Announcing the new measures, Conte said: "There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people who are either entering or leaving" the affected areas. "Even within the areas moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons," he said, according to Reuters.  While the lockdown only applies to northern Italy, other measures will be applied to the entire country. These include the suspension of schools, university classes, theaters and cinemas, as well as bars, nightclubs, and sports events. Religious ceremonies, including funerals, will also be suspended.  Other countries in Europe are also struggling to contain outbreaks as cases continue to rise.  On Saturday, France's general director of health, Jerome Salomon, confirmed 16 dead and 949 infected nationwide, and Germany now has 795 cases. The United Kingdom confirmed a second death from the novel coronavirus on Saturday, while 206 people have tested positive, British health officials said in a statement.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on "all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus."  In a statement , the WHO said: "Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well."  Meanwhile in China, search and rescue efforts continued on Sunday for survivors from the collapse of a hotel that was being used as a coronavirus quarantine center.  Rescuers evacuate an injured person from the rubble of a collapsed hotel building in Quanzhou city in southeast China's Fujian province.  The hotel, in the southeastern city of Quanzhou, in Fujian province, came down Saturday night with 80 people inside. Forty-three people were pulled form the rubble, and of those seven people have died, according to China's Ministry of Emergency Management. There are 28 who remain unaccounted for,  "We are using life detection instruments to monitor signs of life and professional breaking-in tools to make forcible entries. We are trying our utmost to save trapped people," said Guo Yutuan, squadron leader of the Quanzhou armed police detachment's mobile unit.  The building's owner is in police custody, according to state news agency Xinhua and an investigation is underway.  South Korea cases surpass 7,000, more than 400 in US  The total number of worldwide cases stands at more than 105,000, with 3,599 deaths. China's National Health Commission reported 27 new deaths from the coronavirus on Sunday, and 99 new infections.  As Italy and Iran suffer from the most deaths outside of China, South Korea continues to battle the worst outbreak.  On Sunday, South Korea announced 367 new infections, bringing the country's total to 7,134, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 50 deaths.  Among the new cases, 294 are from Daegu city and 32 are from North Gyeongsang Province, the most heavily infected areas in the country.  In the United States, 444 cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local governments, and 19 people have died.  This includes presumptive positive cases that tested positive in a public health lab and are pending confirmation from the CDC, and confirmed cases have received positive results from the CDC.  On Saturday, the American Conservative Union announced that one of the attendees at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, tested positive for coronavirus.  President Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence were attending the event, though the ACU said the attendee did not come into contact with either of the men.  When asked by reporters if he was worried about being exposed to coronavirus after he attended CPAC, Trump said, "I'm not concerned at all."  Trump, who was speaking alongside Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro ahead of their dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, also noted that the administration would not cancel any political rallies as the virus spreads.  "We'll have tremendous rallies. We're doing very well. We've done a fantastic job, with respect to that subject, on the virus," Trump said.  Meanwhile, 14 out of 16 coronavirus deaths in the US state of Washington are associated with a nursing home in Kirkland, according to a Seattle & King County Public Health press release. The Life Care Center is at the center the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.  Some Life Care Center patients have gone from no symptoms to acute symptoms within an hour, according to Tim Killian, spokesperson for Life Care Center of Kirkland.  "We've had patients die relatively quickly under those circumstances," he said, adding that the virus was "volatile, unpredictable."  There were 180 staff members employed at Life Care Center as of February 19 and 70 employees now have symptoms of novel coronavirus. The Center of Disease Control has provided "extra nurses, practitioners and doctors," to the nursing home.
2020-03-08	Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar said Sunday he is self-quarantining after he was informed that he and members of his staff had been in extended contact with the person at the Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive for the coronavirus.  “I am not currently experiencing any symptoms, nor is any member of my staff. However, in order to prevent any potential transmission, I will remain at my home in Arizona until the conclusion of the 14 day period following my interaction with this individual,” Gosar said in a statement.  Gosar said he was with the individual for "an extended period of time" and the two of them shook hands several times. Gosar said he has been in contact with the House physician.  He said he is closing his Washington office for this week "out of an abundance of caution."
2020-03-08	Washington (CNN) The US Army has suspended travel for American soldiers and their families to and from South Korea and Italy amid mounting concern over the spread of the novel coronavirus.  "Out of an abundance of caution, Headquarters, Department of the Army has made the decision to stop movement and delay travel of Soldiers stationed in Italy and Korea, which have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control as alert level three for COVID-19," according to an order Sunday by the US Army.  The move comes as the coronavirus has killed more than 3,500 people, and infected over 105,000, according to CNN's tally -- with expanding outbreaks in South Korea and Italy. The new order will have the greatest impact on soldiers and families who have been ordered to move to their next duty station, as they might have been fully prepared to go to their next destination.  "Force Health Protection is the Army's top priority," the Army said. "Protecting the force includes mitigating the spread of the virus and ensuring personnel have the most up-to-date information on appropriate measures to prevent potential spread of COVID-19."  On Friday, a US Navy sailor stationed in Naples, Italy, became the first US servicemember stationed in Europe to test positive for coronavirus. And in a separate case last month, a US soldier stationed in South Korea tested positive -- the first US servicemember to do so.  Read More
2020-03-08	(CNN) — The novel coronavirus may have originated in Wuhan, China, but it has since spread to over 80 countries around the world.  Despite significant efforts to contain the virus, the number of cases outside Asia has shot up over the past few weeks, with Italy currently experiencing the largest outbreak in Europe.  Originally, only northern Italy, particularly the region of Lombardy, had been deemed a "red zone" for the virus and placed under unprecedented restrictions.  But on March 9, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took the extraordinary step of putting the entire country on lockdown as the number of cases nationwide continued to grow.  "All the measure of the red zones are now extended to all of the national territory," Conte said in a press briefing  Museums, archaeological sites, schools and universities are closed, while all major public events and religious ceremonies -- including weddings and funerals -- are canceled.  These restrictions will be in place until at least April 3, with officials advising those who do not comply will face up to three months in prison and a 206 euro ($232) fine.  If the guidelines that were in place in the north of Italy now extend to the rest of the country, movie theaters and nightclubs will also be shuttered.  Restaurants and bars were able to open, but only between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.  "There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people," Conte said on March 8. "And even within the areas, moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons.  "We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big.  "But this is a time where we must take responsibility. ... We need to understand that all of us need to adhere to the measures."  Related content Everything travelers need to know about novel coronavirus  Italy currently has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Europe: 9,172. So far, 463 people have died.  One of the people who has tested positive for the virus is Alberto Cirio, president of the Italian region of Piedmont.  On Monday, British Airways canceled dozens of flights heading to and from areas of Northern Italy. This came just days after Delta Air Lines has suspended its US flights to Milan -- the last flight out departed New York on Monday, March 2.  Italian airline Alitalia has also temporarily suspended all flights from Malpensa Airport in Milan starting Monday, March 9.  These recent developments have left those preparing to visit the country with one pressing question:  Is it still safe for travelers to visit Italy?  Government precautions  In the weeks since the first coronavirus case was detected in Italy, the government has taken "extraordinary measures" to try to contain the virus, including postponing events and suspending the Venice Carnival.  Despite their efforts, however, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in the country has continued to rise.  "Italy has taken a brave decision to contain and mitigate the risk of COVID-19 for its population. WHO fully supports the commitment of the government at state and regions, the people of Italy, all doctors, nurses and health staff at the frontline. United with Italy," Hans Kluge, Europe regional director for World Health Organization (WHO) tweeted in response to Italy's latest move.  Related content Will travel insurance cover flights canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak?  Some of the country's most popular attractions, including the Colosseum and Vatican Museums in Rome, are currently closed and streets are deserted, leaving local businesses struggling.  Travelers, including those departing or arriving in the containment regions by airplane, were to be checked to see whether they have a self-declared travel exemption.  Checks were also introduced for cruise ship passengers arriving in Venice, who will not be able to disembark to visit the city, but will only be able to return to their place of residence or country of origin.  Italy's economy minister Roberto Gualtieri recently said the government would inject 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) into the economy in a bid to reduce the devastating impact of the outbreak.  "Without alarmism, we must have confidence in our abilities and resources, we can and we must have faith in Italy," the country's head of state Sergio Mattarella said in a recent video message to the nation.  Last month, Conte said that the "not entirely proper" management of a hospital in northern Italy had contributed to the spread of the virus in the country.  "Our health system is excellent, our precautionary measures are of the utmost rigor, and we trust that, by virtue of the combined provisions ... we will promote a containment effect," Conte told reporters.  What do the authorities say?  The US State Department has updated its travel advisory for Italy to the second-highest-level warning, Level 3: Reconsider Travel, due to the novel coronavirus.  "The U.S. Embassy continues to monitor the health situation in Italy and recommends that individuals follow Italian official health guidance and avoid government-designated affected areas," reads a statement on its website.  Meanwhile the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all but essential travel to the Lombardy region and the provinces of Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro e Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Vercell, Padova, Treviso and Venice.  travel advisory from the UK Department of Health says that travelers returning from northern Italy should self-isolate for 14 days even if they do not display any symptoms.

The developments in Italy, along with South Korea, where cases have surged past 7,000, and the United States, where confirmed cases have risen to over 560, has increased concerns of a pandemic.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) The Trump administration has had nearly three months to track the spread of coronavirus and get ready for its arrival in the United States. But given the state of the government's level of preparedness and public messaging, one might assume that Covid-19 was born yesterday.  As we look toward another week of headlines about the virus and its impact, we should expect Donald Trump to continue checking off the "do not do" list when it comes to disaster response, including by spreading misinformation with statements minimizing the extent of the problem and contradicting health officials on the availability of testing kits.  While consistent public messaging is important at all times, clear and accurate information is especially critical during a crisis like an epidemic. It's a core pillar of informing people without inducing or feeding panic.  Instead, during this crisis, Americans would be better off muting the President and his continued onslaught of dangerous " advice " on how to deal with the virus. While administration officials scramble to share science-based information, updates on safety measures and more, the President is undercutting their efforts at every turn.  Whether it's sharing his " hunch " that the coronavirus death rate is lower than 3.4%, saying that the United States had contained the spread of the virus from China back in February, claiming that cases are going down, muddying the waters on vaccine development and more, the President is a walking, talking, tweeting disaster when it comes to the communications strategy required during a complex crisis like this one.  Crisis responses benefit when there's a competent team captain.  Because the information coming from the President has been so inaccurate to date, one of the biggest risks right now is that any "believe me this time" plea on coronavirus just won't cut it.  Plus, administration officials' inability to answer basic operational and factual questions how many people have been tested or how we are dealing with infected Americans on a cruise ship increases confusion.  Not to mention that this begs the fundamental question: If we aren't prepared for a deadly virus with weeks of warning, what are we prepared for?  Americans are unwittingly participating in a case study in how not to prepare for a crisis. And the administration's lack of preparation is putting American lives at risk.  According to a whistleblower complaint , US health care personnel responding to suspected infections in late January and early February lacked both training and protective gear -- something that may have directly endangered their health. (The Department for Health and Human Services says it is conducting "an ongoing, comprehensive internal investigation" into the whistleblower's claims.)  One of the most basic ways to contain the spread of the virus is to identify who has it. By doing so, officials can track who they may have come in contact with, and issue notifications to quarantine and monitor for symptoms.  Politico has reported that the Trump administration declined weeks ago to use the test developed by the World Health Organization -- even as a temporary stopgap until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could develop its own. A fault with the US-produced testing kits limited testing capacity and Vice President Mike Pence admitted Thursday there were not enough to meet the demand.  As of Friday afternoon, New York City's Department of Health said fewer than 100 people had been tested for the coronavirus in a city of more than 8 million people. Even as states ramp up their capabilities -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York on Saturday -- the reality is that we face a testing shortage. That means the current number of cases could be underreported while community spread becomes increasingly likely.  The administration should have had the foresight either to expedite domestic US production of test kits or place emergency orders for ones produced abroad. With delays in testing capabilities, some states are urgently trying to identify other options: Hawaii is looking into ordering kits from Japan in the midst of trying to contain the virus.  We don't have enough face masks and respirators while global supply chains are struggling to meet demand. According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the Strategic National Stockpile has about 30 million masks and 12 million respirators -- less than 15% of what we need to protect health care workers, according to National Geographic.  Trump inaccurately blamed former President Barack Obama for botching the rollout of testing kits, but make no mistake, this is happening on Trump's watch. It's true that Trump has signed an $8.3 billion emergency funding bill and there is talk of using executive authority to ramp up production of basic items like masks for health care workers. The administration has also tried to limit travel between the United States and high-risk countries, screening visitors from China, South Korea, Italy and Iran and barring entry to foreigners who've been in some of those areas.

2020-03-09	Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) As coronavirus spreads across the globe , countries in Africa are taking preventive measures to keep the disease out and many are showing a strong level of preparedness to counter its spread.  There are now more than 100 cases recorded in 11 countries in Africa, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.  Egypt remains the nation with the most reported cases with 59, more than half of all confirmed cases on the continent.  Most of the cases in Egypt are among passengers and crew members aboard a Nile cruise ship coming from southern city of Aswan to Luxor, Egypt state-run Ahram Online reported.  Egypt's health ministry announced Sunday that a German citizen was the first death from the virus in the country, according to Ahram Online.  Handwashing at bus stops  Although there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Rwanda, citizens are encouraged to maintain good hygiene.  A video posted by The New Times Rwanda on Twitter shows commuters washing their hands at taps installed at a bus station in Kigali.

It also has two testing facilities, which countries in the region rely on.  In South Africa, with 13 cases of the virus so far, citizens can now walk into private laboratories and pay for private coronavirus tests costing around $75, according to local media report  In Lagos, Nigeria, temperature screenings and use of hand sanitizers before entering public spaces such as banks, offices and restaurants are becoming mandatory to limit the spread of the disease.  Signs informing the public on the best practices to avoid contracting coronavirus can be seen in parts of the city. Scores of health workers have been deployed at international airports in Nigeria to screen all arriving passengers.  Similar measures have also been adopted across the continent and passengers with suspected cases of the virus are placed in quarantine.  'Ebola helped us prepare'  A second patient was confirmed in Nigeria earlier in the week. The person became ill after coming into contact with an Italian citizen who had traveled to Africa's most populous country last month, according to the country's health ministry  The 44-year-old Italian man visited two states before he was diagnosed with the virus in late February. He remains in isolation in a stable condition, officials said.  Health officials have been working against the clock to trace all those who came into contact with the Italian man.  Those that have been traced will remain in isolation while tests are conducted, the country's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said.  Health officials told CNN that Nigeria's experience with Ebola in 2014 has prepared the country for outbreaks such as coronavirus.  NCDC director Chikwe Ihekweazu pointed to the speed with which Nigeria identified and confined the patient as a sign the country is prepared to deal with the outbreak.  "The system worked. We identified this case, diagnosed and isolated within 48 hours of it entering the country," Ihekweazu said. In other countries like Iran and Italy for instance, by the time the first case had been confined, there was widespread contact."  He added: "We successfully managed Ebola ... and are currently managing Lassa fever. We have a strong team that is used to doing this."  The NCDC has been lauded for the level of detail and information it has put out since Nigeria recorded its first case last month.  It publishes daily reports on its ongoing efforts to trace all those who had contact with the first patient and has posted a WhatsApp number where it can be reached for inquiries.  Travel bans  The outbreak has prompted air travel restrictions and cancellations of high-level conferences across the continent.  Uganda has banned visitors traveling from some 'highly hit' countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain.  "Government has decided to ask travelers from the affected countries not to come to Uganda because the high cases they are reporting can easily be imported into the country," the country's health minister Jane Ruth Aceng said in a statement on Monday.  Aceng said those who insist on visiting the East Africa nation from these countries would have to self-isolate at their own cost for 14 days either in their home or at a government facility. Ugandans in affected countries are not exempted from the travel ban.  Uganda also postponed the 2020 United Nations G77 and China Summit scheduled for mid-April in the Ugandan capital of Kampala due to the coronavirus threat, the minister said. More than 6,000 delegates from 136 member states were expected to attend.  Rwanda Air, Kenya Airways and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc are among some African airlines that have suspended flights to China. Ethiopia Airlines, however, tweeted that it will keep operating flights to China while adhering to international standards to ensure the safety of their passengers.  Reported cases  The countries with reported cases as of Wednesday, according to the World Health Organization , include the following:  Algeria -- 20  Burkina Faso -- 2  Cameroon -- 2  Democratic Republic of Congo --1  Egypt -- 59 (includes 1 death)  Morocco -- 3 (includes 1 death)  Nigeria -- 2  Senegal -- 4  South Africa -- 13  Tunisia -- 5  Togo -- 1  South Africa on Wednesday released a statement saying it had recorded six new cases of the virus, bringing the total number to 13.  The new cases include a 33-year-old woman who had traveled to Italy and returned on March 1 and a couple, a 34-year-old male and a 33-year-old female, who had traveled to Germany and returned on March 9, authorities said.
2020-03-09	(CNN) Italy has been put under a dramatic total lockdown , as the coronavirus spreads in the country. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that he is extending restrictions already in place in the north.  "All the measure of the red zones are now extended to all of the national territory," Conte said at a press conference on Monday evening as he also announced a ban on all public events.  The Prime Minister said the move was taken in order to protect the population, and especially the most fragile individuals. His announcement came at the end of a chaotic day that saw prison riots across the country.  Ninety-seven people have died of the novel coronavirus since Sunday in Italy, bringing its total number of deaths to 463. The country has 9,172 cases so far, the most of any European country.  Over the weekend, blanket travel restrictions were announced in just certain areas. The rest of the country will now join the northern provinces under lockdown -- one of the toughest responses implemented outside of mainland China to get the Covid-19 pandemic under control.  The coordinator for intensive care in the crisis unit for the northern Lombardy region told CNN that Lombardy's health care system was "one step from collapse" despite efforts to free up hospital beds.  "We are now being forced to set up intensive care treatment in corridors," Antonio Pesenti said. "We've emptied entire hospital sections to make space for seriously sick people."  He described seeing "a tsunami of patients," adding that there could be 18,000 patients in hospital by the end of the month if the virus continues to spread.  "I've never seen anything like this," he said. "Italians should be worried."  Lombardy President Attilio Fontana said in a statement said the new lockdown measures may not be enough.  "A necessary step but, I fear, still insufficient," Fontana said. "The numbers in Lombardy and in the rest of the country show that the contagion is constantly expanding, with all consequences we know starting with the overload of work in hospitals, in particular in intensive care."  Under the previous north-only lockdown, checks on compliance with the movement ban were to be carried out on main highways and along smaller roads by the Carabinieri (military police) and municipal police forces, while railway police, health authority workers and civil protection staff using thermoscan appliances will enforce the travel ban on the state's railways.  Travelers, including those departing or arriving in the containment regions by airplane, were to be checked to see whether they have a self-declared travel exemption.  Checks were also introduced for cruise ship passengers arriving in Venice, who will not be able to disembark to visit the city, but will only be able to return to their place of residence or country of origin.  Michele De Marsico told CNN at a Milan train station on Sunday that he was trying to work out how to return to southern Italy. "I was worried, so I came here to the train station to check out the situation," said the 55-year-old.  Prison officers stand guard as an ambulance enters SantAnna prison in Modena, inside one of Italy's quarantine red zones, following a disturbance there.  Protests in Italian prisons  The lockdown so far has already produced damaging ripple effects in the country. Inmates overran a number of prisons on Monday, escaping their facilities and kidnapping officers, after visitors were banned in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, the Justice Ministry said in a statement.  Multiple inmates have died in the uproar, which swept 22 prisons. Some continue to occupy their facilities, even reaching the roof in some cases.  In the southern city of Foggia, inmates occupied the entire compound and 43 detainees escaped, before being captured by the prison's police force and other law enforcement agencies, the statement said.  In Modena, in the north, inmates are "still occupying two sections of the prison." There some inmates broke into the infirmary, where they got hold of various drugs, including methadone, the director of the Italian penitentiary system Francesco Basentini, said in a TV interview.  Six inmates died there, he added. Two of the dead died of an overdose, and another from the inhalation of toxic smoke. Basentini said the cause of the three remaining deaths was under investigation.  Meanwhile, in Rome's Rebibbia prison, inmates reached an external area and badly damaged an entire pavilion. And four prison officers were kidnapped in Bologna, where 350 inmates managed to occupy two sections of the facility. Almost all of the jails are "seriously damaged," according to the ministry statement.  Quarantine zone stretches across country  There have been more than 108,000 confirmed cases and 3,821 deaths related to the novel coronavirus worldwide. Despite signs of improvement in Asia -- with China and South Korea recording a slowdown in the number of new cases -- the situation in Europe and North America appears to be worsening.  People wear masks while shopping at a supermarket in Milan, after Italy announced a sweeping quarantine zone covering its northern regions.  Under the initial lockdown rules, schools, universities, theaters, cinemas, bars and nightclubs were closed in Italy's north. Religious ceremonies, including funerals and weddings, and sporting events were suspended or postponed. Restaurants and bars were allowed to be open from 6am to 6pm, and malls and markets could open on weekdays if they could assure a meter (three feet) of distance between each client.  Cars line up to cross the Italy-Switzerland border at the Ponte Chiasso customs post north of Milan, on Monday.  "This is of the utmost importance not only from a healthcare point of view but also economically. A temporary downturn in some sectors or areas of the country is preferable to a longer crisis that could spread to the whole economy via demand and supply effects," the original statement read.  Hotel worker Alice Baldisserri, 38, told CNN that "Milan's hotels are empty, so the jobs are at risk." Baldisserri said Italy's tourism industry had been "hit the hardest" by the outbreak.  The restrictions could take a toll on Italy's already fragile economy. Italian tourism representatives warned last month that 200 million euros ($260 million) in bookings had been canceled since the outbreak was first announced.  The Italian government is preparing measures to support workers and firms across the country, particularly in sectors and areas most affected by the outbreak to try to prevent "lasting damage to the supply side of the Italian economy and permanent employment losses."  The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on "all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus."  In a statement, the WHO said: "Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well."
2020-03-09	Washington (CNN) The US aviation industry and the Trump administration are in a pitched battle over the response to the coronavirus pandemic , three sources familiar with recent calls between officials from several government agencies and US airlines have told CNN.  In a series of contentious conversations, agency officials and aviation executives have clashed over the administration's demand that airlines collect new kinds of data from passengers to help officials track potential virus carriers.  Airlines say they can't meet that demand right away -- a claim some administration officials say they don't believe, according to several sources who tell CNN the calls have deteriorated so badly that agency officials have issued threats, spat expletives and accused airline executives of lying. It is an "epic battle," said one source familiar with the talks.  On one call, an administration official pointed to potential fines if the airlines didn't comply, according to two sources. The Federal Register , where proposed rules are published, laid out the new requirements for added data collection and listed penalties that include fines as high as $500,000 as well as jail time of up to a year.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have even threatened recommending that the administration try to ground planes in the US if they can't get the passenger data, according to one source.  'Shock and disbelief'  The administration officials' vitriol has left airline officials in a state of "shock and disbelief," one source said. Government officials have displayed "a lot of ignorance about what is possible," the source said. Others familiar with the talks contend the airlines seem to be acting unreasonably by not providing the data more quickly.  Another factor adding to the friction is that the administration is considering an advisory discouraging Americans from commercial air travel. Airlines oppose this because of the body blow it would deal their industry, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.  The battle over data is raging as the administration is coming under fire for failing to move quickly or competently enough to protect Americans from a virus that has already killed thousands worldwide and is beginning to hit the US, with more than 500 people infected and 22 dead.  The anger and recrimination are fueled by the fact that for both the White House and the airlines, CoVID19 -- the coronavirus that has infected about 108,000 people worldwide and killed around 3,500 in 93 countries -- poses a profound threat.  The international aviation industry could face losses north of $100 billion if the virus isn't contained soon, with revenues and ridership already plummeting.  In the White House, President Donald Trump has seen stock markets sink, a development that could undermine a central plank of his re-election campaign: that his presidency has delivered a thriving economy.  On Friday, the White House signaled it could offer an olive branch and take steps to ease the financial strain on US airlines by deferring taxes. Airlines, concerned about complicated privacy issues the data collection may pose, have tried to meet the administration halfway, proposing to develop an app and website for data collection.  For now, though, tensions remain high as the two sides remain far apart as both struggle to deal with the pandemic and the airlines brace for the fees and other punitive measures the White House might implement starting March 14.  "If the focus is doing it exactly the way the administration wants, it will be a long negotiation," said Washington Rep. Rick Larsen, the Democratic chair of the House aviation subcommittee. The "airlines don't have all the information the CDC wants," Larsen said.  The standoff over data goes back years, said one source, who added that the CDC seems to be using the coronavirus outbreak to force airlines to agree to its demands. The broader debate is about what role airlines should play in determining if their passengers have been exposed to the disease.  This newest surge of friction began a few weeks ago, after the Presidential proclamation in late January that essentially banned any foreign national from entering the US if they had been to China within the previous two weeks.  In a series of calls, the administration told airlines they had to comply with a directive to ask travelers if they had been to China within the past 48 hours. CDC had initially wanted passengers to answer 22 fields of information but narrowed that to five questions about passengers' contact info. They are particularly interested in recent visitors to China, Italy and South Korea.  Aviation executives said they don't have the technology to do that digitally, explaining it would take six months to make the necessary technical fixes. They could, however, use paper, they said. An official from the Centers for Disease Control accused the airlines of lying, according to two of the sources, and of not stepping up to the plate, leaving the industry executives reeling in shock.  The blowups between administration officials and the airlines have continued, occurring more recently over the requirement that airlines collect more passenger and crew data than they normally would, including email addresses, phone numbers and addresses to help track potential coronavirus carriers.  The demand is a difficult one for airlines for technical reasons as well as privacy issues, particularly in Europe.  But during conversations about the new data requirements, CDC officials made a point of telling the airlines about $250,000 fines they would have to pay if they do not start complying by mid-March. The Federal Register listing that sets out the new requirements also notes that penalties could include criminal charges and up to a year in jail.  Heated calls  Individual airlines often had security or IT officials on the calls to explain technical issues as needed, but the calls got so heated at times that airline representatives themselves piped up.  "There were several calls between the airlines and the US government about this new data collection process, which was initiated in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak," said a CDC spokesperson. "We understand that any new process can be challenging to implement quickly, which is why the rule is currently open for public comment. Airlines have been encouraged to provide feedback through that public comment process."  The calls between airline executives and the agencies are set to pick up before the March 14th deadline, though no date has been set.  Airlines for America told CNN that the airlines "appreciate the collaborative dialogue with the US government to further our shared goal of protecting the safety and well-being of all travelers, which is -- and will always be -- the top priority of US carriers. We look forward to continuing to coordinate and work collaboratively with the top leaders in the Administration and across federal agencies to assess the best next steps."  Before the coronavirus outbreak, airlines were expected to share information they had in their records. The new change means they must collect the information the administration seeks. One airline official told CNN they now feel under the gun to compile the data because the administration could ask for it at any point.  Another industry official familiar with the calls said, "what may seem simple in a world of apps and other things in which it seems like everyone has information about you, it is not simple."  This industry official says it took the US aviation industry two years to meet post-9/11 requirements, which also involved data collection.  Airlines are concerned that the Federal Register gives no clear end date on the data collection and worry that the US government could continue forcing them to collect it "for other purposes."  "It seems they want us to do this for forever and we are pushing back," the first source familiar said. The airlines -- particularly their lawyers -- are worried about what Customs and Border Protection officials will do with the information.  They are also concerned about lawsuits from other countries, particularly given European Union privacy restrictions. "The industry isn't interested in creating a system that would get them in trouble with EU privacy rules," the industry official said, adding that's been a problem for airlines before.  Better ways to trace passengers  Airlines asked the agency officials if the government would back them in the event of lawsuits and were told the administration would offer no support, according to the first source familiar. This source added that one US official told aviation executives their privacy concerns were "bullshit" because no country would push back on the collection of information given the threat CoVID19 poses.  The White House was aware of the rising tensions on these calls when it invited aviation CEOs to meet with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday last week in an attempt to resolve the data sharing issues, according to third person familiar with events.  The White House meeting itself was not contentious, according to people familiar with it.  Airlines for America offered Trump a counter proposal for collecting data, telling him about an app and a website they are developing that would help the CDC get information more quickly, the group's president said after the meeting.  Nicholas Calio, the president and CEO of Airlines for America, said the association felt there were "better ways to trace the passengers coming in" from places with high rates of the coronavirus.  "We've contracted to have a mobile app and a website developed that everybody would have to fill in that would go directly to the CDC with that information and we're moving forward with that," he said.  The airline executives also used the opportunity to ask Trump and other White House officials not to publicly discourage Americans from taking flights, saying their businesses would be at risk if the government begins warning against commercial air travel.  Airlines are already reeling , canceling planned routes due to declining demand and projecting steep losses, with the International Air Transport Association saying the outbreak could cost the industry as much as $113 billion worldwide.  Despite the potential economic blow, Trump dismissed the idea of a bailout after the meeting last week. "Don't ask that question please, because they haven't asked [for] that," Trump told a reporter. "I don't want you to give them any ideas."  But White House officials are considering deferring taxes for industries hurt by the coronavirus, including aviation, two people briefed on the discussions said.  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday the "measures that would be targeted toward individuals or small businesses or perhaps some industrial sectors. That's on the table... we are in the discussion and planning phase."
2020-03-09	Hong Kong (CNN Business) Disney is reopening some areas of its mega resort in Shanghai more than a month after it was forced to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.  The company said Monday that certain shopping and dining attractions would operate at a limited capacity, while the Shanghai Disneyland theme park itself would remain closed.  Disney DIS has also temporarily shuttered its parks closed its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January, and later warned that profits from its facilities in China could drop by $280 million in the current quarter. The companyhas also temporarily shuttered its parks in Japan  The move this week marks "the first step of a phased reopening" in China, according to Disney.  The reopening covers some attractions at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and Disneytown, which includes the famous "downtown Disney" area and sits just outside the park.
2020-03-09	(CNN) Universities from California to New York have closed campus classrooms as the novel coronavirus has affected more than 100,000 people worldwide and its spread has transformed into a pandemic.  The cancellations were initially focused in states and areas hardest hit by the virus, including the Seattle area, California and New York.  In some cases, online instruction is being offered for a limited period, or through the semester. Some schools are telling students to not return to campus for 14 days after their return, depending on the laws in their state.  And many universities are issuing guidance on avoiding travel to China Italy and South Korea , as students are on or about to go on spring break.  These are some of the major institutions that have taken action, including canceling or temporarily suspending in-classroom instruction:
2020-03-09	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korea's top public health official hopes that the country has already gone through the worst of the novel coronavirus outbreak that has infected thousands inside the country.  "We are hoping that we have passed the peak, taking the numbers into consideration, and cautiously expecting we have passed the peak," South Korean Health Minister Park Neunghoo said in an exclusive interview with CNN.  South Korean Health Minister Park Neunghoo.  More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout South Korea, killing more than 50. It is one of the largest outbreaks outside mainland China, where the deadly virus was first identified. However, the number of new daily infections in South Korea has declined in recent days.  Park said that while he believes the aggregate number of infections is high, he is confident in the job South Korea did to combat the virus' spread and would advise other governments who are dealing with outbreaks to focus efforts on early testing and global cooperation.  The South Korean government has been among the most ambitious when it comes to providing the public with free and easy testing options. It has the ability run about 15,000 diagnostic test per day and has conducted 196,000 tests to date nationwide, free of charge. Authorities in the city of Goyang even set up drive-thru testing booths.  Read More
2020-03-09	(CNN) People infected by the novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure, and almost always within two weeks, according to a study released Monday.  That incubation period is consistent with previous estimates from public health officials, and the findings suggest that 14 days of quarantine are appropriate for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used that standard during the current pandemic -- recommending, for example, that people self-quarantine for two weeks after traveling to countries with widespread coronavirus transmission, such as Italy or South Korea.  When it comes to those quarantines, the incubation period "tells us how long it's reasonable to do that," said Justin Lessler, an author of the study and an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  His research, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine , also suggests that symptomatic screening for the virus -- such as temperature checks at an airport -- may be missing recently infected people.  "If somebody is in their incubation period, that is the window when somebody who's already been infected can walk into the country and not be detected by symptom-based surveillance" said Lessler.  That could explain why the CDC's efforts to screen more than 46,000 fliers for "fever, cough, and shortness of breath" have resulted in just one positive coronavirus case, according to the CDC's most recent screening data, which was released at the end of February.  'A narrow window' to estimate the incubation period  To estimate the incubation period, researchers scoured more than 180 reports of coronavirus in places without widespread transmission of the virus -- areas, in other words, where infection was likely due to outside travel.  Because the study was conducted early in the coronavirus epidemic, community transmission at the time was limited to Wuhan, China. That allowed researchers to estimate the "time of exposure" to the coronavirus by determining when a person was in Wuhan -- the only plausible source of infection.  By comparing travel to Wuhan with the emergence of symptoms, researchers could then estimate an incubation period for the virus: usually about 5 days, and rarely more than 12.  "We have sort of a narrow window at the beginning of the epidemic to really tease out what's going," said Lessler. "If it's everywhere, you don't know where people got infected."  It's possible, the researchers said, that their study may have focused on more severe cases of the virus -- which are likelier to make the news and catch the attention of public health officials. The incubation for mild cases, then, might differ somewhat.  Spreading disease without feeling ill  Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he was "impressed by the way [the researchers] have corralled such a range of data from so many sources to estimate something so important."  Hanage, who was not involved with the research, said that "no study can fully nail down something like the incubation period at this point." But the researchers' estimate is "reasonable," he said, "and is also consistent with other independent estimates."  The reported incubation period, however, relates to symptoms of the coronavirus, not infectiousness. It's possible, experts say, that people may be able to spread the virus before symptoms appear or without feeling ill at all.  Both the CDC and the World Health Organization , for example, note that coronavirus infections can be asymptomatic, and the CDC says the role of pre-symptomatic transmission "is unknown."  Hanage, the Harvard epidemiologist, said that those terms may be confusing, but "what matters is if a person can transmit before they are aware they might be infectious." And the answer, he said, "is an unambiguous yes."  Whether that cryptic transmission occurs often enough to impact disease dynamics is another question, said Hanage, but "my opinion is that yes it does."  The "period between reported infections" is short enough, he said, that some people are probably spreading the disease without feeling ill.  'The goal is not necessarily zero cases'  While the new study supports a 14-day monitoring period for some people, the researchers caution that quarantines aren't appropriate for everyone.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  "The focus on containment has lasted a little bit too long," said Lessler, the study author. "We have to remember, particularly now that it seems like the virus is more widespread in parts of the United States and around the world, that the goal is not necessarily zero cases occurring after quarantine"  Instead, he said, the focus needs to be on mitigation -- efforts that seek to reduce the virus's impact on communities once it's already spreading.  The goal should be "to try to balance the risk of people spreading disease and infecting other who might be at high risk, and slowing the epidemic," said Lester.  "You just can't remove every health care worker who's been exposed to this virus from the population," he said. "That would be a disaster."
2020-03-09	Hong Kong (CNN) The number of cases of the novel coronavirus has risen to more than 108,000 globally, with at least 27,000 cases outside of China, as the economic trauma caused by the outbreak continues to impact global share markets.  At least 3,821 people have died as a result of the virus so far, with the majority in mainland China. But figures outside of the country where the virus was first reported are growing, even as China slowly starts to get back to normal  Almost 100 countries and territories have now confirmed cases, and dozens of deaths have occurred in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Italian authorities have placed much of the northern part of the country on lockdown , affecting nearly 15 million people, while other regions will face varying forms of travel restrictions. More than 7,300 cases and 366 deaths have been confirmed in Italy.  In neighboring France, the number of cases has grown to over 1,100, with at least 19 deaths, as fears of a Europe-wide epidemic continue to grow. Germany and Spain have both also reported hundreds of cases.  Wall Street has faced heavy losses for the past several weeks due to fears surrounding the coronavirus. During the last week of February, US stocks had their worst week since the financial crisis, and the economic disruption caused by the virus doesn't appear to be letting up.  Slowdown in South Korea  South Korea confirmed 248 new cases of the coronavirus as of Monday morning, bringing the national total to 7,382. There was one additional death from the virus on Sunday, bringing the national toll to 51.  While South Korea remains one of the worst outbreaks outside of mainland China, the new figures are the lowest increase per day in the country since February 26, raising hopes that the virus may be coming under control.  Around 90% of cases nationwide are from Daegu and North Gyeongsang province, where the outbreak first began. It has been linked to the Shincheonji religious group, one of a large number of new religious movements in South Korea , which has come under intense scrutiny since the outbreak, amid allegations leaders have not done enough to share information with the authorities.

An evacuation flight with foreign diplomats who were quarantined in North Korea landed in Vladivostok Monday morning with 103 people onboard, a source on the flight told CNN.  Foreign diplomats stationed in North Korea had been kept in complete isolation since early February, amid concerns about a potential outbreak there.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree early Sunday that will put millions of people across northern Italy on lockdown . The sweeping move puts the entire Lombardy region, as well as 14 other provinces, under travel restrictions, and is one of the toughest responses implemented outside of mainland China to get the Covid-19 epidemic under control.  Announcing the new measures, Conte said: "There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people who are either entering or leaving" the affected areas. "Even within the areas moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons," he said, according to Reuters.  While the lockdown only applies to northern Italy, other measures will be applied to the entire country. These include the suspension of schools, university classes, theaters and cinemas, as well as bars, nightclubs, and sports events. Religious ceremonies, including funerals, will also be suspended.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on "all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus."

The worst outbreaks are in New York state and California, where a cruise ship has been stuck off the coast for several days, as passengers were tested onboard. Health officials said the Grand Princess liner will dock in Oakland on Monday, and passengers will be transferred to federal military installations.  Multiple governors have declared states of emergency in their territories, as cases were reported across the US, including in Washington DC. An attendee at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, at which President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were guests, has also tested positive for the virus.  Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Paul Gosar both said they will self-quarantine after interacting with the individual who tested positive. While neither man was showing any symptoms, they are isolating themselves out of what Gosar described as a desire to be "proactive and cautious."  Asked if he was worried about a potential exposure, the 73-year-old Trump said, "I'm not concerned at all."  "We're doing very well," he said of the US response to the virus. "We've done a fantastic job, with respect to that subject, on the virus."  Two of Trump's key methods for encouraging his supporters have been affected by the virus: a booming stock market and mass rallies. He has sought to blame the downturn in the markets on the opposition Democrats' prolonged primary process, though few experts agree with this analysis, and so far has not canceled any rallies, even as health officials warned people to avoid large crowds.
2020-03-09	Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, President Trump's new chief of staff, is in self-quarantine as a protective measure, his office said.  "Rep. Meadows was advised this weekend that he may have come in contact with the (Conservative Political Action Conference) attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, now 12 days ago," said Ben Williamson, Meadow's chief of staff.  "Out of an abundance of caution, Meadows received testing which came back negative. While he’s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors’ standard precautionary recommendations, he'll remain at home until the 14-day period expires this Wednesday."  Meadows was not scheduled to start his new job this week, an official said.  Some background: Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep.

2020-03-09	A new coronavirus is spreading around the world, and we'll be bringing you the need-to-know headlines about the outbreak daily. Sign up for our newsletter here  (CNN) Global markets are tumbling as cases climb to more than 108,000 globally, with at least 27,000 cases outside of China. But health experts say it's still not too late to contain the virus, pointing to China -- which has reduced daily infections to less than a hundred.  Over the weekend, Italy enforced the most significant measures outside mainland China , putting a quarter of its population under lockdown, a move previously unthinkable in a Western democracy. The quarantine encircles 16 million people in the northern region of Lombardy and 14 neighboring provinces, including the country's financial and cultural capital Milan and tourist destinations like Venice.  Draconian though it may seem, other nations -- including the US -- hinted that they would not rule out similar moves as their responses move from containment to mitigation.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Oil prices crash and stocks slump again  Oil prices suffered an historic collapse overnight -- the worst one-day crash in nearly 30 years -- after Saudi Arabia shocked the market by launching a price war against one-time ally Russia. The shock to oil also rattled stock markets , which were already in a panic because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Markets in Asia and Europe plunged during trading hours, while US futures recorded massive declines. The turmoil comes after the implosion of an alliance between OPEC and Russia, which rejected Saudi Arabia's plan to rescue the oil market from a coronavirus-induced slump by further cutting production.  Will other European countries follow Italy's lead?  Italy reported a surge in deaths of more than 50% yesterday -- the largest daily increase since the outbreak began last month -- as it took the unprecedented step of shutting down much of its wealthy north. While Italy's been hit harder than anywhere else in Europe, Austria's leader has said it is only a matter of time before others on the continent have to take similarly drastic action. France has announced a ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people, while Germany's health minister is calling for events of the same size to be canceled.  US cases rise  Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked Sunday whether it could become necessary to quarantine entire cities like Seattle. "Anything is possible," he told Fox News . Speaking this morning to CNN, Fauci said there is still a lot that's unknown about the virus, "you almost have a fog of war about it," he added. "There's always that uncertainty that gets people very anxious."  President Donald Trump , meanwhile, insisted he would continue holding his campaign rallies despite a CDC warning to avoid large crowds.  CNN is calling the outbreak a pandemic  From today, CNN is using the term pandemic to describe the outbreak . Neither the World Health Organization nor the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have done so yet, but many experts argue the world is already experiencing a pandemic, Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports.  The specific criteria for a pandemic are not universally defined, but there are three general criteria: a virus that can cause illness or death; sustained person-to-person transmission of that virus; and evidence of spread throughout the world.

2020-03-09	(CNN) The coronavirus crisis spawned new anxiety Monday in the US as confirmed cases soared, a cruise ship came home as another was told to stay away and the widening outbreak played a hand in the worst day for stock markets in more than a decade.  At least 26 people have died from the virus in the United States -- 22 in Washington state, two in Florida and two in California. There are now 36 states with coronavirus cases . Nationwide, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumped to 717 -- at least 150 more than on Sunday -- according to figures from local, state and federal health officials.  Most of the deaths appear to involve patients ages 70 and older, based on broad age range information provided by health authorities.  This is in line with what US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN on Sunday about the pandemic in general: that the average age of those who have died from the global outbreak of Covid-19 was 80, and that the average age of those seeking medical treatment was 60.  The Dow had its worst day since 2008 , falling more than 2,000 points (7.8%) despite a morning trading halt. Not only were there coronavirus fears -- there was the biggest oil prices crash in nearly 30 years.  And in Washington, five members of Congress -- including a lawmaker who shook President Donald Trump's hand -- have said they will self-quarantine after attending a convention where they had contact with someone who tested positive. Another member, Rep. Julia Brownley, a California Democrat, said she would work from home and her office would be closed because she interacted with a person who has coronavirus.  Sen. Mitch McConnell opened his remarks on the floor of the Senate by reiterating health officials remarks that the risk of US citizens catching the virus is low.  "This is not a time for fear," the majority leader said. "It is a time to continue calmly scaling up the serious and smart preparations that have already been under way so the United States can continue working to blunt, slow and mitigate the spread within our borders."  Latest developments:  • The White House says the President has not been tested because he's in excellent health and has not interacted with anyone who has the virus.  • Major League Baseball and other professional leagues are temporarily restricting access to team locker rooms.  It will be days before passengers are all off  Also Monday, the Grand Princess , a cruise ship carrying at least 21 people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, arrived in the port of Oakland after being held at sea for several days and some passengers began to disembark.  Two of the passengers, a Florida couple, have filed a lawsuit against Princess Cruises, which operates the vessel.  Ronald and Eva Weissberger are seeking more than $1 million in damages, according to the lawsuit filed in US District Court in Los Angeles. They claim the cruise line was negligent in allowing the vessel to set sail because two passengers on a previous cruise exhibited symptoms.  In response, Princess Cruises issued a statement, saying: "Princess has been sensitive to the difficulties the Covid-19 outbreak has caused to our guests and crew. Our response throughout this process has focused on well-being our guests and crew within the parameters mandated on us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness. We (sic) not been served with any lawsuit relating to this matter, and we will not comment on any pending litigation."  In a statement about the disembarkation of passengers, Princess Cruises said it will be a "multiple day process."  It will require a step-by-step approach that prioritized the most vulnerable among the ship's more than 3,500 cruisegoers, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Workers set up tents on the dock next to the Grand Princess cruise ship.  Test kits were sent to the ship, and Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that 19 crew members and two passengers aboard had tested positive for the virus.  Passengers will undergo medical screening while at the port by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a statement from Travis Air Force Base.  Passengers showing symptoms and those in need of medical support will be the first off the vessel, ship Capt. John Harry Smith said. Asymptomatic passengers will be taken to military installations for screening and a 14-day quarantine.  California residents will be taken to Travis Air Force Base or Marine Corps Air Station Miramar while residents of other states will go to Georgia or Texas. Charter flights will be arranged for international guests, the captain said.  The ship's 1,113 crew members will remain on the ship when it departs. Plans for their quarantine have not been determined, the cruise line said.  Another cruise ship is in limbo  In Florida, the CDC issued a no-sail order to another cruise ship, the Caribbean Princess, after learning two crew members had transferred from another vessel where at least one guest tested positive for the virus. Neither crew member appears symptomatic and they are both remaining in their cabins out of an abundance of caution, Princess Cruises said in a statement.  The Caribbean Princess will make a brief stop at Grand Cayman for test kits and then set sail for Florida. The ship is expected to remain anchored off the coast of Florida until the "no sail" order is lifted by the CDC, the statement said.  The Regal Princess was held off the coast of Florida under similar circumstances Sunday. Two crew members were tested for coronavirus, and after the tests came back negative the ship was allowed to dock and passengers were allowed to disembark.  The Florida Department of Health issued updated travel guidelines, which mirror CDC guidance. That advisory says passengers who have traveled to a Level 3 country (China, Iran, Italy and South Korea) should stay at home for 14 days and limit their interaction with others after coming back. People who have been to Japan should watch for symptoms and practice social distancing.  Three more deaths in Washington state  A nursing home in a Seattle suburb has become the epicenter of the US outbreak. Nineteen people with ties to the Life Care Center of Kirkland have died. Dozens of residents have been transferred to hospitals, leaving 55 residents at the facility that housed 120 in mid-February.  Three deaths were announced Monday: a woman in her 70s; a woman in her 80s, and a woman in her 90s. They died at area hospitals.  Many of the nation's coronavirus cases have been in Washington, where at least 137 people have been infected.  There are also more than 100 cases in New York, where officials announced 16 new cases Sunday. Officials have urged more than 2,500 people to self-quarantine, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday.  Self-quarantine is reserved for people who may have come into contact with someone who was infected. People in self-quarantine are asked to remain at home until it can be determined that they are not ill. Health officials can issue orders to make those quarantines mandatory and make violating them illegal.  Shifting into mitigation  The US response to coronavirus has shifted from containment to mitigation, Adams, the Surgeon General, said Sunday.  How to protect yourself and others from coronavirus • Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Be sure to wash the backs of your hands and under your nails. • Avoid touching your eyes, mouth or nose • Stay at least 3 feet (1 meter) away from anyone who may be infected. • If you're feeling sick, cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. But don't use your hands. Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately. Sources: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization  "Initially, we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now. We're shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we're helping communities understand you're going to see more cases," Adams said.  "Unfortunately, you're going to see more deaths, but that doesn't mean that we should panic."
2020-03-10	London (CNN Business) Banks in Italy and the United Kingdom are preparing to postpone mortgage payments for people affected by coronavirus as the number of cases in Europe rises sharply.  , a leading UK bank, said Tuesday that customers who fall into financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus can ask for their mortgage or loan payments to be delayed for up to three months.  In Italy, which is suffering the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside China , the economic ministry said Tuesday that mortgage payments would be suspended.  More details of the suspension will be published later Tuesday or on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the ministry said. The measure is being implemented in collaboration with the country's banks, the spokesperson added.  Nearly 100 people have died of the coronavirus in Italy since Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths in the country to 463. Italy has 9,172 coronavirus cases so far.  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced late Monday that quarantine measures would be extended across the country, putting the world's eighth largest economy under a partial lockdown.  The United Kingdom has reported more than 270 coronavirus infections and six deaths. The government has asked travelers who have been to Italy, Iran, as well as parts of South Korea and China, to isolate themselves.  RBS said that clients can also request temporary increases to limits on credit cards balances and cash withdrawals.  "We are monitoring the potential impact of coronavirus across all our customers to ensure we can support them appropriately through any period of disruption," the bank said in a statement.  "We would encourage any customer experiencing financial difficulty to get in touch with us," the bank added.  Lloyds LLDTF RBS and, another UK bank, have each earmarked billions of pounds in financing for small businesses affected by the coronavirus.  — Valentina Di Donato in Rome and Eoin McSweeney contributed to this article.
2020-03-10	(CNN) Concerns about coronavirus are causing a lot of people to rethink their travel plans.  Until recently, travel insurance wasn't much help in a global health scare . But now some insurers and state regulators are responding to traveler's frustrations and loosening restrictions on travel claims.  One of the largest providers, Allianz Travel Insurance is, until further notice, allowing claims for some coronavirus-related medical care and trip cancellation issues.  Travelers who had purchased the company's Emergency Medical Care and Emergency Medical Transportation insurance can now receive that care if they become sick with coronavirus while on their trip.  Those with Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption insurance will be able to cancel the trip if they become ill with coronavirus before or during their trip. An additional benefit for those with Trip Cancellation insurance: it will cover expenses for those who bought travel to mainland China, South Korea or the Lombardy or Veneto regions of Italy before coronavirus became a known event on January 22. The coverage applies to travel that departs before April 1, 2020.  Read More

2020-03-10	A version of this story appeared in the March 10 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.  (CNN) "We don't have any time. Our habits have to change right now. We must give things up for Italy." That was the warning from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who last night placed his entire nation under the strictest lockdown seen anywhere outside of China . The extraordinary move comes as the outbreak worsens across Europe, where every country now has a case of the virus .  It now seems certain that the continent is heading for a recession, raising fears that the rest of the world may not be far behind it. President Donald Trump , belatedly sensing the urgency of the situation as cases spike in the US, promised "very dramatic" steps to help the economy. Questions are also swirling over whether the President himself should be tested after members of his political circle self-quarantined yesterday.  As the world passes 4,000 deaths, China appears to be turning a corner. Today, President Xi Jinping visited the virus' epicenter in Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, in a potent move intended to signal the country's strength in controlling the coronavirus. Nearly 60,000 of China's roughly 80,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  With eye on Italy, Europe weighs restrictions  In real terms, Italy's lockdown means a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces, the suspension of funerals, weddings and sporting events, and movement between municipalities banned without official permission. Those seen to be breaking the measures face fines or imprisonment for three months.  No other European country has gone to those lengths, but with confirmed cases spiking to more than 1,000 in France, Germany and Spain, that could change fast. Spain has closed all schools in affected areas, Ireland has canceled St. Patrick's Day parades, and the European Parliament -- whose president is now self-isolating -- is canceling all "non-core" activities, including committee hearings, seminars and cultural events, to avoid contamination. The UK, which has so far taken a more restrained approach, could see thousands of people contract the virus, its deputy chief medical officer told Sky News  Oil and stock markets stabilize after Wall Street's worst day in a decade  Stocks in Asia and Europe staged a modest recovery today, and US futures gained more than 1,000 points, a day after coronavirus fears and an oil price war sparked a worldwide markets panic. The mood among investors was helped by news of Trump's plan to propose "significant relief" in the form of a payroll tax cut and help for hourly workers, plus expectations of more stimulus measures elsewhere, Clare Duffy and Jill Disis write  Trump coronavirus scare shows no American is immune  Several Republican lawmakers are under self-quarantine after coming into contact with a man later diagnosed with the virus, as US infections soar to more than 700 and states continue to declare emergencies. They include a Florida congressman who traveled with Trump in his limousine and on Air Force One yesterday, and a Georgia lawmaker who was pictured shaking hands with the President on Friday.  Revelations that the disease was only one step removed from the President himself underlined how its advance could put any American at risk, Stephen Collinson writes . The drama is also focusing attention on the fact that the three men left vying for the White House -- Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders -- are all in their mid-to-late 70s, a group with a high set of risk factors for coronavirus complications.

Follow him on Twitter @DrPhillipsMD. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) We don't have to be helpless in the face of coronavirus.  I understand that people are yearning for a sense of control in what feels like an out-of-control situation. I call my father more often than I did a month ago, and he helps me understand the anxiety that he and other folks over 60 feel as they're inundated with reports that they are more "vulnerable" to the effects of the virus.  James Phillips  The anxiety extends way beyond older Americans. Just look at the number of canceled conferences, the number of companies telling staff to work from home, the nationwide shortages in toilet paper, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and other goods in stores and online.  The patients I see in my work as a physician in the emergency department speak of a general sense of helplessness, as though a tidal wave is coming, and there is nothing they can do except wash their hands, try to find black market hand sanitizer , stay home and pray.  The virus known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called Covid-19, is currently spreading across the globe despite our best efforts, and I believe it will continue to do so. Every state, every country. As I wrote for CNN last week, I accept that my profession makes my own infection seem almost inevitable. Naturally, people are clamoring for answers to currently unanswerable questions. Will I get it? How many people are going to get infected and what percentage of them will die? Who will die?

2020-03-10	An Italian woman has been unable to leave her apartment where her husband’s dead body is being kept due to quarantine restrictions, Giancarlo Canepa, mayor of Borghetto Santo Spirito, told CNN Tuesday.  The husband, who had tested positive for coronavirus previously, died Monday at 2 a.m. local time.  “Yes, it is true she is still there with the body and we won’t be able to remove it until Wednesday morning,“ the mayor said. Canepa said quarantine protocol states that no one is allowed to approach the body.  “Unfortunately, we have a security protocol we must follow,” he said. The mayor also said that the man refused to be taken to the local hospital for recovery, which led to this situation. “Otherwise, this wouldn’t have happened,” he said.  The story made headlines in Italy as stories emerged of the wife’s despair at remaining locked up with her husband’s dead body for hours on end.  Local television station IVG.IT posted video interviews with the woman’s neighbors who had just found out that their neighbor had passed away.  “Right now the most important thing is to think about this lady, alone with the body of her husband… No one can come close to help her nor comfort her. We hope this is quickly resolved. Our thoughts are with her and on what she is living through,” the neighbor said on video and whose name was not made public.  IVG.IT reported that the man’s family members are desperate and that his widow has been crying for help from her balcony.
2020-03-10	Washington (CNN) The US military is expected to announce a 60-day pause on all previously scheduled moves for troops and their families in areas significantly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of the discussions.  The Pentagon is also continuing to review whether it can continue with planned military exercises around the world, the source said. That announcement comes as US military leaders announced a joint exercise in Africa would be scaled back to protect forces from potential coronavirus exposure.  Top Pentagon leadership, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, have been briefed on a potential halt on relocations, the source said. The directive would impact so-called 'Permanent Change of Station' moves that routinely occur for US troops and their families when they move to another part of the world on orders from the US military.  For now, the directive would only apply to troops in Italy and South Korea, both of which have been hit hard by the virus. South Korea has more than 7,500 infected people and a death toll of 54, according to the World Health Organization, while Italy has over 10,000 infected people and 631 dead to date.  Commanders in Italy and Korea are already working with families who may have already shipped household goods to another post, to ensure they continue to have a place to live.  Read More

2020-03-10	Hong Kong (CNN) The novel coronavirus outbreak continues to spread globally, sparking a total lockdown across Italy and emergency measures worldwide, as markets recover from Monday's historic rout.  The virus, known as Covid-19, has now infected close to 113,000 people worldwide and resulted in more than 4,000 deaths. The majority of these cases are in mainland China, where the outbreak first emerged -- but the rate of infection has been slowing in the country, and the situation stabilizing, even as the virus wreaks havoc elsewhere  In an apparent show of confidence, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in virus-stricken Wuhan Tuesday , his first visit to the city at the epicenter of the global outbreak since the crisis began. The trip comes as Chinese authorities recorded 19 new cases, 17 of which were in Wuhan, and two were imported from overseas -- marking the third straight day of no locally transmitted cases outside Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital. Of the country's 80,754 patients, nearly 60,000 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.  Other Asian countries like South Korea are also beginning to see a slowdown in the virus' spread. South Korea, which has carried out more than 190,000 tests as part of a free nationwide screening program, recorded it's lowest number of daily confirmed cases of the virus in weeks on Tuesday -- a sign that the country may has "passed the peak" of the outbreak, South Korean Health Minister Park Neunghoo told CNN  But these cautious signs of progress throw into sharp relief the deteriorating situation in the West.  States across the US are declaring emergencies, with even congressmen being self-quarantined after exposure to a patient. And in Europe, the outbreak that began in Italy has spread far and wide, with nearby countries like Germany reporting dramatic spikes in daily cases.  All of Italy is under lockdown  In an unprecedented and potentially legally fraught move, all of Italy and its 60 million residents have been placed under lockdown , Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Monday, part of a raft of sweeping quarantine measures intended to contain the outbreak.  The northern region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces had already been placed under lockdown -- but this new decree will extend those restrictions across the entire country, as the virus continues to spread throughout Italy and mainland Europe.  The drastic measures include blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces such as movie theaters, and the suspension of religious services including funerals or weddings.  To enforce the movement ban, military police, railway police, and health workers are carrying out checks on transportation sites like highways and train stations.  This lockdown represents the toughest coronavirus response to be implemented outside of mainland China, and comes as the country buckles under the weight of the epidemic.  Parts of Italy, particularly the northern regions, are seeing a "tsunami of patients," and the healthcare system is "one step from collapse," said Antonio Pesenti, intensive care coordinator in the Lombardy crisis unit.  So far, Italy has 9,172 cases and 463 deaths -- the most of any country outside of China.  The new lockdown may help slow the virus from spreading further -- but some, like the Lombardy president, fear it is "still insufficient" given the sheer scale and speed of the Italian outbreak.  The virus spreads across the US  The virus is rapidly spreading across the United States too, with new cases reported in at least 20 states on Monday.  The country now has 732 confirmed and presumptive positive cases and 26 deaths, spread out across 36 states and the capital, Washington, DC.  Washington state has been the hardest hit; 22 of the country's 26 deaths were in Washington, which has 180 cases. At least 10 states, including Washington, have declared states of emergency, which give state governments access to emergency funds and powers.  But there are signs of growing frustrations with the federal government's handling of the outbreak. On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing delays, and earlier this month, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee criticized the Trump administration for not sticking "to the science."  In some ways the friction began as early as February, when new federal travel restrictions ruffled state and local officials, who complained the rollout had been opaque and confusing. But these tensions are only ramping up now as the virus threatens to disrupt people's lives and livelihoods.  Multiple schools in Washington have already moved to online learning. Many large colleges like Columbia University, New York University, Stanford, and the University of Southern California are also beginning to hold classes remotely instead of in person.  And employers like Amazon and Boeing have begun asking employees in virus-hit areas to work from home, in an echo of the same measures rolled out across Asia just a month or two ago.  Markets are slowly recovering from Monday's crash  Coronavirus fears and an oil price war sparked a global panic on Monday, with markets entering into stunning decline  Oil prices collapsed after Saudi Arabia launched a price war against onetime ally Russia -- and the crisis was only worsened by the coronavirus, which has slammed economies worldwide and weighed heavily on investors.  Wall Street had already faced heavy losses for several weeks because of the virus; the oil price war served a second blow, and the Dow ended the day with its biggest point drop in history, closing Monday down 2,014 points, or 7.8%.  On Tuesday, markets in Asia Pacific mostly stumbled, with South Korea's Kospi, China's Shanghai Composite, and Japan's Nikkei 225 all falling, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index swung between gains and losses.  There are some signs of recovery , with Dow futures jumping 500 points, or 2.2%, and Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was trading firmly in the green.  But the virus may prove harder to recover from; about $9 trillion was wiped off global stocks in nine days, Bank of America said in a research note on Thursday. And markets are still seeing wild swings, indicative of just how deep investor anxieties run.
2020-03-11	Hong Kong (CNN) The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has surpassed 115,000, with the death toll reaching more than 4,200, as countries around the world continue to grapple with the challenges of containing the pandemic.  On Wednesday, China reported a slight increase in new daily cases, overturning several consecutive days of fewer new infections. The rise, from 19 on Monday to 24 on Tuesday, has been attributed to individuals returning from overseas, underscoring the difficulties faced by governments as the virus continues to spread rapidly across multiple continents.  Neighboring Japan and South Korea also saw an uptick in numbers Tuesday, with Japan reporting 54 more cases -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.  Authorities in South Korea, meanwhile, confirmed 242 new cases, bringing the national total to 7,755.  As with China, the infection rate in South Korea had slowed in recent days, bringing hope that the situation was beginning to stabilize. Though one of the world's worst hit countries, South Korea has been lauded for its widespread testing drive, which has so far seen around 200,000 people screened for the virus. However, new outbreaks linked to a call center in Seoul and the country's military are likely to alarm officials.  Western countries are also struggling with their own worsening outbreaks. The number of cases in the US has now reached at least 1,000, with numerous states declaring emergencies.  In Europe, cases have now been confirmed in every member nation of the European Union. Italy remains on total lockdown as its healthcare system struggles to cope, while nearby countries like Germany and France report alarming spikes in daily cases.  In a speech earlier this week, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated that different countries are facing "different scenarios," with each requiring a tailored response. "It's not about containment or mitigation -- which is a false dichotomy. It's about both," said Tedros.  Hubei aims to get back to business  China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, will allow businesses to gradually come back online and will resume some public transportation services, the provincial government said in a statement Wednesday.  Checkpoints will continue to be set up to screen anyone who wishes to enter or leave Hubei, while the government will also assist workers to return to their workplaces. Schools across the province will continue to be suspended until further notice, it added.  The decision comes as the number of cases in the province has declined significantly. Hubei was reporting thousands of infections a day just weeks ago. There were only 14 new infections reported in Hubei Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission.  During a visit to Hubei's capital Wuhan on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that the country's control efforts had "turned the tide." Of the 80,778 people to have contacted the virus inside mainland China since the outbreak was first identified in December, 61,475 have recovered, according to the country's National Health Commission.  Japan sees a jump in cases  Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared to neighboring South Korea and China, however, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.  Japan now has 1,264 confirmed cases and 19 deaths. A total of 568 of the confirmed cases are on land and the remaining 696 cases are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  "In the past couple of days, for more than one week, we have been seeing an increase," said Yasuyuki Sahara, Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Health, on Tuesday night at a news conference.  Sahara cautioned that it was not yet "an explosive outbreak," with the next one or two weeks likely to be crucial in the country's battle to contain the spread of the virus. "That will determine whether there will be a rapid increase of spread, or whether the outbreak will be concluded," he added.  It's unclear whether the sudden spike in numbers is due to a genuine increase in infection, or whether it's due to factors like better detection.  Health experts in Japan have previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus. Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the "tip of the iceberg."  If a bigger outbreak does arrive, it could serve a blow to the country's healthcare system. Sahara warned on Tuesday that hospitals are limited in capacity, and so the ministry is only encouraging those with severe symptoms to be tested.  Japan's outbreak, and the government's handling of it, has been under heightened scrutiny due to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which organizers say are continuing as planned despite calls for cancellations.  In response to the outbreak, the country's cabinet has approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency. The draft bill, which would see the government given powers to to cancel public events and instruct people to stay indoors, is now heading to parliament, where it is expected to pass both chambers by Friday.  Italy is still under lockdown  The entire country of Italy was put under lockdown on Monday, extending drastic measures and restrictions that had previously only been in place in the north.  Since the outbreak arrived in Italy in late February, travelers have brought the virus from there to several European nations and to other regions of the world, including the US and Middle East.  Tuesday saw the biggest rise in coronavirus deaths since the outbreak began in the southern European nation. At least 168 people died in the past 24 hours, said Angelo Borrelli, head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, on Tuesday.  That brings the national total to 10,149 cases and 631 deaths.  Italy's lockdown means residents' movements are restricted; military police, health officials, and other authorities are conducting checks at train stations, highways, and city roads to make sure people aren't traveling without permission. Schools are shut, public spaces like cinemas are closed, and typically bustling places like town squares are instead empty as people stay home.  Lydia Carelli, a 26-year-old intern at the Italian Supreme Court in Rome, told CNN: "This is the strangest situation that I've ever lived, these restrictions are similar to times of war."  The US reaches 1,000 cases  The situation appears to be worsening in the US , which reached 1,000 cases on Wednesday.  The number of patients identified has doubled since Sunday alone, indicating a dramatic exponential rise in infections. At least 31 people have died.  Washington state, where a nursing home in Kirkland was at the center of the outbreak, is still the hardest hit. California and New York aren't far behind, with more than 100 cases each, and Massachusetts is creeping toward the 100-case mark as well.  As these figures rise, communities are beginning to enact emergency measures. Numerous companies in virus-hit states are allowing employees to work from home; schools and universities are suspending classes, ending the semester early, or conducting online classes; states are declaring states of emergency, allowing them to access federal resources and funding; people are self-quarantining at home.  These measures echo the actions taken in countries across Asia just a month or two ago -- people in the US are even stocking up on face masks and hand sanitizer, reminiscent of the panic buying that swept Hong Kong in February.  But there are also drastic differences; countries like South Korea have rolled out widespread, aggressive testing, running thousands of tests every day. About one out of 250 people in South Korea have already been tested, said the vice minister of foreign affairs on Monday.  By comparison, the US -- with a population six times that of South Korea -- has only run about 3,700 tests in the federal CDC lab, and 4,800 in local public health labs across the country, according to the CDC.  But there could be confusion around these numbers, too -- Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday his department does not know exactly how many Americans have been tested.  "We don't know exactly how many, because hundreds of thousands of our tests have gone out to private labs and hospitals that currently do not report in" to the CDC, Azar told CNN.
2020-03-11	London (CNN Business) The Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a record low and launched other emergency measures as part of a dramatic and coordinated UK response to limit the economic fallout from the coronavirus.  The central bank said in a statement Wednesday that while the magnitude of the shock from the coronavirus remains "highly uncertain," economic activity is "likely to weaken materially in the United Kingdom over the coming months."  A few hours later, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged to do "whatever it takes" to protect the economy. He announced £30 billion ($39 billion) in tax breaks and additional spending, including targeted coronavirus relief measures worth an estimated £12 billion ($15.5 billion).  The rate cut follows the Federal Reserve's decision to slash US interest rates by half a percentage point in an extraordinary move last week. The European Central Bank, which meets Thursday in Frankfurt, is expected to push interest rates deeper into negative territory and announce other measures to fight economic damage from the virus.  The Bank of England said that slashing its main interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25% would "help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm."

2020-03-11	My fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.  Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.  We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.  This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.  From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.  Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.  And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe.  The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.  After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.  To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.  There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.  At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.  Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.  We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.  Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.  The vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.  In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.  My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.  Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.  Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts -- and they are the best.  For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.  To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.  I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.  Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.  Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.  This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.  However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.  Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion.  Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.  Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.  We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the wellbeing of America first.  If we are vigilant -- and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will -- we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us.  No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world.  We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family.  As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.  Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.  God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.
2020-03-11	US President Donald Trump addresses the nation from the Oval Office about the widening Coronavirus crisis on March 11, in Washington, DC. Doug Mills/New York Times/Pool/Getty Images  Europe appears to have been largely blindsided by President Trump’s announcement earlier today that the US was suspending travel from 26 European countries.  Several European ambassadors in Washington tell CNN they didn’t know this was coming, despite having been in contact with the administration over the past few days.  One ambassador in DC said there was “no indication” Trump would go to the lengths he did, while another spokesperson said German officials had no advanced warning this was coming.  “We knew something was coming on travel from Europe (more restrictive travel advice) but not this drastic," the Belgian ambassador told CNN. "What is not understandable is the exception for the UK and the lack of national measures [domestically].”  The Trump administration notified ambassadors after the announcement: Several European ambassadors expressed a need for clarity as they worked to digest what these new measures mean. They had received calls from the State Department after the announcement -- but they "have not yet answers to our questions,” said one ambassador.  State Department officials say they didn’t know precisely what Trump was going to roll out, given the fact that multiple options were on the table.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the Australian Foreign Minister less than five hours before Trump’s address -- and gave no indication of the announcement coming tonight, according to a source familiar with the meeting.  Pompeo did acknowledge that things were going to continue to be painful, and increasingly so, for the next six weeks or so.
2020-03-12	Washington (CNN) European Union leaders issued a withering denunciation of President Donald Trump's decision to bar some Europeans from traveling to the US amid the coronavirus pandemic , as Trump admitted he hadn't told the Europeans what was coming.  "We get along very well with European leaders, but we had to make a decision and I didn't want to take time and, you know, it takes a long time make the individual calls and we are calling and we had spoken to some of them prior to (the announcement)," Trump told reporters Thursday.  Communicating with the European Union -- which consists of 27 members, is headquartered in Brussels and has an embassy here -- would not require calls to individual members. Indeed, the EU response to Trump came from its central leaders.  "The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action," the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.  Trump's announcement from the Oval Office has sown confusion and anger, further straining the trans-Atlantic alliance with Europe, confounding diplomats, surprising some State Department officials and roiling financial markets which plummeted again Thursday.  In a Wednesday evening speech rife with misleading statements , Trump blamed Europeans for the recent upsurge in US cases of the "foreign virus," saying "a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe."  And while Trump claimed that the US was "in frequent contact with our allies," Michel and Leyen made clear the White House gave Europeans no advance notice of the decision, saying flatly that, "the European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation."  'Tons of confusion'  On Thursday, Trump not only contradicted his own statement about communicating with allies, telling reporters that he didn't consult European leaders before his speech, but he also implied the diplomatic affront was meant as payback.  Trump suggested the lack of communication was justified because European countries don't inform him when they raise taxes on the US. "When they raise taxes on us, they don't consult us and I think that's probably one in the same," Trump said.  A top European diplomat who told CNN they received word of the ban literally moments before the speech said they were given no further information. "That's all we know. Total lack of clarity. Tons of confusion."  Vice President Mike Pence tried to deny there was any confusion in an interview on CNN's "New Day." Asked directly why corrections had to be made after the President's Oval Office address Wednesday night, and where the confusion was coming from, Pence said, "I don't think there's confusion."  He went on praise the President for taking "another historic step to suspend all travel from Europe ... for the next 30 days." The US has "recognized, our health experts tracking global data, that the epicenter of the coronavirus has shifted from China and South Korea to Europe," he said. He added that the President made the decision "on the spot" after hearing from his health experts.  In the United Kingdom, which is exempt from the restrictions, Trump's decision was received with skepticism by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who said there "isn't evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of infection."  Speaking to the BBC, Sunak -- effectively the country's finance minister -- suggested the UK was not considering a similar ban, saying all decisions "with regard to flight bans are always guided by the science."  Sunak also said the ban "will have significant impact" in the UK's economy, "but temporarily."  Trump announced that the US will impose a 30-day ban on foreigners who in the past two weeks have been in the European Union's Schengen Zone, the 26 countries that abolished border and passport controls at their mutual borders to encourage free flow of goods, people and services.  With US cases now far outnumbering infections in many of the European countries whose citizens are now banned from traveling to the US, at least one Republican lawmaker expressed doubt about the utility of the travel ban. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney told reporters he doesn't understand why banning travel from Europe is necessary given that coronavirus is already here.  "I'm not quite sure why that's an important part of this," Romney said.  Europeans say they were blindsided  Trump's top advisers had discussed potential new travel advisories on Europe during meetings at the White House on Wednesday, according to two officials familiar with the matter.  But several European ambassadors in Washington tell CNN they didn't know the announcement was coming and were blindsided by it, despite having been in contact with the administration over the last few days.  One European ambassador said there was "no indication" Trump would go to the lengths he did in his announcement and embassies across Washington said they would regroup to sort out their next steps.  Many diplomats said they did not know when they would get clarity on the announcement and had reached out to US counterparts, but even US State Department officials did not appear to be completely aware of Trump's plans.  State Department officials say they didn't know precisely what Trump was going to roll out, given the fact that multiple options were on the table. After Trump's address, officials from the department started calling European ambassadors to bring them up to speed, but weren't able to address all their queries.  "They called me and colleagues after the announcement, but have not yet answers to our questions," one ambassador said.  One European ambassador said their embassy was waiting on further word from the State Department and for a notice by US Department of Customs and Border Protection.  "We wait for precisions on the implementation of the travel ban for Europeans and the many consequences, including in case of no more flights across the Atlantic [and] for other categories, e.g. Europeans wanting to [go] back to their countries etc" the ambassador texted.  A senior Belgian diplomat told CNN that they are "scrambling to understand the precise implications."  Among their questions: how long will the ban last? Belgium has updated its travel advisory to tell citizens the ban goes into effect Friday at midnight and is "indefinite," because there is some confusion over whether the restrictions will actually last 30 days.  Embassies in Washington also have questions about who exactly this will impact.  "Definitely for the expat community it will be important to know who is and who isn't eligible to travel to the United States," the Belgian diplomat said. Some Belgians in the US may want to go home "to have access to the Belgian health care system," but then they might not be allowed back, this diplomat said.  The diplomatic community over the years has learned to live with unpredictability," a European diplomat said. "When we got the news, though the European Union seemed to be a scapegoat, we got to work figuring it out."  This story has been updated to include additional reaction.
2020-03-12	David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) For months, commentators have wondered whether there will be a return to normality after President Trump leaves office. In his address Thursday on the coronavirus pandemic, Joe Biden left no doubt that if elected, that's exactly what he intends.  His speech was for the most part well crafted, his ideas were reasonable, his words calm and reassuring, and he related well with working people and the vulnerable. In short, this was a classic presidential speech.  JUST WATCHED Sanders calls for Trump to declare national emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sanders calls for Trump to declare national emergency 01:50  Substantively, Biden made strong, persuasive arguments on two issues: the need for virus testing here at home and American leadership on public health across the globe. Trump continues to treat testing cavalierly and as a result, his administration has been sluggish in pushing for it, allowing the crisis to get worse.  The number of people tested should start going up soon, and experts say it's likely we'll learn that far more people are walking around with infections than we know. It is estimated that the US is testing around 1,000 people per day; by contrast, a much smaller country, South Korea is testing about 10,000 per day. As Biden said, this is a "colossal" failure.  For many years, American public health officials have prided themselves on the quality of their scientists and researchers and the global leadership they have exercised. The parade of global health specialists from major universities appearing to talk about coronavirus on network news gives a sense of just how robust those efforts have been. Conventional wisdom says that their global efforts have been very helpful in meeting past outbreaks here and overseas.  Read More
2020-03-12	(CNN) Lawmakers in Congress are expressing outrage and confusion as to why the United States is not testing individuals for the COVID-19 coronavirus at as fast a pace as other countries , following closed-door briefings with administration officials who failed to explain the discrepancy.  Several members emerged from an all-members House briefing Thursday morning saying they were told the government is working around the clock to make tests, but the US system is trying to catch up to other countries like South Korea.  Members were exasperated with what they said was a lack of clarity in the officials' answers, as lawmakers struggle to understand how the US has been so far outpaced by other countries grappling with the pandemic.  As he left Thursday's briefing, GOP Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said there is "a growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers" from the administration about testing capabilities.  He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "struggled to give a really strong answer" on why the United States hasn't been able to duplicate testing that is being used in places such as South Korea  The briefings for both chambers come at a pivotal moment for Congress in the pandemic. D.C. offices in the House of Representatives and the Senate are shuttering amid the report of an aide working for Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell tested positive for the virus . Congressional leaders on Thursday officially announced the Capitol will be closed to tourists for the rest of the month. Several lawmakers themselves are self-quarantining as their offices undergo deep cleaning. The House is expected to pass a bill Thursday to respond to the outbreak, but Republican leaders in the House and the Senate have expressed their opposition to the bill.  "I don't think anyone is going to leave that briefing satisfied with what's going on with testing right now ... bottom line, you leave that briefing and we are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there," said Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois. "We are flying blind."  And Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney of New York said it was "simply the worst briefing I've ever received in seven or eight years in Congress."  "The administration has no good answers, no plan, there's no leadership," he added. "I think members of both parties are frustrated and angry, and they have every right to be."  Taking issue with Trump claim  Republican and Democratic senators left their closed briefing furious over the US failure to ensure there is widespread testing -- and contradicted President Donald Trump's claims that anyone can get tested when they want to get tested.  "Our system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it," said Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. "I'm one of them."  GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, an ally of Trump, told CNN that the President "should stop saying" that anyone can get a COVID-19 test if they want one.  "It's not consistent right now" with what representatives of federal agencies told senators, Lankford said. "That is not accurate right now. People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now. That's not here at this point."  "I don't know that anyone is satisfied with where we are right now," Lankford said.  Democrats called out the Trump administration for not having widespread testing available.  "I am very angry and frustrated about how we got to where we are now," said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, ranking Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee. "We are going to continue to push this administration to ramp up the tests but the reality is, and we were just told this by the experts, that they don't have the tests available and can't give us a date they will be."  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, described his feelings as "absolutely appalled."  "I am appalled and astonished that we have lost a critical two months there's still no plan, no strategy, for testing for ventilators, for the basics that are required for people to survive," Blumenthal said. "We're talking about life and death and there's still no plan."  Senate recess canceled  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday that the Senate will be in session next week to work on coronavirus legislation and will not go on a previously scheduled recess. His comments came after an outpouring of lawmakers -- many of them Republicans -- called to cancel the weeklong break.  "The Senate will be in session next week," McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, wrote on Twitter. "I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong."  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said earlier Thursday at his weekly press conference that Democrats and Republicans should negotiate to reach a consensus, calling for members to stay in town to get it done instead of heading home.  McCarthy said he doesn't want to rush the legislation, but expressed optimism that an agreement could come quickly if Democrats choose not to put the current version of their bill on the floor for a vote.  "It's more important we take a moment to step back. Let's work together," McCarthy said. "I think we can get this done in 24 or 48 hours, yes. I think it's critical that we do."  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected that idea during her own press conference earlier Thursday, even as talks between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue to alter the language of the bill to win White House support.  "We don't need 48 hours. We need to just make a decision to help families right now," Pelosi said.  "I'm not sticking around because they don't want to agree to language." She said members who have complaints should "save it for another day," and for future legislation, arguing that now is the time to find common ground.  The main priority for both parties in their conversations with the Trump administration has been on boosting testing for the coronavirus.  During the House briefing, Rep. Raul Ruiz, a California Democrat and a physician, asked the officials why the United States hasn't developed or purchased drive-through testing technology, according to a member in the room. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the FDA, didn't have a good answer, the member in the room said, but Hahn said that American testing has more regulations and takes longer to set up.  At least one lawmaker has become a symbol himself for availability of coronavirus testing. A spokesperson tweeted Thursday morning that Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia has not been given the test after having a meal with a person who tested positive for the disease.  "We tried to get a test for him, not bc he is special, but bc of who he interacts with," tweeted Beyer's spokesperson Aaron Fritschner. "Thought it important to know ASAP. But there aren't enough tests, he didn't meet the risk threshold. Member of Congress." Beyer is one several lawmakers who is self quarantining.  Some lawmakers are calling on canceling the week-long recess specifically to address the testing issue. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska cited nursing home operators in his home state, saying they don't have enough kits to investigate possible cases.  "Instead of going into recess next week, the Senate ought to keep working on the people's business — both addressing the obvious deficiencies in our diagnostic testing pipeline, and debating the President's call last night for economic legislation," Sasse said in a statement. "The Senate has work to do, let's get to it."  This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.
2020-03-12	Seoul (CNN) Before there were any cases of novel coronavirus confirmed in South Korea, one of the country's biotech firms had begun preparing to make testing kits to identify the disease.  On January 16, Chun Jong-yoon, the chief executive and founder of molecular biotech company Seegene, told his team it was time to start focusing on coronavirus.  That was before the virus sweeping China had been named Covid-19 and four days ahead of South Korea confirming its first case.  "Even if nobody is asking us to, we are a molecular diagnosis company. We have to prepare in advance," he remembered thinking at the time.  Fast forward two months, and South Korea is among the world's worst affected countries, with more than 7,800 people infected, and more than 60 deaths.  But one reason why South Korea might have a higher number of infections than other countries is its aggressive approach to testing.  Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) says the country has 118 facilities that can test -- and all report their results to KCDC. To date, the country has While some nations have struggled to get enough test kits to diagnose suspected patients, South Korea has provided free and easy access to testing for anyone who a doctor deems needs it. The country'sCenters for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) says the country has 118 facilities that can test-- and all report their results to KCDC. To date, the country has tested more than 230,000 people.  It has even rolled out drive-through coronavirus testing facilities, where motorists are met by health workers dressed in hazmat suits.  "Detecting patients at an early stage is very important," South Korea's health minister Park Neung-hu told CNN Monday. "South Korea is an open society and would like to protect the freedom of people moving around and traveling.  "That is why we're conducting mass amount of tests."  But to roll out tests en masse, a country first needs test kits.  Staff at Seegene's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, on March 6, 2020.  A secret weapon  In the basement of Seegene's headquarters in Seoul lies the key to the company's coronavirus success.  There the company houses an artificial intelligence-based big data system, which has enabled the firm to quickly develop a test for coronavirus.  Tests known as assay kits are made up of several vials of chemical solutions. Samples are taken from patients and mixed with the solutions, which react if certain genes are present.  Without the computer, it would have taken the team two to three months to develop such a test, said Chun. This time, it was done in a matter of weeks.  By January 24, the scientists had ordered the raw materials they needed for the test kits. Four days later, they arrived. On February 5, the first version of the test was ready.  It was only the third time the company had used its super computer -- rather than its research and development team working manually -- to design a test. It had previously used the system to make diagnosis kits for urethritis, the inflammation of the urethra. The company was able to design the test using only the genetic details that had been released about the virus, and without having a sample of Covid-19.  And it didn't require his teams to work around the clock. Only a few people needed to be involved, said Chun.  An assembly line at Seegene's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, on March 6, 2020.  The next hurdle was getting the test approved for use. It can take a year-and-a-half to submit the necessary documents to South Korea's authorities and get it approved.  This time, it took a week.  Lee Dae-hoon, who led the team of scientists working to develop the coronavirus test kit, has spent his whole life working on diseases. He's never seen the KCDC approve a test kit so fast.  On February 12, Seegene got sign off, thanks to KCDC expediting the process. It was only then that the scientists only knew for certain that their test worked, as the government had evaluated the test using their own patient samples.  Getting the kit to hospitals  By mid-February, South Korea's coronavirus cases had spiked dramatically. On February 23, the country's President Moon Jae-in raised the country's crisis alert to the highest level.  "We're now at a watershed moment with the novel coronavirus and the next few days will be very critical," Moon said in a televised address. "We need to identify the infected people as soon as possible and prevent the virus from spreading further."  Following that, Chun made a snap decision. His 395 employees would drop all other work and focus on making coronavirus test kits. Production of the company's 50 or so other products temporarily ceased for two weeks.  "Emergency operation means all of the divisions, you have to change your job," he said. "All of our teams are focusing on coronavirus product development."  A worker at Seegene oversees an assembly line where test tubes are being labeled at Seegene's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, on March 6, 2020.  That means micro molecular biologists with PhDs have had to drop research and development to take a seat on the assembly line.  "Some times (senior scientists are) doing packaging of the product. It doesn't matter how they are educated, it doesn't matter because we are crazy here," said Noh Si-won, the executive director of corporate strategy.  Seegene is one of four domestic companies providing coronavirus test kits in South Korea.  But the company is also facing international demand from about 30 countries -- including Italy and Germany -- some of which are using Seegene's products on patients, Chun said.  At first, Seegene struggled to meet demand, but now it is coping.  The firm is making about 10,000 kits a week and each kit can test 100 patients. So it is making enough to test one million patients each week, at a cost of under $20 per test.  Noh Si-won, the executive director of corporate strategy, said it is the first time he has seen the company manufacturing at this scale.  The company has three months' worth of stock of other test kits, so it can meet demand for its preexisting orders for a month or two. But Chun said it was important for the company to continue making coronavirus test kits -- and the need goes beyond financial gains.  "We have to be providing or contributing one way or the other to figure it out as soon as possible. That's why (we supply to) the whole world," he says.  What other countries are doing wrong  In other countries, the authorities have struggled to keep up with the demand for testing.  Chun says one possible explanation is that some places may be testing manually, rather than automatically.  All tests start with a nurse taking a swab or a sample from a patient. If the swab is tested manually, a scientist will use a pipette to put the assay kit onto the sample.  But in a growing number of places -- including South Korea -- scientists are using automatic testing.  Rather than a human mixing the solutions, the samples are instead put into a diagnostic machine.  Inside the machine, a robot arm pipettes the solution and mixes the liquids on a number of tests at once. According to Chun, this method takes only four hours to test samples from 94 patients -- four times faster than the manual method. It also reduces the risk of human error or contamination.  The other thing that could be slowing some countries down is the type of test kits being used. There are three genes that can be tested for to confirm coronavirus -- and Seegene's kits are able to test for all three genes in one tube, said Chun. That's not necessarily the case for all test kits.  Chun believes if the United States had access to Seegene's system, the country could test 1 million patients a week. But for now, the US isn't using the test on patients -- it doesn't have approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Chun wants to help health authorities overseas.  "The issue is they have no chance to test the people properly," he said. "Without the proper diagnosis, nobody knows what's going on."
2020-03-12	Hong Kong (CNN) As the novel coronavirus began spreading around the world this year, one common refrain from skeptics of the emergency measures being put in place to stop the outbreak was that it was just like the flu -- dangerous to sensitive groups but routine and not something to get into lockdown over.  We now know that assessment is wrong. At its lowest estimated fatality rate based on current data, Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients , compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza. The coronavirus also appears to be about as infectious as the flu, and potentially more so, especially as there are no specific treatment, cure or seasonal vaccine.  There is one area in which experts hope the virus will still behave like influenza, however, by tapering off in spring.  "This is a respiratory virus and they always give us trouble during cold weather, for obvious reasons," Nelson Michael, a leading US military medical researcher, said of the novel coronavirus last week . "We're all inside, the windows are closed, etcetera, so we typically call that the influenza or the flu season."  Influenza thrives in cold and dry conditions , which is why winter is flu season for much of the northern hemisphere. Behavioral differences in winter can also have an effect. Michael predicted the coronavirus may behave like the flu and give us "less trouble as the weather warms up," but, he cautioned, it could come back when the weather gets cold again.  The hope is that, along with radical action by governments and the public to decrease the number of new cases , reduced spread during warmer weather would give health systems space to cope with the initial influx of coronavirus patients, and buy time for a potential vaccine to be developed.  "This is why it's really important to understand that a lot of what we're doing now is getting ourselves ready for what we're calling the second wave of this," Michael warned.  But what if the virus does not behave like influenza? Could we be dealing with infection rates that remain high throughout the year? More than 100 cases have been confirmed in Singapore, where it's hot and muggy pretty much year round. Australia, Brazil and Argentina, all currently in the middle of summer, have also reported dozens of cases.  Unknown unknowns  There is evidence to suggest the coronavirus does particularly well in certain climates.  Some of the worst hit areas around the world -- from Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, to Iran, Italy and South Korea -- are on more or less the same latitude , with similar temperatures and relative humidity. Researchers at the University of Maryland (UM) have even used this data to attempt to map out other parts of the world that could be at risk of imminent outbreaks.  Though the research remains preliminary, data from the UM study suggests that certain climatic conditions, while not determining whether the virus can survive, may help accelerate its spread.  "In addition to having similar average temperature, humidity, and latitude profiles, (locations along latitude 30-50°N) also exhibit a commonality in that the timing of the outbreak coincides with a nadir in the yearly temperature cycle, and thus with relatively stable temperatures over a more than a one month period of time," the authors wrote.  Brittany Kmush, a public health expert at New York's Syracuse University, who was not involved in the UM study, said that "influenza and other coronaviruses that infect humans tend to follow a seasonality, with cases peaking in the winter months in the northern hemisphere. However, we don't know if this virus will follow a similar seasonality pattern."  JUST WATCHED How vulnerable is the average person to the coronavirus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How vulnerable is the average person to the coronavirus? 05:25  David Cennimo, who studies infectious diseases at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said that many experts "hope -- and I think the correct word is hope -- that the summer will push down the case numbers," though he added that "the data from tropical countries may rain on this hope somewhat."  However, both Cennimo and Kmush cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the geographical data, pointing to the many unknowns that remain about the virus itself and its spread in recent months.  "The question is, are (tropical cases) travel associated, connected to a known case, or cases of unknown origin," Kmush said. "If there is seasonality, we would expect connected cases and cases of unknown origin to decrease as the temperature becomes warmer. I think it is really too soon to tell if we are going to see a seasonal pattern with Covid-19 or not."  Debra Chew, an assistant professor of medicine at Rutgers, agreed that the lack of understanding of the virus and how it behaves makes predicting anything like seasonality largely impossible at this point.  "The dynamics for control of the epidemic may rely on factors that influence transmission of the virus such as infectiousness and spread or the virus by persons having mild or no symptoms, or by behaviors to reduce the spread of the virus," she said. "We are not dealing with a virus like influenza that behaves predictably every year."  Seasonal scare?  Even as cases of the coronavirus have spiked alarmingly in many countries this week, there has also been a glimmer of good news. Outbreaks in both China and South Korea, previously two of the worst hit countries, appear to be stabilizing, with fewer new cases week on week. That is thanks to prolonged intervention by health authorities, including a combination of lockdowns, travel restrictions and encouraging people to work from home and exercise social distancing, as well as helping to educate the public on the need for strict sanitization protocols.  It remains to be seen though, as areas that were at the forefront of the outbreak begin relaxing restrictions, whether cases will climb again, or if the virus is truly under control. As other parts of the world only just ramp up actions to deal with it, many hope they will get a boost from warming weather. However, even if they do, this may not mean the virus is done with us.  "There really still is so much unknown about this virus," Kmush said. "If case numbers decrease over the summer, it is a good idea to prepare for a resurgence during the colder months."
2020-03-12	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's Oval Office remarks on Thursday before a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar were so thoroughly inaccurate it was a challenge to figure out which to fact check first.  We're still looking into some of Trump's claims. But here are the two we picked as most egregious:  Trump falsely claimed anybody coming into the US from Europe is being tested for the coronavirus  When a reporter noted that an American could bring back the coronavirus even with Trump's new travel restrictions on some European countries, Trump said, "Sure. But we have them very heavily tested. If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. We have a tremendous testing set up where people coming in have to be tested."  Facts First: It's not true that Americans or others returning from Europe "have to be" tested for the coronavirus -- and no system is being set up to actually test these returning travelers.
2020-03-12	(CNN) A group of first responders in Washington state, a scientist in California, a woman at an assisted living facility in Florida -- all worried because they believe they might have novel coronavirus but say they can't get tested.  They and many others tell CNN they're suffering symptoms associated with what's officially known as Covid-19, and are worried they may have come into contact with someone who has the virus. They are angry and frustrated after trying to get tested, only to be turned away. Their stories came into CNN's tip line even as Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday told CNN's morning show, "New Day," that anyone with a doctor's order could get tested.  "There's no barrier ..." Pence said. "Make no mistake about it, we're making steady progress."  Anxiety and confusion over the availability and criteria for testing were dominant themes Thursday as the nation continued to grapple with the pandemic.  A primary care doctor in Massachusetts said Pence's assertion that anyone with doctor's orders for testing can get it is "totally false."  Doctor describes "insanity" of coronavirus testing  JUST WATCHED Camerota to Pence: Why are number of tests going down? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camerota to Pence: Why are number of tests going down? 04:06  Aside from critically ill patients who are hospitalized, the physician said the Massachusetts Department of Public Health is only approving testing for people who have been exposed to someone who has already tested positive or who has traveled to one of the five heavily impacted countries outside the US in the past 14 days, which mirrors CDC guidelines.  "It's insanity," said the physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  There are not even tests on hand to use if a patient was approved for testing, the doctor said.  "Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test," the doctor said. "We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic."  The doctor said state and federal health officials "need to loosen the criteria on testing" and "allow us doctors to use our discretion to decide who should be tested."  As of Wednesday only 11,079 specimens had been tested in the US, paling in comparison to the more than 230,000 people tested in South Korea, which has about one sixth the US population.  As of 10 a.m. Thursday, there were 81 public health labs that are verified and offering testing for coronavirus, including at least one in all 50 states and Washington, DC, said Michelle Forman, a spokesperson for the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  Forman said her association estimates the nation's public labs could run up to 10,000 tests a day.  A big jump in testing is needed to get through crisis, experts say  Infectious disease experts say more testing is critical to prevent the spread of the disease.  Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health, an organization of 51 hospitals and about 1,000 clinics, described testing capacity in the US as highly deficient.  "We're still not at levels where we need to be. This has been really slow to get started," said Hochman, who said his organization is currently relying on public lab testing but added that he's been in close contact with commercial diagnostic companies, which he believes will begin testing soon.  Hochman said the turnaround time on testing results has ranged from 24 hours to four days, which he called "unacceptable."  "Testing is so critically important because it helps us as clinicians figure out the extent of the spread. It has implications for how we care for patients and where we put them," Hochman said. "It's unraveling the detective story of how the virus spreads but we are trying to do it now with no data."  If cases of the disease are not identified quickly and community spread continues unchecked, it could soon overwhelm the nation's medical system, just as it did in Wuhan, China, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.  "Now, we're at the critical point where we have to have a big jump in testing and then quarantining and isolating individuals," in order to slow the spread of the virus, he said.  But the reality for many Americans is that they are asking for tests and being turned away.  Anger, frustration, fear: Patients describe testing rejection  Hilal Bayrak of Santa Clara, California, was among those who said he couldn't get the peace-of-mind a test might bring. He came down with a 104 degree fever and started coughing and wheezing about a week ago. He had been working alongside a co-worker who had just returned from Italy. The two shared a keyboard, he said.  His 4-year-old daughter first developed a fever and then a few days later, he and his wife came down with one. Last Saturday, they all went to the emergency room. Each tested negative for flu. Their chests were X-rayed. Same thing -- nothing alarming. Bayrak asked if they could be tested for coronavirus and he says was told that was impossible.  In order to be prioritized for testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that one must have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing as well as have been in close contact with a person known to have coronavirus. Or, they had to "have a history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of their symptom onset."  Bayrak appealed to ER workers, telling them about his co-worker's recent visit to Italy, a country that has all but shut down while authorities attempt to contain the fast-spreading virus.  It didn't work.  "I was angry. I was frustrated," he said. "What's more surprising is that after we left the ER on Saturday they told me to follow up with them if my symptoms got worse. They did. My fever was persistent. I took Motrin, Tylenol every 4 hours. I started having continuous headaches. I had no energy. At the moment, I have a rash on my body."  So the 40-year-old called the ER Wednesday and reported that. "They told me the same thing. I cannot get tested."  In Washington state, as many as 18 firefighters and paramedics who believe they were exposed to people who tested positive for the virus cannot themselves get tested because they have shown no signs of illness, several firefighters and public information officers told CNN.

Dawn Clements has been sick since March 6. The 49-year-old lives in a Largo, Florida, assisted living facility because she suffers from health problems, including a compromised immune system.  Clements said her daughter, 16, suffered from a 103-degree fever and a burning sensation in her lungs two weeks ago, but tested negative for flu. Clements said she began experiencing similar symptoms after taking care of her daughter, and also got a negative flu test.  She says while her daughter has recovered, she has not. Neither has been able to be tested for coronavirus.  "I was told I didn't meet the criteria because I did not travel out of the United States to one of the countries (with spreading coronavirus). I don't know what virus I have. I'm running a fever and I have chest congestion, and nobody can test us here."  You need to 'advocate for yourself'  Pinellas County, where Clements resides, is "prioritizing testing," according to the state health department.  "It's a situation where the most likely to have Covid-19 are being prioritized for testing, and those are people who have been travelling overseas to an affected area or in close contact with a known Covid-19 patient," said health department spokesman Tom Iovino. "We have lots of 'worried well' people who are just wanting to be tested. We are following the CDC advice, prioritizing testing."  In some cases it's not the infected person who wants testing done, but the loved ones around them.  Shelby Koser, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom from Minnesota, said she's worried about her dad, who suffers from asthma and has been battling a cough and fever. She said her 60-year-old father was diagnosed with bronchitis, but that she's skeptical.  "My dad does not normally get this type of sick," she said.  Koser said her father is "too stubborn" to ask to be tested for Covid-19, and that she and her mom are worried for his health and that of those around him.  "I've got two young kids," Koser said. "My concern is that the government isn't testing enough people and that a lot of people already have it."  "You need to be an advocate for yourself," she added.  Where testing issues started  The struggle some faced in getting tested in the US contrasts sharply with the experiences of patients elsewhere in the world.  In Australia, where testing is free and easily available, actors Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, learned they had come down with the virus.  Some of the people contacting CNN complained of symptoms and circumstances more severe than the ones publicly shared by the actors and said they were still denied tests.  The ability for public health labs to test for the virus was hindered last month when the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly. The CDC announced it was remaking parts of them.  Lab directors and workers are upset by what they say is a lack of follow-up information from the CDC, said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He's spoken to lab directors and workers.  "From a morale and readiness perspective, labs were frustrated by the delays and the silence from the CDC," he said.  The Centers' rollout of lab testing "didn't go as quickly and smoothly as we usually see," acknowledged Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director in an interview that aired Thursday with CNN's Sanjay Gupta.  She described the effort to get tests to public labs as "a bit delayed" but also blamed commercial labs, saying they were "really slow to take this on and scale up."  Now, weeks into the crisis, Schuchat said "the jury's out on what exactly is the best way to roll out testing."  "I've heard from colleagues in other countries about concern that there was so much testing going on that people with no symptoms and people who were not at risk clogged up the healthcare systems," she added.  Asked how easy it would be for someone to get tested who is showing symptoms, Shuchat told Gupta, "Well I think an important thing is to be connected to the healthcare system to figure out if you need testing. You know, it may not be the best thing to go into a clinic and ask about that. It may be better to call."  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was more direct in his remarks to Congress Thursday.  "The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it -- we are not set up for that," he said. "Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not."
2020-03-12	(CNN) Uganda has restricted visitors from some countries with what it terms high cases of coronavirus, including China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and Spain.  "Government has decided to ask travelers from the affected countries not to come to Uganda because the high cases they are reporting can easily be imported into the country," the country's health minister Jane Ruth Aceng said in a statement earlier this week.  A revised advisory released Wednesday by the Health Ministry increased the number of high-risk countries from 7 to 16, including the United States and the UK. The other countries include the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Austria, and Malaysia. In the new statement, travelers from these countries are urged to consider "postponing non-essential travel to Uganda."  Aceng said those who insist on visiting the East African nation from these countries would have to self-quarantine at their own cost for 14 days either at home or at a government facility. Ugandans in affected countries are not exempt from the travel restriction.  Uganda also postponed the 2020 United Nations G77 and China Summit scheduled for mid-April in the capital of Kampala due to the coronavirus threat, the minister said.  Read More
2020-03-12	Hong Kong (CNN Business) A historic wave of selling in global stock markets eased on Friday as nervous investors looked to central banks and governments for support as the economic costs of the novel coronavirus outbreak continued to mount.  US stocks leaped higher after the worst day for Wall Street since Black Friday in 1987, with the S&P 500 gaining 5% at the open. And European shares, having notched the worst day on record, raced higher. Germany's DAX rose 7.6%, France's CAC 40 rose 8.3% and the FTSE 100 gained 6.6%.  Italy's benchmark stock index rallied more than 14% after regulators banned short selling amid the market turmoil. The index had dropped 17% on Thursday.  A handful of promising signs from central banks and lawmakers are fueling hope that stronger action is coming. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats are close to striking a deal with the Trump administration on measures to address the crisis. Germany is also stepping up pledges to help companies under stress.  "The fear that really got us down here was the inadequate US policy response from a medical and health care concern," Stephen Innes, global chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, told CNN Business. He added that the bipartisan showing — Pelosi is working with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the package — "is good, and it suggests that there will be a little obstacle to a more massive stimulus effort."

2020-03-12	Top negotiators were unable to clinch a final agreement on a sweeping legislative package to address the economic fallout of the growing escalating coronavirus crisis tonight, pushing talks into Friday as they sought to close out a handful of outstanding issues.  After hours of talks and trading of proposals, including eight separate phone calls over the course of the day between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- who is President Donald Trump’s point person on the talks -- negotiators are still attempting to iron out differences on specific language over a package that is expected to include paid leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance and free coverage for coronavirus testing.  “It’s fair to say we’re close to an agreement, subject to the exchange of paper, and hope to have an agreement tomorrow,” Pelosi told reporters outside of her office this evening. “We’ve resolved most of our differences and those we haven’t, we’ll continue the conversation because there will be other bills.”  Asked if she was confident that there would be a vote on a deal on Friday, Pelosi responded: “One way or another.”
2020-03-12	New York (CNN) Days before lawyers were set to square off this week in a New York City courtroom over a civil dispute between two financial institutions, a partner at one attorney's law firm tested positive for coronavirus. The trial was postponed for two weeks.  Federal courts in Connecticut and Massachusetts on Thursday postponed all jury trials until mid- to late-April. In Michigan, state courts have recommended halting all civil and criminal trials unless a defendant is in custody, as well as any hearings that include "vulnerable" people, such as those over 60 years old. In federal courthouses near Kirkland, Washington, one of the areas hardest hit by the virus, it's turned into a near ghost town — all trials and grand jury proceedings, which would affect prosecutions, are on hold. In Connecticut, there are 12 jury selections scheduled between now and April 10, according to the clerk of the court.  As concerns about the spread of the virus have escalated in recent days , actual infections and fear of the coronavirus have begun to grind the scales of justice in pockets of the country under states of emergency as judges, prison officials and lawyers struggle to balance the constitutional rights of defendants against the concerns that the public institutions could unwittingly become contamination sites.  "The whole system is coming to a halt," said Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney in New York. "I'm sure everybody is wait-and-see at the moment," he added, saying he wouldn't be surprised if prosecutors and defense lawyers seek to resolve cases outside of a trial, either through plea bargains or dropped cases.  Lefcourt said it's not ideal. "Prosecutors who think people should go on trial and don't want to give plea bargains won't be thrilled," he said. "Innocent people who want trials aren't going to be happy" with delays either, he added.  Chief Judge Ricardo Martinez, for the Western District of Washington, said he was curtailing the court's public operations "given the significant number of identified and projected cases of Covid-19 in this District and the severity of risk posed to the public, and given the above public health recommendations from local public health authorities."  In Massachusetts, the chief judge said "the Court is cognizant of the right of criminal defendants to a speedy and public trial under the Sixth Amendment" but said he was taking the step "in order to protect public health." He added that defendants could appeal to him to be excluded from the order.  Range of reactions  The restrictions, which range from full closures to enhanced screening of visitors, come as health officials have established containment zones , recommend limiting large public gatherings, and venues and professional sports teams leagues postpone concerts and games  Federal courthouses from California to New York to Florida have made less extreme adjustments, such as restricting entry to jurors or visitors to the courthouse who have flu-like symptoms or limiting public tours.  The federal courthouses in Manhattan and White Plains, which is 15 miles away from the containment zone in New Rochelle, are functioning close to normal, with criminal trials proceeding and jurors being seated as recently as this week for new trials. Those courthouses are also continuing naturalization ceremonies.  The two courts, both in the Southern District of New York, took steps on Monday to limit exposure by prohibiting visitors who traveled to China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran — five countries designated with high concentration of the illness — within the past 14 days.  On Wednesday, in a memorandum to courthouse staff, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon and District Executive Edward Friedland announced the cancellation of all non-essential activity, such as mock trials and school visits. Until further notice, newly minted US citizens attending naturalization ceremonies will be limited to one guest.  "It is imperative that we continue to run the essential operations of the courts, and that we do so from the courthouses," they wrote in the memo. "We issue this directive with the greatest reluctance. We will resume normal operations as soon as we can," they wrote.  Last week, after the federal courthouse in Manhattan began receiving notification from a handful of prospective jurors and others that they may have been exposed to the virus, court officials took extra steps to scrub certain courtrooms, Friedland said. In one case, an ongoing trial was moved to another courtroom after a juror alerted the judge they may have been exposed.  In New Rochelle, New York, where the local courthouses are less than a mile-and-a-half away from the synagogue at the heart of the outbreak, signs posted to the front warn that anyone who has traveled to the five countries within the last 14 days is not allowed in. Those who were asked to self-quarantine or have flu-like symptoms are also not allowed inside.  The federal courthouse in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Miami, put screening procedures in place similar to those in New York, as has the US Court of International Trade, which requires anyone who has traveled to China, Italy, Iran or South Korea within 14 days to inform court security officers.  In Washington, DC, the federal courthouse will be restricted to judges, court staff, credentialed members of the media, and visitors with official business beginning Friday. "We are taking this temporary action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and out of concern for the health and safety of the courthouse community," a joint notice from the District and Circuit Court chief judges said on Thursday.  Elsewhere, courthouses are functioning close to normal, with only mild notices to the public.  In the Northern District of California, which includes San Francisco, and the Central District, which includes Los Angeles, the courts are operating normally. Both courthouses note they are following guidance from health officials, and advise attorneys, jurors and others who have flu-like symptoms to avoid coming to the courthouses.  The Supreme Court on Thursday said it is closing its doors to visitors, but will remain open for official business. The justices aren't set to take the bench again until March 23rd.  Fears lead to change  Fears about the virus have also prompted changes in prisons around the country. In Mississippi on Thursday, officials said the state Department of Corrections would suspend visitation at facilities that house inmates.  The State Correctional Institution in Phoenix, where Bill Cosby is housed, has begun an "enhanced screening process" for visitors and employees that will prohibit entry to symptomatic people or anyone who has had recent contact with someone presumed positive for the virus.  And in New York on Wednesday, a lawyer for celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti, an inmate at Manhattan's notorious Metropolitan Correctional Center, asked the judge who presided over the case in which Avenatti was convicted to delay an interview required as part of the sentencing process, in part due to concerns over coronavirus.  Avenatti's lawyer suggested to the judge that he would prefer to avoid visiting the federal detention facility "given the uncertainty regarding the Coronavirus, the ease with which it spreads, and the documented unsanitary conditions" at the jail. The judge denied the request for a delay.  Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Correctional Center has restricted inmates themselves from attending court proceedings if they show signs of a fever. "If the temperature is 100.4 or above, such detainees should not be produced and the Court, forthwith, be notified," McMahon, the chief judge in New York's Southern District, ordered last week.  On Thursday, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch proposed that prisons, jails and immigration detention centers consider supervised release and other alternatives for people who are at high risk of impact from coronavirus, particularly those with chronic health conditions.  The impact has already been felt in some civil trials, which have been postponed.  In New York, Vito C Caruso, deputy chief administrative judge for courts outside New York City, postponed a high-profile trial of opioid manufacturers that was set to begin on March 20.  On Sunday, the top-tier law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan learned that one of its lawyers tested positive for the coronavirus.  A lawyer at the firm, who was prepared to go to court, notified the judge and lawyers for the other side, according to a person familiar with the matter. The judge decided to postpone the trial for two weeks.  Law firms reduce "chance of mass infection"  As more people test positive or law firms restrict travel, there could be additional disruptions to specific cases. But so far, many major law firms are trying to act swiftly to reassure attorneys and clients.  Boies Schiller Flexner closed its Armonk office on Monday for one day to sanitize it after one of its employees was in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. The employee tested negative, a person familiar with the matter said.  On Tuesday, Philadelphia law firm Faegre Drinker closed all 22 of its offices after learning that two guests who visited two of its Washington, D.C., offices tested positive for the virus.  "Because the scope of each guest's contact with firm colleagues was not readily known, and because our attorneys, consultants and professionals have been traveling cross-office to support firm integration efforts, we chose to exercise caution while our leadership team evaluated the situation," according to a statement from the law firm.  After hiring specialized service to clean and disinfect each office, most of them reopened on Wednesday. The two Washington, D.C. offices remain closed.  Other law firms are restricting meetings to under 25 people, limiting domestic and international travel, and running tests with half of their employees working from home. The idea, one law firm partner said, is to "reduce the chance of mass infection."

2020-03-12	(CNN) With doctors advising more people to self-isolate and travel reduced between countries to hinder the spread of the coronavirus , its ability to separate people has become starker.  And sport has suffered as a consequence. Sporting events and matches around the world have either been postponed, canceled or played without fans in attendance.  There is uncertainty about whether the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2020 European Championships can go ahead.  But while sporting events have been impacted, athletes themselves around the globe are coming together to help people affected and fight the virus.  A general view of the inside of the empty Mestalla stadium in Valencia.  Help back home  Outside of mainland China, South Korea has reported one of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus.  More than 7,300 coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout the country, killing more than 50 at the time of writing.  And although Health Minister Park Neunghoo told CNN that South Korea has "passed the peak" of its coronavirus outbreak, some of the country's top sports stars are doing their bit to help the country deal with the impact.  The captain of the national team and Tottenham Hotspur forward, Son Heung-Min , donated over $82,000 (100 million won) to a non-profit organization in his home country to "prevent Covid-19 infection."  Good Neighbours International , a humanitarian NGO founded in South Korea in 1991, is providing aid all across the country, supplying masks, hand sanitizers and hygiene kits.  "Even though it is far away [from me], as we face increased corona damage, I wanted to ensure Covid-19 no longer spreads, and to the vulnerable, I hope it will help you a bit," the UEFA Champions League finalist said in an Instagram post.  Son himself has felt the effects of the preventative measures implemented against coronavirus.  He had to self-isolate at home in London for 14 days after returning from Seoul, where he went for surgery on a fractured arm last month.  Son's compatriot, esports superstar "Faker," has also made a charitable donation.  After the virus caused disruptions to events that he was supposed to compete in, Faker -- whose real name is Lee Sang-hyeok -- donated about $25,000 to the Community Chest of Korea charity.  "I felt devastated for those that are working day and night to battle the Covid-19," the League of Legends icon said in his statement.  "I really wanted to aid those battling the outbreak and felt that donating to the Community Chest of Korea was the optimal choice. I hope that everyone bands together to overcome this terrible situation, and hope to see real support being given to those necessary."  In addition, Faker's team SK Telecom 1 will donate all of their streaming proceeds this week to charities to "help low-income families combat the novel coronavirus."  "Coronavirus has affected nearly every corner of the world and we want to do our small part to help the communities where we live and play," T1 CEO Joe Marsh said.  Juventus players celebrate after scoring against Inter Milan in an empty stadium.  Making sacrifices  In Europe, Italy has been hardest hit, with the entire country put on lockdown, as the government tries to gain control of the spread.  All domestic sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3 although Italian clubs in UEFA competitions -- such as Juventus' Champions League tie against Lyon -- are still eligible to play matches behind closed doors.  In response, 18-time top-flight champion AC Milan announced it would donate $284,000 (€250,000) to relief efforts tackling the virus, as well as reimbursing fans who were not able to attend games that took place behind closed doors.  The donation goes to the Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, the emergency response arm of the Lombardy region's government.  A general view of play in the empty stadium in Milan.  "There are things in life more important than football," Milan CEO Ivan Gazidis said in a statement. "At a time when all of us need to take care of the most vulnerable amongst us, we must all act with the utmost responsibility and listen to the advice of the relevant authorities.  "We are all worried about those nearest and dearest to us and about the implications for the future. Milan is more than a football club."  Inter Milan and its owner Suning International will also donate 300,000 medical masks to Italian Civil Protection in support of the crisis.  Elsewhere in Italy, on what should have been one of the most historic nights in the club's history, fans of Atalanta announced that they would be making a donation of $45,000 (€40,000) to a northern Italian hospital.  The team was playing the second leg of its first Champions League last 16 tie in its history in Valencia -- with a 4-1 lead -- but because of the virus, the game was played behind closed doors, meaning fans had to stay in Italy.  And although it was missing out on this momentous moment for the club, the Sostieni la Curva fan group announced it would be returning "the amount of €40,000 from our guest tickets to the Hospital of Bergamo."  "This evening we should be experiencing one of the most beautiful evenings of our history, instead of this emergency situation that is pushing everything to second (place)," it announced on Facebook.  "Because in these weeks, in our city and province, there are heroes that are standing up, working with insufficient resources and overworked hours for the protection of everyone."
2020-03-12	New Rochelle, New York (CNN) Besides a few landscapers bagging up the remnants of pruned trees, hardly anyone was outside in this part of New Rochelle, New York , on a balmy Wednesday as residents prepared for life to change dramatically.  "It's a mixture of boredom and anxiety," said Eli Epstein, 66. "We're cut off from our lives, our friends, our extended families. We're stuck at home."  Like his neighbors, Epstein was bracing for the next two weeks, when officials will implement a 1-mile containment zone in this suburb outside New York City in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus  Beginning Thursday, schools, houses of worship and other places used for large gatherings will be closed, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this week . The National Guard will be deployed to clean public areas within the containment area and deliver food to homes. And a satellite testing facility will be set up in partnership with Northwell Health.  People are allowed to move freely within the zone and outside it, Cuomo said. "But no large gatherings, because the large gatherings are where it spreads."  For Epstein, staying at home has so far meant watching "more TV than I'd like to," he said, noting he's watched the news more than anything else.  "I haven't seen another person besides my wife in a week. It's hard to know how long that continues," he said.  "I love my wife, so it's OK," he added, "but she's ready for some new faces around here, too."  Swings sit empty on Wednesday along North Avenue in New Rochelle, New York.  City is home to a major coronavirus cluster  Cuomo and health officials described the containment area as a circle with a 1-mile radius around the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue.  The house of worship is believed to be the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak after a man who attends the synagogue, a 50-year-old attorney who works in Manhattan , tested positive for the virus last week.  Dozens of cases have been linked to the attorney. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were 121 cases in Westchester County, New York , according to the state Department of Health -- the biggest cluster in the state and one of the biggest in the US.  The area surrounding the synagogue features picturesque homes with sprawling yards and winding roads. Cars zipped past on Wednesday, but the sidewalks were bare, and there were no signs the rapid spread of coronavirus had stemmed from the synagogue.  At the courthouse less than a mile and a half away, signs warned that anyone who's been to China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran within the past 14 days is not allowed inside.  "I haven't left my property since last Tuesday," said Mark Semer, a resident and former president of Young Israel of New Rochelle, told CNN.  "This has been very challenging," Semer said.  He has only left the house a handful of times to be in the backyard, play basketball in the driveway with his son or take the trash to the curb, he said. Right now, he's working remotely via his laptop and phone while he stays home with his wife and three kids.  "It's not convenient," he said. "I like my routine."

MUST WATCH Coronavirus cases jumped from 1 to 100 in less than 10 days in this city 16:47  Mayor: 'I happen to live in the containment zone'  New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said it's important to "understand what the containment zone is and what it's not."  Large gatherings in the area are prohibited, he told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Thursday, but people are free to enter or leave the area as they wish.  "I happen to live in the containment zone myself," Bramson said. "I'll be having lunch with my family in the containment zone a little bit later today, so I think the label alone can create a somewhat misleading impression."  "But at the same time," he added, "I do want to acknowledge it has a significant impact on New Rochelle," pointing to possible child care problems because schools are closed.  A sign in the containment zone in New Rochelle, New York, on Wednesday tells customers the business is closed.  Of top concern are seniors and people with respiratory ailments or compromised immune systems, Bramson said. So, the city has banned visits in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  Asked whether the containment period could be extended, Bramson said there currently aren't plans for that.  "But we should acknowledge that this is a situation that is evolving," he said. "It's changing not just by the day but by the hour. And it's always possible that additional measures will be required in the future."  Bramson stressed the National Guard isn't in New Rochelle in a "military capacity" but for "logistical and operational support."  That sentiment was echoed by Anthony Walsh, a 37-year-old airman first class with the National Guard, who told CNN this was "what I signed up to do."  "It's a service for the community," Walsh said. "It's a selfless thing to do that helps your neighbor."  Residents express confusion and concern  The City School District of New Rochelle announced Thursday it would close all of its schools beginning Friday and going through March 25, mirroring the duration of the containment zone.  "Please be assured that we are doing everything in our power to continue to provide academic opportunities and mitigate any negative impact on our students caused by these extraordinary circumstances to the extent possible," Superintendent Laura Feijóo said in a statement.  Patrick Flores, a 34-year-old physical education teacher in nearby Mount Vernon and volunteer EMT, said he lives less than a mile from the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue, just inside the containment zone. Until now, he's been going to work each day and hasn't been in contact with anyone suspected of having the coronavirus.  But that doesn't mean he's not concerned. Flores has been washing his hands regularly and even changes his clothes as soon as he comes home, he said. "So stuff from the environment doesn't come inside."  "I'm just worried about my parents," he added. "They're both elderly. I'm making sure that they're OK. We have as much supplies as we need."  A worker wears a protective mask and gloves Wednesday at a deli in New Rochelle.  Epstein said he and his wife, Laurie, had some food delivered to the house and have enough frozen food to last them a while.  But he said he's frustrated about what he feels is a lack of communication from officials.  "Nobody has come here to speak to us," he said. "They only speak to us through the media, and it leaves us confused. It's a very frustrating state."
2020-03-12	Hong Kong (CNN) Beijing has announced it will enforce a 14-day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the Chinese capital, as the number of novel coronavirus cases outside Asia continues to rise.  On Tuesday, Beijing reported six new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, all of which were imported cases, including five from Italy and one from the United States.  The new ruling, which came in to affect at midnight on Wednesday, is one of a number of travel restrictions being introduced across the region, as governments step up efforts to prevent a surge in cross-border infections.  Authorities in Beijing will now require all passengers arriving in the capital from overseas to self-quarantine, either at home or in a designated facility, for two complete weeks.  International business travelers, meanwhile, will be required to stay at a select number of designated hotels in Beijing, where they will be tested for the virus. They will not be permitted to leave until their test results have been returned.  The city has cordoned off a whole wing of Terminal 3 at its massive Capital International Airport, using the area to screen and register all international arrivals. The authorities have also set up a transportation hub at an exhibition center near the airport, deploying a dedicated fleet of cars to drive arriving passengers to their homes or designated facilities for medical observation.  Elsewhere in Asia, India announced Wednesday that it would suspend all tourist visas and enforce a 14-day quarantine on all travelers, including returning Indian nationals, arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany.  Hong Kong also extended quarantine measures for travelers returning from high-risk countries, including some regions of France, Germany, Japan, and Spain.  The latest measures mark something of a reversal for much of Asia, which until recently was dealing with an exponential rise in cases -- and the ensuing travel restrictions enacted by countries and airlines around the world.  Beijing was extremely critical of Washington's decision in early February to quickly evacuate consular staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global pandemic, and impose a travel ban on Chinese nationals. At the time, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused the US of "turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction."  Since then, the virus has spread to every continent apart from Antarctica. More than 126,000 infections have been reported worldwide. At least 68,216 have recovered, while more than 4,600 have died, according to a running count by Johns Hopkins University.  The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the novel coronavirus as a pandemic on Wednesday, but cautioned that this doesn't mean the global health watchdog or individual countries will change their response. Calling the virus a pandemic formally acknowledges that it is deadly, has spread worldwide, and has sustained person-to-person transmission.  Global impact  With the caseload in Europe approaching 20,000, concerns are growing that the outbreak is past the point of containment.  President Donald Trump announced in a rare prime-time address that the US would ban all travelers from 26 European countries to the United States for 30 days, though the ruling will not apply to all US legal permanent residents, citizens and some of their family members.  JUST WATCHED President Trump's full coronavirus address to the nation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH President Trump's full coronavirus address to the nation 09:30  The number of patients in the United States has doubled since Sunday. Public health officials have now identified at least 1,272 infections and 38 fatalities across 43 states and the District of Columbia, according to CNN's count. State and federal authorities are moving quickly to stop the virus from spreading further, while some of the country's biggest companies and universities have taken major steps to protect their employees and customers.  The sports world has also been significantly impacted. The National Basketball Association (NBA) took the unprecedented step Wednesday of postponing its regular season after a player tested positive for the virus -- a decision that could cost the league tens millions of dollars in lost revenue, at least temporarily.  The news came after the NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder was abruptly postponed on Wednesday night. Fans were seen shuffling out of the stadium in Oklahoma City before the game began.  The US National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) also announced Wednesday that its March Madness tournament will go on as planned, but fans won't be allowed to attend because of concerns over the outbreak. The tournament is one of the most watched sporting events in the US each year.  Hubei prepares to go back to normal  Though the number of coronavirus cases worldwide is on the rise, China remains by far the most affected country.  As of Wednesday, the country's National Health Commission (NHC) said that a total of 80,793 people had been infected since the pandemic began in December last year -- 62,793 of whom have since recovered and been discharged from hospital. The NHC said there have been 3,169 virus-related deaths during the same period.  But as the United States and Europe grapple with a growing number of cases, the rate of new infections in China has slowed significantly.  China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the pandemic, was reporting thousands of infections a day just weeks ago. There were only eight new infections reported there Wednesday, the NHC said.  On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan since the outbreak began more than two months ago, an apparent sign of confidence that the country's preventative measures -- including sweeping travel restrictions -- are beginning to work.  Hubei authorities said in a statement Wednesday that the government will gradually allow businesses to reopen and bring public transport back online, key steps in the push to get life back to normal.

MUST WATCH NBA suspends season after player tests positive for coronavirus 02:02  The government likely is keen to get people back to work in order to stymie the economic effects of the virus' spread.  Beijing's decision to keep factories shut and restrict the movement of tens of millions of people has affected everything from property sales, to local business operations and major supply chains in the world's second-biggest economy. Stock markets worldwide have reacted with wild swings in part due to coronavirus-related fears about the global economy.  US criticisms  China's response to the virus has been lauded by the WHO, but the United States has been more critical.  Robert O'Brien, President Trump's national security adviser, on Wednesday accused Beijing of covering up the initial outbreak, which he said "probably" cost the world "two months to respond."  "There's lots of open source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals that the doctors involved were either silenced or, or put in isolation or that sort of thing so word of this virus could not get out," O'Brien told a crowd at the Heritage Foundation in Washington  Several doctors in Wuhan said they were muzzled for trying to spread word about the coronavirus. One, Li Wenliang, said he was accused of rumor-mongering by police. Li died last month after contracting the virus and was posthumously hailed as a hero on Chinese social media for his efforts to sound the alarm.  O'Brien also criticized China's decision to not invite the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the country to investigate. The US CDC is considered the world's preeminent public health agency.  "If we had those and been able to sequence the virus and had the cooperation necessary from the Chinese, had a WHO team been on the ground, had a CDC team which we'd offered been on the ground, I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world," he continued.
2020-03-12	A version of this story appeared in the March 12 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.  (CNN) "We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus ... I will always put the well-being of America first." After weeks of downplaying the outbreak, US President Donald Trump addressed the nation last night, announcing a suspension of travel from Europe and emergency action to help Americans affected by the virus.  Yet the speech -- in which he described the disease as a "foreign virus" and blamed Europe for its spread to the US -- brought more confusion to an already rattled nation. Trump's administration was later forced to clarify that the ban would apply to "people, not goods," and only to foreign nationals, not Americans who had been screened before entering the country.  But as infections in the US soar past 1,200 , communal spread appears to be more of a threat than foreign transmission. States are demanding more test kits amid a continued shortage, begging the question of whether the number of reported cases reflects the reality of the crisis.  Trump spoke to the nation at a fearful moment, Stephen Collinson writes . Schools across the country are closing, the NBA basketball league has been suspended, and hospitals are on high alert.  Around the same time Trump was speaking, actor Tom Hanks , known affectionately as "America's dad," announced in an Instagram post from Australia that he and his wife Rita Wilson had contracted the disease.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Airlines and passengers scrambling  "If the leader of the free world is telling you that, you know, your travel is being affected, I would think that we have to give you your money back." That was the advice of an airline worker at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to passengers waiting to board a flight to Dublin moments after Trump announced his new travel ban. Airlines are scrambling to understand and implement the restrictions, as travelers race back to the US before the deadline or weigh canceling trips, Madeline Holcombe writes  The 30-day ban, which starts at 11:59 p.m. Friday, applies to 26 European countries; it doesn't apply to the UK, despite a spike in cases there. Americans and US permanent residents will still be allowed to fly to Europe and return to the US, but will be screened upon re-entry and face quarantine or restrictions on movement for 14 days. It's not clear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up.  In a strongly-worded statement, the European Union said it disapproved of the ban, which was imposed "without consultation."  The UK said today that it would not introduce US-style travel bans, but others are. The Czech Republic will enforce controls on its borders with Germany and Austria; India has suspended all visas until April, effectively barring all foreigners from visiting; and Australia has extended its travel ban for Italy, Iran, China and South Korea.

In Oklahoma City, fans were getting ready for the start of a game between the Thunder and the Utah Jazz last night when players abruptly walked off the court -- one had tested positive for the disease. The decision by one of the world's most profitable sports leagues comes amid growing cancelations and adjustments across the globe.  The latest: the World Figure Skating Championships has been canceled, NCAA Division I Men's and Women's basketball tournaments will proceed but without spectators, and Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers are working on "alternative plans" for their regular season opener. But officials organizing the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo still say that canceling the games is "unthinkable."

2020-03-12	New York (CNN Business) As the coronavirus pandemic gripped the country over the last several weeks, television viewers — especially those supportive of President Donald Trump —- had one place they could go to for some sense of solace: Fox News.  "If you are over the mass hysteria, if you're over politicizing and weaponizing of the coronavirus, you are not alone," Sean Hannity, the highest-rated host on Fox News, assured the network's prime time audience this week.  Indeed, over the past several weeks, top hosts and personalities on the conservative cable news network downplayed concerns about the virus, baselessly accusing credible news organizations of overhyping the crisis to hurt Trump politically.  At other times, Fox News hosts and personalities pointed to the death toll of the seasonal flu, misleading the network's audience into thinking that the coronavirus was receiving more attention because it is novel, while the flu in fact kills more Americans and was, thus, more dangerous and cause for alarm.  That's not to say that some of the coverage on Fox News was not straightforward. The network has had a number of reporters in the field assigned to cover the coronavirus, and shows have hosted various doctors who have provided sound medical advice. Harris Faulkner, for example, hosted a special with four doctors on her program earlier this week. Additionally, some personalities have taken the situation seriously from the start.  But a significant part of Fox News' coverage had been aimed toward framing the response to coronavirus as unwarranted hysteria. The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was particularly notable, given that, like other cable news channels, the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are, thus, the most vulnerable to the disease. The remarks from the hosts also raise concern given how much influence figures like Hannity wield over Trump, especially since Trump recycled some of those very talking points on Twitter and when speaking with the press to initially dismiss the public health crisis.  By Thursday, after Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office and the seriousness of the crisis settled in with millions of Americans, it was clear some Fox News hosts and personalities started taking the matter far more seriously. But still, others have continued to pollute the airwaves with misleading information.  Hannity on Wednesday night, after Trump's speech, acknowledged on his program that the coronavirus poses "a lot of serious risks and a lot of serious challenges." He noted that "in serious situations, truth matters, facts matter." But in the very same episode that he made those comments, the Fox News host continued to mislead his audience.  Hannity contrasted the novel coronavirus fatality numbers with those of the seasonal flu, despite knowing that the novel virus' mortality rate is significantly higher. Hannity knew it was a misleading comparison because the night before on his program Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told him that the coronavirus is at least 10-times more lethal than influenza.  Meanwhile, throughout all of Fox News' coverage, Fox Corporation, the parent company of the network, has taken the matter seriously. The company has restricted all non-essential travel. And, in a Thursday email obtained by CNN Business, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace announced several sweeping measures to protect employees, including asking staff able to work from home to do so starting Monday.  A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment for this story.  "Another attempt to impeach the President"  A top messaging tactic Fox News hosts employed in recent weeks to alleviate fear over the coronavirus was to tell viewers that credible news organizations have over-torqued their coverage in a bid to harm Trump politically.  The main thrust of the conspiracy theory was that journalists are intentionally trying to create panic in the markets with frenzied coverage to sink the economy and hurt Trump's chances of re-election.  "This is yet another attempt to impeach the President," declared Fox Business host Trish Regan Monday night next to an on-air graphic on the screen that read "CORONAVIRUS IMPEACHMENT SCAM."  "Many in the liberal media using -- and I mean using -- coronavirus in an attempt to demonize and destroy the President."  "The hate is boiling over," Regan added. "Many in the liberal media using -- and I mean using -- coronavirus in an attempt to demonize and destroy the President."  Hannity, arguably Trump's top defender on television, said Monday night that he believed news coverage from the media "mob" could be characterized as "manufactured, irresponsible, over-the-top rhetoric."  "I'm sure in the end the mob in the media, well they will be advancing their new conspiracy theory and their newest hoax," Hannity said at the top of his program, later adding, "the coverage we are seeing from the media and the mob is beyond despicable and political."  And Laura Ingraham, whose show "The Ingraham Angle" airs after Hannity's program, called members of the media "panic pushers" who "went into overdrive after the market closed."  "Fox & Friends Weekend" co-host Pete Hegseth has gone even further. In a recent appearance, the host suggested that members of the media want to see people become infected in an effort to hurt Trump.  "Watch the Democrats, watch the media, you start to feel like they are rooting for coronavirus to spread," Hegseth said, adding that he didn't make the statement "flippantly."  Hegseth alleged that journalists and Democratic politicians are actively "rooting" for infections for "one reason" alone: "They have yet to find a reason to try to drag down the presidency of Donald Trump."  "There is no reason to believe [the coronavirus is] more problematic or deadly than influenza"  Another line of messaging pushed by Fox News personalities is that the seasonal flu is a greater cause for concern than the novel coronavirus.  A regular part of Fox News' coverage has been to cite how many Americans are infected with and die from the seasonal flu each year. Those numbers have then been contrasted with the coronavirus death toll, which without context might have left viewers with the impression that there wasn't much cause for concern.  JUST WATCHED 'SNL' mocks Fox News' coronavirus coverage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'SNL' mocks Fox News' coronavirus coverage 01:43  Martha MacCallum, a prominent Fox News anchor, said Monday night, "It feels like we -- you know, when you think about how many people die of the flu and everyone just goes about their business — 30-something-thousand people and this situation you are just wondering."  What MacCallum didn't note -- which is crucial -- is that experts believe the mortality rate for the novel coronavirus is much higher than that of the seasonal flu.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said the global mortality rate for the novel coronavirus is about 3.4%. The NIH's Fauci, himself an immunologist, has said the mortality rate is about 2%.  Fauci has stressed that the seasonal flu is far less deadly than the novel coronavirus. As he put it, "The mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1% so even if it goes down to 1% it's still 10 times more fatal."  The concern is that if the novel coronavirus infects millions of Americans, as the seasonal flu does each year, the death toll will be significant.  But despite the data, Fox News personalities continue to draw comparisons between the two.  "The mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1% so even if it goes down to 1% it's still 10 times more fatal."  Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical correspondent and professor at New York University's medical school, cited data from one country -- South Korea -- to suggest on Friday the mortality rate might actually be much lower than what the CDC and WHO have stated.  "Let me tell you something, let's look at South Korea, an organized country where they have been screening everyone, well over 100,000, now over 200,000 people. They found about 6,000 cases," Siegel said. "Deaths a little bit less than 30, that's a 0.7% death rate in an organized society with a great healthcare system. Guess what that reminds me of? Influenza maybe slightly more percentage-wise than influenza."  "This is a contagious virus, we're concerned about it," added Siegel, who did not respond to a request for comment. "We don't have a vaccine for it, but there's no reason to believe that it's actually more problematic or deadly than influenza."  Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News weekend host who is strongly supportive of Trump, sowed doubt about the coronavirus' mortality rate during her show Saturday.  "Now, they say the mortality rate for coronavirus is higher than a flu," Pirro said. "But consider though, that we have a flu vaccine — and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have the flu vaccine, the flu would be a pandemic. So all the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly, doesn't reflect reality. Without a vaccine, the flu would be far more deadly."  Fox's audience is the most vulnerable  The disinformation being disseminated by Fox News is especially alarming given that, like most cable news channels, its audience skews older.  According to Nielsen Media Research, a firm that measures television audiences, the median age of a Fox News viewer for the month of February was 67.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that "older adults" are "at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness."  Infections disease experts have said that anyone over 60 should take precautions, including avoiding places with large crowds.  "This ought to be top of mind for people over 60, and those with underlying health problems," said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime CDC adviser.  "It's definitely not just the flu"  It's worth noting that there's one prominent Fox News prime time host who for weeks has been sounding a loud alarm over the coronavirus: Tucker Carlson.  "People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem."  While it's difficult to ignore the anti-immigration overtones in his coverage (referring to the disease, for instance, as the "Chinese Coronavirus"), Carlson called out conservatives for dismissing what he told viewers is a "very serious problem."  "People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem," Carlson said Monday night. "'It's just partisan politics,' they say. 'Calm down. In the end this was just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass."  Carlson said people who make such arguments may have good intentions, but they're wrong. "They may not know any better," Carlson said. "Maybe they're just not paying attention, or maybe they believe they're serving some higher cause by shading reality. ... And there's an election coming up. Best not to say anything that might help the other side. We get it. But they're wrong."  Carlson called the coronavirus pandemic a "major event," stressing, "It's definitely not just the flu."  Strict measures internally  Internally, Fox News has taken the rapidly developing situation seriously.  Over the last few weeks, the network has made hand sanitizer readily available for employees, increased the frequency of cleanings in high-traffic areas, and held calls with employees to discuss concerns.  "Please keep in mind that viewers rely on us to stay informed during a crisis of this magnitude..."  In their email to employees telling those who can work from home to do so, Fox executives Scott and Wallace also said, "Programming changes will be enacted in the coming days on some of our platforms — our programming leadership team is working on this now and will communicate that accordingly."  Additionally, Scott and Wallace announced to staff other measures being implemented, including: reducing in-studio bookings and directing shows to rely on Skype or remote studios; directing employees to cancel all in-person meetings; canceling the studio audience for "The Greg Gutfeld" show; and canceling the network's Ad Sales Upfront presentation scheduled for March 24.  Scott and Wallace concluded their email calling the situation a "challenging time."  "Please keep in mind that viewers rely on us to stay informed during a crisis of this magnitude and we are providing an important public service to our audience by functioning as a resource for all Americans," they said.
2020-03-12	Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday dismissed suggestions that there was confusion surrounding President Donald Trump's address to the nation about coronavirus despite the administration having to later make clarifications about travel restrictions.  "I don't think there's confusion," Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the crisis, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" Thursday. But he was unable to provide figures on how many Americans have been tested for the virus, which has been a key question as the crisis has spread throughout the country and disrupted everyday life.  Speaking to the nation Wednesday night, Trump announced that "all travel from Europe to the United States" would be banned for 30 days beginning Friday, with exceptions for the United Kingdom. After Trump's remarks, the administration clarified that the travel restriction did not apply to Americans or US permanent residents, nor did it apply to all of Europe but to nations in the Schengen zone.  Trump was also forced to clarify he was not blocking goods from Europe, despite saying in his address that his ban would "apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo" across the Atlantic.  On CNN Thursday, Pence elaborated on the travel restrictions, saying that Americans coming home will be funneled through 13 different airports, where they will be screened for the novel coronavirus. Americans and legal residents returning to the US will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, Pence said.  Read More

For those between ages 60 to 70, the case fatality rate is somewhere between 1.44% (in South Korea ) and 3.6% (in China ). And it goes up from there dramatically if you're older.

2020-03-13	CNN  Miami Mayor Francis Suarez learned Friday that he tested positive for coronavirus and he said he's already starting to feel the symptoms.  "You know it feels similar to the on set of a cold," he told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday.  Suarez said he plans to share his experience in the hopes that "it calms people down because it's something I'm going through myself."  The mayor went on to say that he's not sure where he caught the virus, but noted that he was recently in close proximity of someone who tested positive for the virus.  In a statement that he released earlier, Suarez said, "If we did not shake hands or you did not come into contact with me if I coughed or sneezed, there is no action you need to take whatsoever. If we did, however, touch or shake hands, or if I sneezed or coughed near you since Monday, it is recommended that you self-isolate for 14 days, but you do not need to get tested."
2020-03-13	(CNN) Two more Formula One races have been postponed after the Australian Grand Prix was canceled because of the continued spread of the novel coronavirus.  The race in Melbourne was scheduled as the season opener of the 2020 Formula 1 calendar, with the first practice sessions set to begin Friday.  Drivers, teams and fans had already arrived at the track for preparations, although Lewis Hamilton said in his press conference it was "shocking" the race hadn't been called off.  However, the decision to cancel the event eventually came Thursday following McLaren's withdrawal after a team member tested positive for the virus.  "We appreciate this is very disappointing news for the thousands of fans due to attend the race and all ticket holders will receive a full refund and a further announcement will be communicated in due course," read a joint statement from FIA and Formula 1, with support from race organizers.

2020-03-13	(CNN) And so it begins. In the United States, schools are starting to close, overseas travel is restricted and even Mickey Mouse has had to hang up his little white gloves -- Disneyland, too, is off limits.  But Friday, Trump called a national emergency , forced to accept that the United States won't be immune this time.  The US now has a reported 48 deaths and more than 2,100 infections, and it's beginning to look a lot like Italy on lockdown.  Now the US government has some quick and uncomfortable choices to make that could shape the health of the country in weeks from now. Many of these choices drive at the heart of what it means to be American.  Individual freedoms that many Americans hold onto so dearly will need to be compromised. Freedom of movement, to assemble and protest, and the right to privacy could be among liberties first to go in the battle to control the virus.  The sense of exceptionalism that is so engrained in the American psyche will have to be put aside. This is not a war that can be won by the world's most powerful military or bought by the world's biggest economy.  The country will be forced to adopt some sense of equality in its stratified health care system to effectively contain, or even slow, the viral spread across different people in all sorts of different groups.  Luck has played a major part in how some countries has fared with the virus so far, and if the US has any luck in this case, it is that its exposure to the virus came a little later than others.  Other countries already in the throes of their outbreaks provide useful lessons for the United States.  Tech and testing reap results  A few pointers can be learned from how South Korea has done so well to contain the virus and, conversely, why Italy has had to resort to such a paralyzing lockdown that will have enormous consequences.  The two countries have a similar population size, both confirmed their first infections outside major cities and at around the same time, and both reported a rapid rise in cases in their initial weeks.  Today, South Korea records a minuscule death rate of less than 1%, according to World Health Organization figures, while Italy's reached over 14% on Friday, as the country reported another 250 deaths in just 24 hours. More than 1,200 people have died in Italy, which has more than 17,600 cases, officials there say. The global average death rate is currently between 3-4%.  South Korea believes its outbreak has peaked as the number of confirmed cases has slowed. The country has been perhaps the most ambitious country in tackling the virus, using smart technologies to trace, test and treat people.  Under its system of universal health care, the country has the resources to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests per day and has conducted more than 200,000 tests nationwide. Anyone referred to by a doctor or who has encountered an infected person gets that test for free.  Parts of the country have even set up drive-through testing booths , which limits face-to-face contact but makes getting tested an easy and low-risk affair.  That's one lesson the US has taken on board. Several cities have put in place drive-through testing facilities, which Trump on Friday said would be expanded to more locations across the country.  In South Korea, where there is an app for just about everything, the government can check that quarantined people are abiding by their restrictions through a smartphone app that tracks their whereabouts.  There are apps for Koreans to see how and where the virus has spread, giving them up-to-date information on what places to avoid, and even apps to show them which stores still have face masks in stock.  Don't skimp on health  Italy has been rigorously testing, which could be part of why its infection numbers are so much higher than other countries. Italy's initial problem was that it simply couldn't identify the person who first brought the virus into the country, known as Patient Zero. That made tracing who that person had come into contact with impossible.  The first confirmed case, or Patient 1, came in a hospital in the northern region of Lombardy. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte admitted that the hospital there did not follow procedure and inadvertently helped the virus spread. But this mistake, at a regional hospital, could have happened just about anywhere.  The fast-growing number of cases in Lombardy, many of which were in people who had not traveled abroad, implied that the virus had likely been there for some time, and been spreading communally, making the job of tracing who had contact with whom and when a labyrinthine task.  Italy's sluggish economy hasn't helped the situation. Poor growth and periods of recession over the past two decades have left Italy economically vulnerable. The country is often ranked among the best in the world for universal public health care, but austerity cuts have weakened that system.  The country has been desperate for more beds, face masks and ventilators to deal with the high volume of coronavirus patients.  Many Italians have criticized their leaders' slowness in taking serious measures to contain the virus, but the government would have been hesitant to impose a total lockdown, which, if prolonged, could easily plunge the country back into recession.  In both countries, good and bad luck played a part. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations, with an average age of 45.5, and the coronavirus is deadlier in the elderly. The average age in south Korea is 41.8.  In South Korea, authorities determined early that its main outbreak stemmed from one religious group in the city of Daegu. Italy still doesn't know how the coronavirus reached its shores.  And luck will play a part too in how severely the United States is hit by this pandemic. But it will need a lot more than luck to guide the country through the storm ahead.
2020-03-13	But the administration's public health experts have no idea how bad the US coronavirus outbreak will get, since bottlenecks in lab testing and faults with diagnosis kits mean they can't know how many infections there really are.  "We are flying blind," warned Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, one of many lawmakers of both parties who emerged furious from a Capitol Hill briefing Thursday with government officials about the situation.  A source inside the meeting told CNN that lawmakers were told that only 11,000 tests had been conducted, prompting many to ask why South Korea can manage to test 10,000 in a single day.  The administration has been boasting for several weeks that it is sending millions of testing kits to states and local authorities. But those officials say long waits for kits and issues with the reagent used in diagnosis mean they are able to test only the most high-risk patients. They are left in the dark about the true extent of the coronavirus' spread through the community.  "Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.  But the President's comments contradicted his own government's head of infectious disease , Dr. Anthony Fauci, who admitted on Thursday that protocols under which doctors request tests for patients were not working.  "The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now," Fauci said. "It is a failing. Let's admit it."  Ohio's director of public health, Dr. Amy Acton, warned in a news conference that a shortage of testing kits meant that it was impossible to accurately track the spread of the coronavirus through the state.  "We do have this virus amongst us in Ohio," she said, warning that once epidemiologists discover two cases of community transmission they assume that 1% of the population is already infected.  The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US has now passed 1,600, with more than 40 deaths, as more and more states declare states of emergency.  The fear of many health experts now is that the epidemic will grow so fast -- and in the dark, given the paucity of testing kits -- it will hit a peak that will all but overwhelm health services, as has happened in Italy.  Trump, however, is still pointing out that the US has lower infection rates than some other nations.  "I think we can say it for a lot of countries, for all countries hopefully. It goes away, it's going away. We want it to go away with very, very few deaths," the President said.  Worst health crisis in a 'century'  Hopefully the President is right. But his efforts to calm the markets and the American public with an Oval Office address on Wednesday evening failed spectacularly.  His message to Americans, after weeks of minimizing the pandemic, apparently to safeguard his political fortunes, contrasts sharply with the somber rhetoric of other world leaders.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson steeled his people Thursday for a harrowing period ahead.  "I've got to be clear, we've all got to be clear -- this is the worst public health crisis for a generation," Johnson said. "I must level with you, level with the British public: More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time."  In France, President Emmanuel Macron said in a live televised address that the epidemic was "the most grave public health crisis that France has known in a century."  "Despite the efforts to slow it down, the virus continues to spread and is accelerating," he added.  US stock markets appear to share that grave assessment.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed to its worst day since 1987 , dipping by 10% after a week of punishing losses, giving its own verdict on Trump's leadership.  Just a month ago, Trump was riding high after escaping impeachment and enjoying a divisive Democratic nominating race that looked set to stretch into the spring.  Now he is looking increasingly at odds with the reality of the situation. Having used up one key tool in his armory, the Oval Office address, only a display of competence by his government in fighting the epidemic seems capable of lifting the impression that he is an increasingly beleaguered President.  "There has been a sense of complacency on the part of the White House, the President in particular," David Gergen, an adviser to Republican and Democratic presidents, told CNN International.  Gergen warned that the coronavirus outbreak and its political implications was "more threatening to his presidency than impeachment."  The President, however, appeared sanguine on another issue -- his own health -- after an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro , with whom he interacted over the weekend in Florida, had tested positive for novel coronavirus.  "Let's put it this way: I am not concerned," Trump said.  'Lack of trust'  Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden sought to exploit the White House's struggles and to offer Americans a vision of an alternative president.  Biden said the crisis had "laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration."  "Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this President, fueled by the adversarial relationship with the truth he continues to have," the former vice president said in Delaware.  Among the mostly grim news on Thursday, there was one ray of light. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trump's treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, appeared to be working well together despite the estrangement between House Democrats and the White House. They spoke multiple times on the phone and the two sides were closing in on a rescue package for the battered economy.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the chamber would stay in town next week through a planned recess to work on the matter.  But the coming deal will not assuage frustration among lawmakers at the administration's botched testing approach.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said he was "absolutely appalled."  "There's still no plan, no strategy, for testing, for ventilators, for the basics that are required for people to survive," Blumenthal said. "We're talking about life and death, and there's still no plan."
2020-03-13	A version of this story appeared in the March 13 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.  (CNN) From Space Mountain to Mount Everest , New York's Broadway to the English Premier League , countries and companies across the world are ordering shutdowns to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic -- and that's just in the past 24 hours.  In the US, schools are being closed, large gatherings are being banned, and public places are being shuttered. Baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer and golf have been suspended or delayed, while Europe's richest soccer leagues have halted play as more players test positive for the virus.  Global markets suffered their worst losses yesterday since Black Monday in 1987 after the Trump administration announced a European travel ban. Investors are craving a more ambitious plan to tackle the crisis, and there are hopes that they could soon get that reassurance, as the US nears a deal on an economic aid package and central banks across Asia prepare to discuss similar relief next week.  The virus has also breached the world's inner sanctums of power, showing that no one is beyond its reach. Politicians on four continents have either tested positive for the disease or put themselves in quarantine. Many officials are now remote working -- including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who is in self-isolation after his wife contracted the virus. And there is still no coordinated global plan for how to tackle the outbreak.  As global cases top more than 130,000, the new number of cases in China dwindled into single digits today. But there are concerns about what will happen when hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens are allowed out of quarantine and back to work.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Trump worries as Congress wrangles over aid package  A day after sparking confusion with his travel ban announcement, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that anybody returning to the US from Europe would be tested for the virus. Trump's remarks yesterday were so thoroughly inaccurate it was a challenge to figure out which to fact check first, though Daniel Dale took a stab at it here  A source close to Trump, however, did tell CNN that the President is indeed concerned about coming into contact with people who have contracted the virus , including a Brazilian official who tested positive days after meeting Trump at Mar-a-Lago.  Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, Sen. Lindsey Graham , a close ally of Trump, has become the latest lawmaker to self-quarantine, as negotiators try to iron out differences on a legislative aid package for Americans that is expected to include paid leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance and free coverage for coronavirus testing.  Global stocks pull back from the edge  "Virtually everyone is scratching their heads at the moment," said Stephen Innes, global chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, reacting to signals that global stocks were pulling back from the brink after Wall Street suffered its worst day since 1987. A historic sell-off eased this morning as nervous investors looked to central banks and governments for support as the economic costs of the outbreak continued to mount, Jill Disis and Laura He write  Major indexes across Asia-Pacific plunged in early trading, prompting some exchanges to activate circuit breakers and bring trading to a temporary halt. But many benchmarks traced back some of their losses by the end of trading. US stocks futures advanced and some European markets bounced back today after their worst day in history yesterday.  Travel chaos ahead of Europe travel ban  "I see Americans crying at the airport right now worried about their jobs and coming home," said one California man who was scrambling to find flights back from Spain before Trump's travel ban on 26 European countries comes into force tonight at 11:59 p.m. ET.  The ban -- which only applies to foreign nationals, not American citizens -- has triggered widespread confusion , extortionate re-booking fees and frantic Googling.  Sports in crisis  Trump has become the first world leader to suggest postponing this summer's Olympics in Tokyo. Organizers are downsizing the torch arrival ceremony but are committed to the Games going ahead.  It's one of few major sporting events still unaffected by coronavirus fears. The PGA Tour teed off without fans, then canceled the Players Championship after one round. The decision to scrap the F1 Australia Grand Prix just before it got underway was met with boos from spectators. In the US, the NCAA canceled March Madness, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer suspended their season, and baseball's opening day was delayed.  The English Premier League suspended games today. The move came after Arsenal's manager contracted the virus and a number of clubs put their whole squads into self-isolation.  Testing and social distancing  The answer: from the early creation of test kits to their mass distribution, South Korea has taken an incredibly proactive approach, Ivan Watson writes Senegal , among the world's least developed countries, has also been hailed for its testing — scientists there have helped developed a hand-held coronavirus test kit that can produce results within 10 minutes.  In contrast, the UK announced yesterday that testing would only focus on identifying people with the virus in the hospital, as questions continue over Britain's refusal to embrace some of the mass social distancing measures embraced by other countries in Europe. Meanwhile, schools have now been shuttered in Portugal, Belgium, and France, where President Emmanuel Macron said the coronavirus epidemic was the country's "greatest health crisis in a century."  ON OUR RADAR  Will warmer weather help fight the virus? Singapore and Australia suggest maybe not.  Iran is rapidly expanding a major cemetery in Qom, the epicenter of the country's outbreak, satellite images reveal.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he expects results from his coronavirus test "in the next hours."  Nepal has canceled Mount Everest expeditions for the rest of the season.

2020-03-13	Like many other companies, Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(FCA) are encouraging employees to work from home if possible, to avoid potentially spreading or catching the coronavirus.  “If the nature of your work allows for it, we are asking all GM employees and contract workers to work remotely, beginning Monday, March 16,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in a memo to employees.  Ford and Fiat Chrysler said they are also asking employees to work from home in locations around the world. These policies may not apply in China, the companies said, because workers in that country have already been dealing with the coronavirus for months. In China, the work situation is beginning to return to normal, Ford spokesman Mark Truby said.  Of course, none of this applies to workers whose jobs involve handing tools, sorting and shipping parts, testing prototype vehicles or many other jobs can’t be done from a kitchen table. All these companies’ factories remain open and, Ford’s Truby said, product development programs remain on schedule. GM said it is adjusting work schedules for manufacturing and product development workers to allow for additional cleaning to keep the virus at bay.  Fiat Chrysler is making changes at some at its plants to deal with the coronavirus threat. One worker at Fiat Chrysler’s Kokomo, Indiana, transmission factory tested positive for the virus.  “In manufacturing, we are changing our production techniques at several plants to enable greater space between employees at work-stations,” FCA CEO Mike Manley said in a note to employees.  Car dealerships are almost all independent businesses and are not owned by car manufacturers so these policies don’t apply to them. Dealerships will be dealing with this situation in their own ways.
2020-03-13	(CNN) CNN readers are asking smart questions about coronavirus every day. So each weekday, we'll select some of the top questions and get you the answers .  Here are some of the most popular recent questions:  Q. If I get a pneumonia vaccine, will that help protect me from coronavirus?  Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won't help.  "Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections," according to Harvard Medical School  "They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia."  It's similar to why antibiotics won't help treat coronavirus or any other virus.  Scientists are working on a vaccine for coronavirus, but it will be more than a year before it could become available.  The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus, but it does help protect against a massive and unnecessary burden on hospitals as health care workers tackle coronavirus.  Q. Can I have the flu and coronavirus at the same time? If I test positive for the flu, does that mean I don't have coronavirus?  Lots of readers are asking this, since it's difficult to get coronavirus testing in many areas.  But there's no reason why you can't have both the flu and coronavirus. So a positive test for the flu doesn't mean you can't have coronavirus as well.  The flu and coronavirus do share some common symptoms -- especially fever and cough. But many coronavirus patients suffer from shortness of breath.  Of course, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all. And asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus to others.  One big reason why health officials are worried about this novel coronavirus is because it only emerged in humans over the past few months. That means no one had antibodies to fight off the virus.  Q. Why is the US so far behind other countries with coronavirus testing?  There are a few factors, said Dr. Rob Davidson , an emergency room doctor and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.  "The public health infrastructure and the response to outbreaks and the National Security Council have been gutted by this administration," Davidson said.  Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China, after the Trump administration refused to reallocate money to a program that started during the government's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak.  At that time, former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said the move "would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world."  Another factor involves the tests themselves -- including malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability.  In the first few weeks of coronavirus in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results.  "We had the ability about five weeks ago to use a WHO -- World Health Organization -- approved test that's been used in other countries that was available, and that was rejected so we could use a test that was developed here," Davidson said.  After test kits were later sent across the country, some were flawed . "So they go back to the drawing board," Davidson said. "It put us behind by about four or five weeks."  Q. Should I start keeping extra food and supplies?  Yes, because you or a family member might suddenly have to quarantine. But it's a good idea to always have extra food and medication anyway.  "Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home," Harvard Medical School says. "These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms."  In addition, try to keep at least a 30-day supply of prescription medication and any needed over-the-counter medication.  Q. Will spraying yourself or your children with disinfectant help?  A viral video from CNN affiliate WHBQ showed a man spraying a student with what appeared to be disinfectant spray after school.  But spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body "will not kill viruses that have already entered your body," the World Health Organization says.  "Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations."  Q. Why can't we make a drug to treat coronavirus faster?  An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus's life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to Harvard Medical School  "In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive."  Have a question about coronavirus? Ask us here.  Looking for more answers? Check us out here.
2020-03-13	(CNN) As Covid-19 spreads with alacrity around the world, billion-dollar sports leagues have been brought to a halt.  Thursday in the US was one of the most extraordinary in the country's sports history as the NBA, the WNBA and the much-anticipated NCAA's men's and women's basketball tournaments were among the major events suspended or postponed.  Competitions once regarded as shatterproof have been affected. The English Premier League, often described as the world's richest soccer league, on Friday announced a suspension.  But the Olympic Games , the biggest sporting spectacle of all, is still set to go ahead, which begs the question: with society shutting down as a result of a worldwide pandemic, will the Olympics really be held in Tokyo this summer?  What has been said?  On Saturday, Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Olympics will go ahead, while the day before Japan's Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto had dismissed suggestions that Tokyo 2020 should be postponed.  Responding to comments made by US President Donald Trump, who had suggested the Games should be rescheduled, Hashimoto said neither the local organizing committee or the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had considered postponing or canceling the Games.  "We continue to proceed preparations to hold a safe and secure Games that will open on July 24," said Hashimoto.  On March 12, the day the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia without spectators because of ongoing concerns over COVID-19, the IOC said it was "fully committed" to holding the Games, set to run from July 24 to August 9, in Tokyo.  "Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games we are strengthened in our commitment by many organizations around the world taking significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus," Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said.  Much is still unknown  The coronavirus has infected more than 132,500 people and killed nearly 5,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization.  COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, but much remains unknown about it.  Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared with neighboring South Korea and China. However, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.  The country experienced an uptick in numbers on Tuesday, with 54 more cases reported -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.  And Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak, specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.  A woman wearing a face mask walks past the Olympic rings in front of the new National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020.  Health experts have also previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus.  Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the "tip of the iceberg."  This week the country canceled the annual public service in Tokyo which marks the Fukushima disaster.  The start of the baseball, football and rugby sevens seasons have already been delayed, while a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka last weekend was held without spectators for the first time in its history.  With the Games still scheduled to go ahead, the outbreak in Japan and the government's handling of it will continue to be under heightened scrutiny.  What are the options for Tokyo 2020?  If the Games were being held now, it would be difficult to imagine how organizers could go ahead as planned. Thousands of people converging in Tokyo during a pandemic would surely not be countenanced.  But Tokyo 2020 has time. Experts hope warmer weather will help fight the virus, though it is yet unclear whether that theory is true.  The Olympic movement essentially has two opportunities to make money, at the Summer Games and the Winter Olympics, so with billions of dollars at stake, in ticket sales, hospitality and sponsorship especially, organizers are as yet unwilling to contemplate a delay or cancellation.  With the authority to cancel the Games, it is the IOC which is in control. Earlier this month, IOC member Dick Pound admitted a decision to cancel could be made as late as May.  The situation remains fluid and talk of holding the Games elsewhere has been widely quashed. As Professor Victor Matheson, a sports economist who has written on the economics of the Olympics, told CNN Sport: "Any world where Japan is too unsafe to hold the Olympics, London is also too unsafe to hold the Olympics."  It is widely regarded that the options available are: to hope the outbreak eases and go ahead as planned, to hold the Games without spectators, to postpone or cancel completely.  The economic costs of Tokyo 2020  Canceling the Games would be unprecedented in peacetime.  The cost of hosting, organizers said in December, was some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) but, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat.  According to Reuters, Japan's Board of Audit put government spending on the Games between 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81billion). Sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games.  Professor Matheson believes the truer sum is likely to be $25 billion, a vast majority of which has already been spent on large-scale infrastructure projects such as transportation networks, hotels and new venues.  "Whether the Games go on or not, most of this investment is a sunk cost at this point," Professor Matheson said.  "If you were to cancel the Olympics, you would be able to avoid some of the costs, such as billion dollars of security, if Tokyo's security costs were similar to London, but the biggest cost is all of the infrastructure and most of that spending has already taken place."  A general view of the Olympic rings as they are illuminated for the first time to mark 6 months to go to the Olympic games at Odaiba Marine Park on January 24, 2020.  If the Tokyo 2020 was canceled, who'd be the losers?  Professor Matheson points to the IOC and the local organizing committee as being among the biggest losers in the event of cancellation, though both organizations will be insured.  "This isn't Delta Airlines, where we cancel a bunch of flights but once we solve the problem things are back to normal," he said, describing the Olympics as "totally non-diversified."  Another big loser would be Tokyo's hospitality industry.  "If we look at other host cities, the total number of international tourists was likely to increase by 100,000 visitors and those visitors were paying much higher room rental rates than the people they would have been replacing," said Matheson.  "That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry and that's probably not insurable."  And then there are the sponsors, Matheson adds: "If the Games don't go on at all, there are $3 billion worth of sponsorships that have been purchased and it's hard to know where that money goes if the Games don't all go on.  "That is a loss to someone, that's either a loss to broadcasters or it's a loss to the IOC, because they don't get the revenue from the contract, or it's a loss to an insurer.  "Somewhere along the line you have this valuable product that was going to produce all this TV entertainment and someone's going to lose that revenue somewhere."  Japan's GDP, however, would not take a significant hit, said Matheson.  "In any scenario where the Olympic Games are canceled, the other costs associated with coronavirus are going to make the Olympic costs seem like a drop in the bucket."  What is the least costly alternative for the IOC?  Postponing the Games by a few months has been mentioned as an option for the IOC should it be deemed unsafe for the Games to go ahead as scheduled.  But TV rights holders would be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US and the European soccer season.  After all, the Games are being held in August, despite the potential dangers the scorching weather could pose to athletes, because the wants of rights holders far outweighs that of the athletes.  If the show was unable to go on as planned, holding the Games this summer without spectators would be the least costly, according to Matheson.  Sponsors, athletes, and TV rightsholders would still have an Olympics, he said, with Japan's tourism sector being the biggest loser.  "You still need the athletes and production officials, which may still be too many people in one place during a severe outbreak. It would cost you all your tourism money and about a billion dollars in ticket revenue," said Matheson.  "But you still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money.  "It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues. Postponing it by a year would be massively costly, this would be multibillions of dollars, but at least you would have all your revenue streams intact that year later."  The National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R).  What about the athletes?  Competing at the Olympics is the pinnacle for the majority of athletes taking part. Sacrifices have been made, lives put on hold, training sessions meticulously planned for a career-defining moment.  If the Games were to be canceled, so too would an athlete's shot at glory. Gone would be the opportunity to become an Olympic champion and the sponsorship opportunities that come with that. Then, there are the older athletes, those who have one final chance at greatness. There is an economic cost, and a human one too.  There are also the athletes who have yet to secure qualification. Athletes needing to improve their rankings may miss out completely because qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, has been moved from April to June.  Simone Biles is expected to be one of the star athletes at Tokyo 2020  Dave Hembrough, Sheffield Hallam University's lead for strength and conditioning, told CNN Sport said that while athletes were resilient the uncertainty would be disruptive, especially to those attempting to qualify and attending training camps.  "Those who are the best in the world will be so driven for the purpose of being the best, it won't disturb them much," he said.  "But if athletes don't qualify, they don't compete and it might lead to organizations not having the best athletes qualifying and, therefore, reducing the chance of winning medals.  "I'm involved with British weightlifting ... one of the things people are concerned with is the financial commitment of signing up for camps for competition, travel for hotels that are then going to be subsequently canceled. A lot of organizations cannot afford that."  What happens next?  On Friday, the Greek Olympic Committee (HOC) suspended the remainder of the Olympic torch relay through the country to avoid attracting crowds. The decision was made in agreement with the health ministry and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).  The handover of the flame to Tokyo 2020 Games organizers is still set to take place as scheduled at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on March 19 without spectators.  But whether Tokyo's Olympic cauldron will be lit in July remains, much like the virus, unknown.
2020-03-13	(CNN) — As coronavirus spreads across the globe, thousands of travelers are canceling their reservations and choosing to stay home.  On Friday, March 13, the vacation rental company Airbnb announced changes to its extenuating circumstances policy, allowing travelers to cancel their reservations penalty-free.  Now, more travelers will qualify for penalty-free refunds for bookings. Here's what you need to know about booking with Airbnb:  What is the extenuating circumstances policy?  When a traveler books with Airbnb, their reservation comes with one of six cancellation policies , ranging from flexible to super strict. These are set by the host.  However, the company has announced that some Covid-19-related cancellations may qualify for refunds under the Extenuating Circumstances Policy.  When the website recognizes that travelers are going to or coming from certain affected areas, an automatic message will be generated offering the chance to cancel without a penalty.  Even if travelers don't receive an automated message, they may still cancel their booking, then submit a request for a refund within 14 days of cancellation.  Bookings in the United States and Europe  Now, travelers with bookings in the United States made on or before March 13, with a check-in date of April 1 or earlier, are eligible for penalty-free cancellations.  Travelers coming from the United States with a booking in Europe's Schengen Area are also eligible.  This applies to reservations booked on or before March 11, for travel dates between March 13 and April 13.  The Schengen Area is a group of 26 European countries that extend visa-free travel to their citizens. Ireland and the United Kingdom are not in the Schengen Area, and Airbnb has not announced whether they will be covered by the new policy.  While Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein are not in the European Union, they are in the Schengen Area; travelers with reservations in these countries are eligible for penalty-free bookings.  In a previous announcement, Airbnb stated that guests with reservations in Italy made on or before February 29, with a check-in date of April 2 or before, were eligible for a penalty-free refund.  Bookings in China and South Korea  A previous statement announced that reservations in mainland China booked on or before January 28, with a check in date of April 1 or before, would qualify for penalty-free bookings under the extenuating circumstances policy.  For travelers coming from mainland China, penalty-free cancellations are available for reservations booked on or before February 1 that have a check-in date of April 1 or before.  Related content Airlines extend waivers, adjust schedules for Europe travel ban  Travelers with reservations in South Korea booked on or before February 25 are eligible for penalty-free cancellations if their check-in date is March 23 or before.  If you're coming from South Korea, you may also cancel some bookings penalty free. Reservations are eligible if they were booked on or before February 25, with a check-in date of March 23 or before.  What about special circumstances?  Even if you're not coming from or going to an area that automatically qualifies for a refund, though, it might be possible to get your money back.  The extenuating circumstances policy applies to hosts or guests who must cancel for some other reasons, as well.  Penalty-free refunds will be extended to any hosts or guests who must cancel reservations to comply with disease control restrictions, or to perform coronavirus-related medical or disease-control duties.  If your flight or ground transportation is cancelled by the carrier due to Covid-19, your reservation qualifies for a penalty-free refund.
2020-03-14	There have now been more cases of the novel coronavirus outside of mainland China than inside, according to numbers from the World Health Organization and from public health agencies tracked by CNN.  While China, the early epicenter of the outbreak, has still had more confirmed cases than any other country – more than 80,000 – a number of other countries have surged in recent days, including Italy with more than 24,000 cases, Iran with almost 14,000 and Spain with more than 7,000.  On February 26, the World Health Organization reported for the first time that the majority of new cases per day had come from outside of China. This trend has continued as newly confirmed cases in China have dwindled in recent days, while other countries have discovered thousands of new infections – including the United States, which has now reported more than 3,000 cases.
2020-03-14	Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University. His new book is "Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.  (CNN) President Donald Trump's press conference in the White House Rose Garden Friday afternoon with key members of his coronavirus task force was a reassuring affair after his disastrous Oval Office address on Wednesday night. Trump offered some realistic policy prescriptions and, for the most part, showed a more somber and well-informed view of the potential threat the pandemic poses.  Let's take some of the smart policy calls first: Trump declared a national emergency that he said would allow states and other localities to access up to $50 billion to help combat the spread of the virus.  The president and his task force also announced public-private partnerships with commercial laboratories to produce far more coronavirus tests, which will be made available at drive-in testing sites at Walgreens, Walmart and CVS. According to Dr. Deborah Birx, a task force member, these new tests could deliver results in 24 hours instead of several days. The plan to bring millions of new tests to the market sounded promising, although it wasn't clear from the press conference exactly how soon it would be implemented.  This is all potentially very good news, as the track record for tests so far in the United States has been dismal. In the weeks since COVID-19 first appeared in the US, the CDC has, as of Friday, tested a grand total of 3,958 individuals, while other public health laboratories around the country tested 12,584 cases.  Meanwhile, South Korea has the capability to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests in a single day. It has tested about 230,000 people -- around 15 times more than the US -- even though its population is about 15% that of the US.  When Trump was asked about the lack of testing, he failed to show any accountability, blaming past administrations instead.  "I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time," he responded.  Trump and his task force also announced that visits to nursing homes would be suspended with exceptions including "end-of-life situations." This is a sensible plan given the vulnerability of nursing home populations, as we have seen in Washington state  Friday's press conference also had some decidedly mixed messages: President Trump trumpeted the progress that had been made fighting the coronavirus and uttered some predictable odes to himself, saying, "We're doing a great job."  At the podium, Trump shook hands with two of the business leaders who spoke at the press conference -- despite the CDC's advice to avoid doing so. The president also said he would not self-isolate after coming in contact with a Brazilian official who visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend and later tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump said he would likely get tested "fairly soon" when pressed on the matter. (On Saturday, Trump confirmed he had been tested and would have the results in a day or two .) Regardless, the president did not seem to model the most responsible behavior.  When asked why the White House had closed its pandemic office in 2018, Trump passed the buck saying, "I don't know anything about it." This is either a fib since it's been widely reported on, or a sign of the president's ignorance.  Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence outdid his usual genuflections to the Dear Leader by peppering his remarks with asides like, "Mr. President, from early on you took decisive action."  While these rhetorical flourishes are merely annoying, Pence also said that the "risk of serious illness remains low" to Americans. Well, it depends on your definition of "low": An analysis of 44,000 coronavirus patients in China found that 14% had severe cases and 5% were critical. The fatality rate was 2.3%. Nearly 1 in 5 who had contracted the virus either became seriously ill or died.  And when Dr. Anthony Fauci, Trump's top infectious disease adviser, was asked to estimate the duration of the coronavirus crisis, his optimistic projection was eight or nine weeks. He explained that it was hard to estimate, with figures depending heavily on containment and mitigation efforts. Even Trump conceded, "The next eight weeks are critical."  But President Trump also continued to downplay the severity of the pandemic. At one point, he said that there would be five million coronavirus tests available within a month, before going on to add, "I doubt we'll need anywhere near that."

In fact, on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel , a scientist herself and the kind of sober leader we need right now, publicly said that 60-70% of the German population would get the virus.  In short, Friday's press conference was not the calamity of Trump's Oval Office address two days earlier, but it still revealed a president who trusts his gut that this crisis will somehow blow over, even though as of now, there is scant evidence that is the case.  This article has been updated to reflect the latest news that President Trump has been tested for the coronavirus.
2020-03-14	New York State Assembly members Helene Weinstein and Charles Barron have both tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo Saturday.  "It is important to note that both members have not been in Albany since early March for separate reasons," Cuomo's statement read.  The Capital and Legislative Office Building will undergo "an intensive cleaning," Cuomo said, and all legislators who came in contact with Weinstein and Barron will be tested.  "Additionally, out of an abundance of caution we are closing the Capitol to visitors effective tomorrow," Cuomo said.

2020-03-15	(CNN) — As Americans are being urged to keep their distance from one another, travelers returning on flights from Europe say they are being made to wait for hours in close quarters at US airports to get screened for coronavirus.  When they arrived in Dallas, Chicago and New York, they faced long lines and confusion, several travelers told CNN. At one New York airport, two travelers said they were alarmed when officials suggested they should share pens to fill out customs and medical forms.  President Donald Trump has announced foreign nationals in 26 European countries will face restrictions entering the US, while Ireland and the United Kingdom will be added to the list at midnight Monday.  Trump tweeted Sunday, asking those stuck at airports to be patient : "We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!"  Authorities have increased staff to affected airports to speed up wait times, Customs and Border Patrol Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement released Sunday night.  "CBP has increased staffing at all locations to process travelers impacted by the proclamation as well as refined the screening process logistics to ease impacts caused by the large volume of travelers requiring enhanced health screening," Morgan said. "Implementing these measures helped reduce the wait times."  The travel ban went into effect at midnight Friday, but only after the original announcement sparked chaos at European airports as Americans sought ways to return home before it went into place.  Director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci tells CNN's Brianna Keilar that he would like to see people avoid crowds and says those trying to return to the US from overseas should not all return immediately.  American citizens and permanent residents are allowed to fly into the US but must to go through one of 13 transit airports for screening, which caused backups at some of the airports.  Karen Rogers, a passenger returning from Paris by way of London, had been waiting in line for at least five hours to be screened at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and was told she would have at least another hour to go, she said Saturday night.  CNN has reached out to O'Hare International Airport but did not receive an immediate response.  US Customs and Border Protection is aware of the long lines and is already seeing success addressing the delays at some airports, acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement emphasizing that passengers' safety and health is the top priority.  In a later statement Sunday, he said, "Wait times experienced yesterday at some locations were unacceptable."  The agency's partners' resources are "stretched thin," he said, and CBP still must fulfill its national security, counter-narcotics and outbound enforcement missions.  "With this national emergency, there will unfortunately be times of disruption and increased processing times for travelers. CBP is working around the clock to minimize these inconveniences," he said.  'Very close quarters'  The process in place at O'Hare has passengers "essentially go(ing) through customs twice," said Ann Lewis Schmidt, a passenger returning from Iceland.  Passengers first wait in line to have their passports checked and to turn in a declaration form and medical forms for those returning from Europe, South Korea, Iran and China, Schmidt said.  Then they are taken to a separate line to undergo a screening and temperature check.  Passengers are grouped together for hours during the process, Schmidt said.  "Seems backwards, as if someone had a fever they should have been never allowed in these lines for four hours," Schmidt told CNN.  She described folks being in "very close quarters ... so if we didn't have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!"  Travelers who pass the screening are instructed to immediately self-quarantine at home and monitor their health as outlined in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's best practices, the Department of Homeland Security said.  Illinois governor calls on federal government to take action  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker reacted to the long lines by tweeting to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, "The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW."  Speaking to NBC, Pritzker said he is working with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois lawmakers to push the federal government to take action to alleviate issues at O'Hare, he said.  The government, in announcing travel restrictions for Europe, should have increased the number of customs and CDC officials on the ground at airports, but "they did neither of those," he told NBC.  "So last night, as people were flooding into O'Hare airport, they were stuck in a small area -- hundreds and hundreds of people -- and that's exactly what you don't want in this pandemic," he told the news outlet Sunday. "Then today, it's going to be even worse. There are a larger number of flights with more people coming, and they seem completely unprepared."  Lightfoot blasted the US government's "lack of preparedness" regarding the airport screening procedures, telling reporters it "seriously compromised" travelers, some 3,000 of whom were in concourses at O'Hare awaiting processing Sunday afternoon.  "You must listen to mayors and governors and other local officials first," Lightfoot said before citing federal immigration efforts in her city. "Rather than sending (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) into the streets, send screeners to our airports."  In a tweet, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf acknowledged the long lines and the stress passengers were experiencing.  "DHS is aware of the long lines for passengers who are undergoing increased medical screening requirements. Right now we are working to add additional screening capacity and working with the airlines to expedite the process," he said.  "I understand this is very stressful. In these unprecedented times, we ask for your patience. It currently takes ~60 seconds for medical professionals to screen each passenger. We will be increasing capacity but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost."  Passengers told to share pens  At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, passengers are also facing long wait times.  Katelyn Deibler landed at JFK from Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday afternoon and it took more than two hours to complete customs, she said.  She was given two forms to fill out when she arrived, she said.  "One was just name, passport number, flight number, seat, address, emergency contact, and details about your trip," Deibler said.  Travelers returning on flights from Europe say they are being made to wait for hours in close quarters at US airports to get screened for coronavirus.  The second form asked specific questions about symptoms and travel to coronavirus hot zones, she said.  The form instructs passengers to circle countries they visited in the last 14 days and asks if they've had any symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing, Deibler said.  There were not enough copies for all the passengers on the flight, and many had to wait for more forms to be handed out.  "They didn't have pens and told us to share," she said. "Which sounds like a great thing in the middle of the pandemic."  Three taken to the hospital after screenings at JFK  Another traveler, Nick Carlin, expressed concern passengers were told to share pens, and there was no hand sanitizer at JFK, he said.  "It definitely was a little scattered and disorganized," said Chris Nadolne, a passenger who arrived to JFK. "I can see how people would start to get frustrated as the line got longer. ... No bathrooms nearby and no antibacterial around for people to use -- unlike in the UK and Paris where it is everywhere."  At least three passengers who underwent screenings at JFK were sent to hospitals because of their symptoms, a source with knowledge of the JFK screenings said.  The average wait time for a health screening has been two hours, said Frank Russo, the JFK port director for US Customs and Border Control. There are more than 50 emergency medical technicians on duty supplementing CDC staff, he said.  Asked about passengers' complaints of the airport lacking hand sanitizer, he said the terminals have hand sanitizer and officers are instructing people how to find it. He has asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the airport -- to install more dispensers in the areas where passengers are waiting, he said.  Passengers were intermingling while waiting in lines  Upon landing at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , Kimberly Harris witnessed passengers who were in line for CDC screening skip the queue and join international passengers who did not need to be screened, she said. Harris returned from Johannesburg, South Africa, via London.  She watched the customs line grow and wrap around the entire floor, she said. "It was difficult to tell where the line began and ended," Harris said. "It almost (was) immediately evident that people who had to stay behind on the plane due to visiting a listed country were integrated into the line of the people who did not require additional screening."  CNN's Anna Stewart walks through the thinking you'll need to go through before you decide if you should continue with your travel plans in light of coronavirus.  It took her three hours to make it through passport control and customs, she said. Another passenger who arrived at DFW on Sunday from Thailand by way of Doha, Qatar, described a similar scene. The coronavirus screening line was not separated from the other international arrivals, Matthew Thomas said.  "(They were) right next to us," he says. "We were crowded and there for hours."  Neither Thomas nor Harris required screenings.
2020-03-15	Never mind that Australia's toilet paper supply is plentiful, that the Singaporean has no links to the virus and that not a single passenger on the Princess cruise ship that docked in Reunion was infected.  Irrational and selfish incidents like these are likely the exception, not the rule, but an everyone-for-themselves mentality -- or each family, even each country -- appears to be growing, putting into question the world's ability to unite and slow the coronavirus' spread.  Leaders of affected nations are scrambling to seize some control of the situation. They impose restrictive measures in their countries, inject money into their economies, and promise their health systems will somehow find the extra beds, doctors and nurses they will inevitably need.  Yet there seems to be little coordination between countries to address what is by nature a global challenge.  Face masks on the production line at a Moldex-Metric factory in Walddorfhaeslach, Germany, on Thursday.  Face masks around the world are running out, as people who don't need them hoard them. The US is stockpiling them, while South Korea, Germany and Russia, among others, have banned their export, to ensure their own people have enough.  India, which makes 20% of the world's medicinal drugs by volume, has halted certain medicines from being exported. Yes, it is unable to source enough ingredients from China and can't make its usual output, but it is also likely keeping them for its own people.  Populists point the finger  This pandemic has now claimed more than 5,000 lives, infected over 150,000 people and touched every continent, save for Antarctica, as it crosses geographical borders that have politically closed.  European leaders have met several times and it was only on Tuesday that they finally announced some coordinated action. It was aimed primarily at economic stimulus, rather than devising a much-needed gameplan to slow the virus' spread across the region.  There is serious doubt that the usual economic tools will even work. During a health crisis, injecting money into economies doesn't necessarily get people spending. Consumers travel and shop less, and on the supply side, factories and businesses are closing in countries like China, Japan, South Korea and Italy.  Italy, the worst-affected country outside China, complained the EU had been too slow to help, as it desperately needed more surgical masks and ventilators for patients, which it is now relying on China to provide.  A shopper passes empty shelves usually stocked with toilet paper in Melbourne, Australia, on March 5.  EU leaders have chastized member countries for clinging to protective gear like face masks, as the 27-country bloc is supposed to be united and enjoy free trade.  The pandemic comes at a time when the world was already questioning globalization, emboldening anti-globalization arguments and the populist parties seeking greater isolation.  Italian far-right opposition leader Matteo Salvini called recently for the country to close its border.  "The infection is spreading. I want to know from the government who has come in and gone out. We have to seal our borders now," he said in a video on Facebook in late February.  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday framed the outbreak as a "foreign virus," blaming Europe for failing to act quickly enough, as he announced sharp restrictions on travel from more than two dozen European countries. On Saturday the ban was extended to the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Why humans can be selfish and irrational  Much of this each-for-their-own behavior comes from humans' tendency to trust their feelings over facts, a way of thinking that is "evolutionarily ancient," according to Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon psychologist, who studies risk perception.  There are two main modes of thinking, he explains: one an intuitive sense based on feelings, the other a more rational sense based on scientific reasoning, evidence and reason. It is the intuitive mode that dominates, according to Slovic.  "In the earliest days when we were evolving, there were plenty of dangers around, and those dangers were directly experienced, they were threats that we faced directly from threatening creatures or other tribes, it was all very direct and concrete. So these reactions based on feelings were very beneficial in helping us act quickly and to recognize friend from foe, it was us against them," Slovic told CNN.  "Like if you heard a sound in the bush that might be a dangerous animal, you didn't stop to reason about what was causing the sound -- was it really a dangerous animal? -- you just accepted the fact that it sounded scary and you got out of there. You moved fast. So our survival depended on testing your emotions and behaving quickly, and acting according to those feelings."  Feelings, he said, are usually a useful guide that helps us make good decisions every day.  "It's easy, it's natural, fast -- it's a remarkable capability in our modern brain, except there are a few things it doesn't do well, and one of those things is it doesn't relate to statistics, or numbers, very well."  This is playing out in the current pandemic, he said, as most of the information received through the media and officials are of the worst cases and fatalities. We aren't computing well that the vast majority of cases are mild, even asymptomatic.  It's unsurprising that some people might feel threatened by someone who comes from Wuhan, where the virus originated, or China, or another country that is prevalent, he said, because of the way the mind works.  "It's a natural, protective response, which can be exaggerated and harmful to people who pose really a very low risk," he said.  "But it's an emotion that should be tempered by reason -- we should say, what do we know about the probability that this group of people is really going to harm us in some way? What's the severity of it? What does the data show? What does it say about the level of risk? What we see is that stigma can occur even when the risk is very low and the stigma is not warranted."

Hide Caption 60 of 60  Actually, stockpiling isn't always irrational  The world is not doomed quite yet. For all the examples of anti-social behavior, there has been pro-social action.  We can feel heartened by the doctors, nurses and other medical staff who are still showing up to work, often on the front lines, risking their own health for the greater good.  Cleaners are still working at offices, on trains and in schools and nurseries, doing their part in keeping people safe.  People are taking hand washing and sanitizing seriously -- the sellout of hand gels around the world is testament to that -- to prevent communal spread of the virus.  And stockpiling groceries may not be as selfish as it seems, according to techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina.  Preparing for the virus "is one of the most pro-social, altruistic things you can do in response to potential disruptions of this kind," she wrote in Scientific American  She argues that being ready with grocery items at home could help stem the virus' spread, if it means not needing to go out to supermarkets and if those stocks can be shared with more vulnerable neighbors who may be less organized. Keeping in good health and getting a flu shot will help keep pressure off healthcare systems, she said.  This pro-social behavior has happened in the past. World War II may have been the worst display of humanity in modern history, but it was also a time where much of the world banded together to fight a common cause.  It involved an extraordinary marshaling of resources and sharing of information, both between individuals and countries. Soldiers were often sent to fight on foreign fronts to support allies, even in cases where their own nations were not directly under threat.  Susan Michie, a health psychologist at the University College London who specializes in behavioral change, says that most people are inclined to act in pro-social ways when faced with a threat, as long as they feel they can rely on governments and society to provide for them and treat them equally.  "The problems arise when the demand for healthcare or food or medicine exceeds the resources," she said.  "The last time in the UK felt this kind of threat was in World War II, and in fact, people were healthier than they had been for a long time -- there were rations, and distributed much more equally. People really went the extra mile to help," she said.  "It's a very good example of 'We're all in this together.' Then you were fighting a common enemy and now we are also fighting a common enemy, with this virus. We need to get that idea into the collective mentality."
2020-03-15	New York (CNN Business) A growing number of retailers have announced they are temporarily closing stores in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus .  and more have announced that they are shuttering many or all of their retail stores around the globe through late Marchbecause of coronavirus. They followed makeup brand Glossier and outdoor brand Patagonia, which on Thursday and Friday were among the first consumer goods retailers to announce temporary store closures.  The companies all stressed that their online stores would remain open, though some, including Patagonia, have said shipments could be delayed as employees work remotely.  President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus on Friday. As of Saturday, nearly 3,000 coronavirus cases had been reported in the United States, while more than 152,000 cases have been reported globally . Health experts have encouraged people to respond by practicing "social distancing," which includes avoiding large gatherings and maintaining a physical distance of about six feet from other people.  "What we've learned together (in China) has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response," Apple said in a statement Friday. "One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus's transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we're taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers."  Many retailers have also closed offices and asked employees who work in other parts of the business to work from home.  Kroger KR Walmart WMT Some of the largest grocery chains in the United States -— including, Publix and— have also announced reduced store hours in response to the outbreak.  Starbucks SBUX Similarly,said Sunday it is moving to a "to-go" model, pausing all in-store seating and encouraging the use of its app to order ahead, at most company owned stores in the United States and Canada for at least two weeks.  What will the closures mean?  Retailers' sales are likely to take a hit from the closures.  Nike, for example, has more than 1,100 branded stores globally and nearly all of the company's growth last year came from direct to consumer sales at its Nike retail stores, factory outlets and Nike.com, according to NPD analyst Matt Powell.  Powell said that while "some of the closed store sales could be realized in Nike's wholesale partners and on Nike.com," Nike will likely "see a negative sales impact from these closures."  But while retailers may suffer financially in the short term, the closures are a smart long term business decision, said Susquehanna International Group senior analyst Sam Poser.  "It's an unfortunate but very necessary decision," Poser said.  "How important are a few days of business versus the health of your people, the health of your employees and customers, and your brand reputation? ... You want to be around and strong, with your people and your customers, when the dust settles."  The situation is similar for Apple, which had already been feeling the negative impact of stores in China that closed last month and only just reopened, as well as supply chain issues caused by the outbreak in China.  "At this point, the March quarter is going to be an iPhone (sales) number that's as doomsday as you could imagine ... At this point, investors have accepted that the March quarter is really a write off," said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.  However, Ives said, as a "global brand" and "business leader," it is essential for Apple to prioritize the health of its employees and customers above short term profits. And the 5G iPhone on the horizon should help the company bounce back in the coming year.  Retailers with a smaller brick-and-mortar footprint, like Everlane, have also closed physical stores until late March. Here's a roundup of some of the larger brands.  Retailers that have announced store closures:  Glossier:  All stores closed as of March 12, for at least the next two weeks.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay for the two week scheduled closure.  The company has also delayed the opening of its new Arizona store, which was scheduled for this upcoming Wednesday.  Patagonia:  All stores closed as of March 13. The company said it will reassess the situation and post an update on March 27.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  Neighborhood Goods:  All stores closed as of March 13, through at least March 27.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  Urban Outfitters:  All stores globally closed as of March 14, through at least March 28.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  Includes the company's other brands: Anthropologie, BHLDN, Free People, Terrain and Nuuly.  Apple:  All stores outside of the Greater China region closed as of March 14, through March 27.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  Stores in Greater China have reopened.  Nike:  All stores in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand will be closed March 16 through March 27.  Stores in South Korea, Japan, most of China and many other countries remain open.  Hourly employees affected by store closures will continue to receive their regular pay.  Abercrombie & Fitch:  All stores outside of the Asia Pacific region will be closed through March 28. Store closures in North America will begin March 15. Store closures in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will begin March 16.  Includes the company's other brand Hollister Co.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  The company also withdrew its first quarter and full year 2020 guidance on Sunday due to the uncertainty caused by coronavirus.  Lush Cosmetics:  All 258 retail stores across the United States and Canada will be closed from March 16 through March 29. Corporate employees at Lush's headquarters in North America are also being asked to work from home if their jobs allow through the end of the month.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  The company said it will also be forced to "significantly scale down our manufacturing and distribution operations" for the duration of the store closures.  Starbucks:  Instituting a "to-go" model in most company owned stores in the United States and Canada for at least two weeks. That means cafe and patio seating areas will be closed, though customers can still order at the counter, through the app and via the drive through. Stores will have modified condiment bars.  Some stores in busy areas, such as university campuses, will be closed, and stores in areas with high concentrations of coronavirus cases will be closed or have reduced hours.  REI:  Closing all 162 stores in the United States from March 16 through March 27.  Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.  Offering free shipping on all online orders.

2020-03-15	(CNN) From behind the big oak desk in the Oval Office, the most solemn setting in times of national emergency, President Donald Trump somberly addressed the public.  Americans desperately needed reassurances about the rapidly spreading novel coronavirus . After all, it was now official: The virus had touched every continent except for Antarctica. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. It had killed dozens and infected thousands of Americans, shut down schools, universities and businesses across the country and begun to sow widespread fear, despite Trump's assertion in late Februarythat "like a miracle, it will disappear."  "The virus will not have a chance against us," the President read from the teleprompter Wednesday night, announcing a ban on most travel from Europe and painting a rosy picture of the tanking economy.  Around that same time, more than 1,300 miles away, NBA fans packed Oklahoma City's Chesapeake Energy Arena. Some chanted, "O-K-C! O-K-C!" The Jazz were about to tip off against the Thunder.  But amid the pregame fervor, team officials huddled with the refs. With each minute of the delay, the crowd grew restless. Soon, players from both teams -- some waving at fans -- left for the locker rooms. A smattering of boos rose from the stands.  "Fans, due to unforeseen circumstances the game tonight has been postponed," the public address announcer told the crowd.  The alert was vague. But soon came news that a Utah Jazz player had tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting the league to suspend the remainder of its season. Within a day, the NCAA's March Madness tournaments , Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and others would follow suit.

Coronavirus had infected a man from Snohomish County in western Washington state. He had arrived from Wuhan, China -- where the virus first appeared in late December-- at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15, before the mandatory health screenings started at US airports. He sought medical care on January 19, after four days of self-quarantine at home.  That first victim, a man in his 50s, had underlying health conditions. He appeared to become ill as the virus spread in the community. There was no evidence the patient had close contact with an infected person or a travel history that would have exposed him, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Two other cases were connected to the Life Care Center, a nursing and rehab facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. It would become an epicenter of the US outbreak , with at least 19 deaths. Relatives and friends of the 108 patients were barred from visiting -- a policy that soon spread across the country.  One case from the center involved a health care worker, in her 40s , who had no relevant travel history. Another was a center resident in her 70s.

Now, nursing homes even disinfect the saltshakers. At Aldercrest Health & Rehabilitation Center in Edmonds, Washington, the front door was locked. A nurse in gloves greeted visitors in mid-March with a thermometer. Anyone above 100.3 degree Fahrenheit was turned away.  At some nursing homes, relatives have begun to communicate with quarantined residents through windows panes, as if visiting prisoners at the local lockup.  Dorothy Campbell, 88, stood in front of a closed window at the Life Care Center one day earlier this month. On the other side, beyond her reflection, her 89-year-old husband, Gene, spoke with her on a phone. They couldn't touch.  Dorothy Campbell, 88, visits her 89-year-old husband Gene through a window.

She stood outside the facility on March 1 with a sign.  "No one at Life Care is answering the phones," it reads. "He needs to be attended to ... what is his temperature?"

"Make no mistake about it, we're making steady progress."

The policy mirrors CDC guidelines.  Still, there were no tests on hand even if a patient was approved for testing, the doctor told CNN last week, calling on state and federal health officials "to loosen the criteria on testing."  Among those waiting for tests were nearly 20 Washington state firefighters and paramedics who believe they were exposed to people who tested positive. The reason: They have shown no signs of illness.  Officially declaring the national emergency on Friday, Trump said $50 billion in federal funds would become available for states to combat the virus. Private labs and vaccine developers will provide millions of coronavirus tests within a month, including half a million by this week, according to the President.  But don't rush to get tested.  "We don't want everybody taking this test," Trump said. "It's totally unnecessary."  He also denied missteps some health experts say aggravated the crisis.  "I don't take responsibility at all," he said, insisting problems that led to slow test-kit distribution were the fault of previous administrations.

2020-03-16	Hong Kong (CNN) For the first time since the novel coronavirus was first identified last year, there are now more reported cases outside of mainland China than inside, marking a new milestone in the evolution of the global pandemic.  On Monday, China's National Health Commission reported 16 new confirmed cases and 14 deaths, as of end of Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 80,860, of which more than 67,000 patients have recovered.  While China, the early epicenter of the outbreak, has still had more total confirmed cases than any other nation, infection rates in several other countries have surged in recent days. Italy, Europe's hardest hit country, now has more than 24,000 cases, Iran has almost 14,000, Spain has at least 7,000 and the United States has now reported more than 3,400 cases.  The combined global caseload stands at 169,446 as of Monday morning, with the death toll passing 6,500, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and additional sources.  The continued acceleration of cases comes as countries around the world rush to implement emergency measures in an effort to contain the virus and enforce social distancing, including nationwide lockdowns, imposing border and travel restrictions, school closures and ordering restaurants, cafes and bars to close or reduce services.  On Friday, the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Europe had become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. "More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic," he said.  Italy on Sunday announced 368 new fatalities in just 24 hours, bringing the total death toll in the country to 1,809, according to the country's Civil Protection Department.  Fears of a second wave  As cases blow up in Europe and North America, fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases.  Countries such as China, South Korea, Japan and Singapore have seen caseloads stabilize in recent weeks, thanks largely to a combination of aggressive containment and social distancing measures.  Tens of millions of people in mainland China and elsewhere in Asia were subjected to varying restrictions, with people unable to leave their homes or housing compounds, or go to work or school.  But a rise in infections linked to overseas travel has led to concerns that those sacrifices could be undone.  Governments across the region are now stepping up quarantine and travel restrictions. From Monday, all overseas travelers arriving in the Chinese capital Beijing will be sent to quarantine facilities for 14 days at their own cost, according to state media . Authorities in Beijing had previously required all passengers arriving in the capital from overseas to self-quarantine, either at home or in a designated facility, for two complete weeks.  Health officials in Wuhan -- ground zero for the outbreak -- told citizens to avoid going out as much as possible as the city is still facing a "severe" epidemic, amid a continuation of locally transmitted cases.  In Singapore, authorities have announced the introduction of a 14-day mandatory self-quarantine for new visitors traveling from several East Asian countries, Switzerland and the UK. And Hong Kong has urged its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Ireland, the UK and US.  US Fed cuts rate, new guidelines to be released  US Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday said new guidelines will be released Monday regarding potential curfews or closures of locations such as restaurants.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended canceling or postponing events involving more than 50 people for eight weeks and several states and cities have announced widespread mandatory closures as part of attempts to curb the spread of the virus.  Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington and Pennsylvania are temporarily closing restaurants and bars, with some exceptions, while schools are closed in 32 states. New York announced Sunday that it would be closing all theaters and concert halls and only allowing takeaway food from restaurants, as the number of cases in New York City rose to 329, with five deaths.  In an emergency action to support the economy during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced on Sunday it would cut its target interest rate to zero. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the measures were "essential to contain the outbreak," but will "take a toll on the economy in the near term."  It comes as US stocks plummeted into a bear market last week, with Wall Street having its worst day since October 19, 1987. On Sunday, US stock futures dropped 5%, hitting the "limit down" -- meaning they can't fall any further.  Global impact  Elsewhere, countries in almost every continent are ramping up emergency measures of their own as cases continue to climb.  Lebanon has closed its airport, borders and ports for two weeks starting Sunday until March 29, Information Minister Manal Abdul Samad said in a news conference on Sunday in Beirut. The government is banning public and private gatherings and government offices will be closed except for security, health and service offices, according to Abul Samad.  The Iraqi government announced it will place Baghdad under a curfew starting Tuesday through to March 23, according to the prime minister's office. Under the curfew, people are not allowed to leave their houses for nearly a week.  In Europe, the Czech Republic has shut down public services to prevent the spread of the virus, while Ireland has called on pubs to close and asked people not to participate in any parties.

As of Sunday, French health authorities said there are 5,423 confirmed cases in the country, with 127 deaths reported.  South Africa declared a national disaster and announced far-reaching travel restrictions to combat the virus, Kenya's government announced new travel restrictions after confirming two more cases, and Morocco has suspended all international flights to and from its territory "until further notice," according to its foreign ministry.  Peru, which has reported 71 cases of coronavirus, closed its borders and issued a nationwide state of emergency on Sunday, ordering people to stay home and self-quarantine. Colombia said it will block entry for all non-residents and require residents who enter the country to self-isolate for 14 days.
2020-03-16	(CNN) The suspension of all major sport in the US as measures were implemented in an effort to contain the novel coronavirus has hit some of those working in the industry hard.  With the NBA season indefinitely suspended, thousands of hourly employees at basketball arenas, for example, will miss out on pay.  In response, some of sport's top earners are donating a portion of their wages to help those in need.  NFL player JJ Watt and his wife Kealia Ohai, a professional soccer player for the Chicago Red Stars, have led the way, donating $350,000 to the Houston Food Bank.  According to ESPN, the money donated by the Houston Texan defensive lineman and Ohai will provide over one million meals to those in need.
2020-03-16	Washington (CNN) The US military has curtailed another major military exercise, Defender-Europe 20, which had been anticipated to be one of the largest US military drills in Europe since the end of the Cold War, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.  It is just the latest major exercise to be discontinued , curtailed or postponed due to growing concerns about the pandemic. The movement of US military personnel in Europe, Asia and the Middle East have also been placed under increased restrictions to help prevent the spread of the virus.  "In response to the current outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and recent guidance by the Secretary of Defense, we have modified exercise DEFENDER-Europe 20 in size and scope. As of March 13, all movement of personnel and equipment from the United States to Europe has ceased. The health, safety and readiness of our military, civilians, and family members is our primary concern," US European Command said in a statement.  The exercise had been touted as a sign of US solidarity with Europe and included the movement of some 20,000 troops to the continent.  Several other drills that were linked to the larger exercise, including Dynamic Front, Joint Warfighting Assessment, Saber Strike and Swift Response, "will not be conducted," according to the statement.

"This is a crazy time, but remember we're all in it together," Timberlake wrote. "Start small and support your local communities by getting food out to those in need."  Vanessa Hudgens  The actress threw her support behind the organization Feeding America in a post on her Instagram account.  "It's a crazy time out there in the world," the former Disney star wrote. "School closures, job disruptions, lack of paid sick leave and the coronavirus' disproportionate impact on adults age 60 and older and low-income families are all contributing to the demands placed on food banks across the country."  Donatella Versace  The fashion mogul and her daughter Allegra are giving back to her native Italy which has been hard hit.  "In times like this, it is important to be united and support however we can to help all those who are in the front lines, fighting every day to save hundreds of lives," a statement on her Instagram account reads. ""This is why Allegra and I have decided to make a personal donation of 200,000 euros to the intensive care department of San Raffaele hospital in Milan."  "Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this disease and to all the doctors and medical staff who have been working heroically non-stop in the past weeks in the effort to take care of our loved ones," she added.

Their donations will reportedly be used to distribute face masks and hand sanitizers to those in need in South Korea.
2020-03-16	A version of this story appeared in the March 16 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.  (CNN) "We must respond with a wartime mentality." This was Mayor Bill de Blasio's message overnight to New Yorkers as he ordered bars and restaurants to close their doors in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Similar shutdowns are being imposed in other cities and states, from California to Massachusetts , and millions of Americans are waking up today to ever more stringent restrictions.  Life in the US is increasingly looking like life in Europe, where a growing number of countries have sealed their borders and launched severe lockdowns as deaths rise and pressure mounts on governments to limit the spread of the disease.  There are now more reported cases of the virus outside mainland China than inside, for the first time since the outbreak began in December last year. As cases blow up in Europe and North America, fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases, with many countries moving to ban or quarantine foreign travelers.  In a bold, emergency move to support the economy, the US Federal Reserve announced yesterday it would cut its target interest rate to near zero and launch a $700 billion quantitative easing program. But as markets in Asia Pacific and Europe continued their declines today, it is clear investors aren't satisfied.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Life will change in US  On Sunday, America's leading infectious diseases expert summed up what's in store for Americans in the near future: "For a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States." Dr. Anthony Fauci also warned that hundreds of thousands of Americans could die unless every citizen joins an effort to blunt the pandemic -- only to be contradicted by President Donald Trump, Stephen Collinson writes . Trump is still insisting the virus is under "tremendous" control and has urged everyone to "take it easy" and "relax."  During the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate in Washington yesterday -- held with podiums 6 feet apart, per CDC guidelines, and opening with elbow bumps instead of handshakes -- Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders said they'd deploy the US military to fight the coronavirus if they were POTUS.  Stocks tumble as China reveals shocking economic data  Global stock markets plunged today as investors were unnerved by drastic action from the US Federal Reserve to cushion the blow from coronavirus and as data showed the outbreak has caused an unprecedented economic collapse in China. Markets were battered in Asia, with Australia's benchmark index crashing nearly 10% in its worst day on record. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 fell 7% in early trading, while US markets were poised to suffer heavy losses: Dow futures were last down 1,041 points, or about 4.5%.  China's economy was devastated by the novel coronavirus outbreak in the first two months of the year, according to data published today, and analysts say the nightmare is far from over, Laura He writes . The collapse in activity affected every sector of the world's second biggest economy, as the draconian measures designed to contain the outbreak there delivered an unprecedented shock that is now being replicated around the world. Retail sales plunged 20.5% during January and February over the same period in 2019, industrial output was down 13.5%, and fixed asset investment fell by nearly 25%. All three data points were much weaker than analysts were expecting, and the decline in industrial production was the sharpest contraction on record. The data for March could be even worse.  Europe is epicenter of the pandemic  Tens of millions of people are coming to grips with severe restrictions on their daily lives across Europe, now the global epicenter of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Germany is sealing its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg. The Netherlands has ordered all schools, bars, restaurants and cafes closed; long queues formed outside Amsterdam's famous cannabis "coffee shops" before the ban came into effect. Similar measures are also in force in France and the Czech Republic. Austria is prohibiting all gatherings -- public and private -- of more than five people. In Spain, a national lockdown has gone into effect and the Prime Minister's wife has tested positive. In Ireland, all pubs are closed. Britain's health secretary has confirmed people over 70 will be asked to stay at home, as the UK comes under increasing pressure to adopt stricter measures.  EU finance ministers will hold a video conference today to discuss a coordinated economic response to the pandemic. In a video message yesterday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on EU members to pull their medical resources and work together to make life-saving equipment.  Asia fights off second wave  Residents in Asia were among the first to endure lockdowns and travel restrictions -- but now a rise in infections linked to overseas travel has led to concerns that those sacrifices could be undone, Helen Regan writes . Governments across the region are now stepping up quarantine and travel restrictions. From today, all overseas travelers arriving in Beijing will be sent to quarantine facilities for 14 days at their own cost, according to Chinese state media. From March 19, Hong Kong will expand its 14-day mandatory self-quarantine to include the UK, alongside 30 other countries and regions. South Korea, which is seeing a slowdown of new infections, has expanded special immigration measures to cover all of Europe -- the measures include an app to monitor your temperature daily.  ON OUR RADAR  TODAY'S TOP TIP  To survive lockdown as a parent, commit yourself to some sense of order -- but at the same time, yield to the chaos, Elissa Strauss writes . Do what you need to lower your stress levels, whether it is carving out alone time or exercise time. Maybe you ease up on your television and video game policy or accept the power of candy as a bribe to help your kids comply. Create some structure that you can realistically commit to (and on most days achieve), and importantly, make sure you are enjoying some parts of it.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.  Q: How seriously should I be taking social distancing?  A: Social distancing, a preventative measure encouraged by health and government officials to stop the spread of coronavirus, is altering the way people eat, work and socialize -- and for good reason.

2020-03-16	Kent Sepkowitz, MD, is an infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen, much attention in the US has been given to improving the availability of the diagnostic test.  Though testing is known to effectively reduce the risk of transmission, many experts are beginning to also associate more widespread testing with the statistic of greatest concern -- survival from the disease.  The connection seems straightforward. Consider two countries with large outbreaks.  In South Korea, the rate of testing has been quite high (3,692 tests per million people as of March 8), and its mortality among those infected quite low (about 0.6%, or 66 deaths, at last count).  By contrast, Italy tests about 826 people per million and its mortality among those with diagnosed infection is about 10 times higher, with more than 1,000 people dead from the disease.  Furthermore, stories abound of sick people in the US showing up at doctors' offices and hospital ERs, asking to be tested yet being sent away because no test is available or because they don't fit the testing criteria -- leading many to comment that the lack of testing is going to kill us all.  But we should be clear that more testing saves lives by preventing the next infection, not by allowing doctors to catch an individual patient earlier. The "treat early" paradigm works when there is an effective drug against the disease. Give antibiotics early for sepsis, you live; wait too long, you die.  The coronavirus, though, has no specific treatment. Indeed, the syndrome of a rapidly progressing lung failure that appears to kill COVID-infected persons is a familiar clinical condition. Many infections and exposures can cause the same problem; ICU specialists have been treating it for years.  So why does Korea, the poster child of testing, have so few deaths while Italy and its late-to-the-table testing program have so many? Is it only because more testing brings mild cases into the "infected" group, diluting the statistical impact of the handful of the very ill?  Doubtful. For now, it is because of vast differences in the affected patients. Soon and increasingly, it also will be due to overwhelmed hospitals and doctors and nurses.  Which is probably bad news for those hoping that the United States, which is currently way, way behind in testing for coronavirus, can somehow test itself out of the mess.  Plenty has already been written about how the population of Italy differs from much of the world. According to a UN report in 2015, 28.6% of the Italian population was 60 years old or older (second in the world after Japan at 33%). This compares to South Korea, where 18.5% of the population is at least 60 years of age, ranking 53rd globally.  The impact of this disparity is quickly shown in the analysis of coronavirus deaths in each county. In Italy, 90% of the more than 1,000 deaths occur in those 70 or older.  By contrast, the outbreak in South Korea has occurred among much younger people . There, only 20% of cases have been diagnosed in those 60 years old and up. The largest affected group is those in their 20s, who account for almost 30% of all cases.  Then there is gender. The gender split in COVID-19 cases worldwide is about 50-50, but there are gender differences in survival. According to data from the original outbreak in China, the overall death rate is 4.7% in men versus 2.8% in women -- a whopping difference. Which is good news for South Korea, where 62% of cases occur among women.  Smoking is another factor clearly associated with poor survival. Smoking rates are about the same between the two countries: 24% for Italians and 27% for South Koreans. But gender differences among smokers are widely different: In Italy, 28% of men versus 20% of women smoke, while in Korea, it is about 50% of men and less than 5% (!) of women.  In other words, South Korea has an outbreak among youngish, non-smoking women, whereas Italy's disease is occurring among the old and the very old, many of whom are smokers. (We do not know the male-female breakdown of Italy's cases).  These basic demographic distinctions explain the difference in death rates between these two hard-hit countries -- as well as helping to explain why Seattle, with its nursing home outbreak, accounts for such a large proportion of US coronavirus deaths.  To understand exactly what is happening, we need daily case updates to include information about age and sex.  The blundering lack of an effective testing program in the US is an unconscionable failure and has led (and will lead) to more transmission of COVID-19.  But it is important to recognize that survival with the infection is a completely other matter, one that will require very different investments, training, and expertise.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The optimal program will have special beds to prevent bed sores, pharmacists with understanding of how medications are cleared differently in the elderly, and nurses familiar with frailty. Simply testing more and testing harder will not save the lives of the thousands of already infected Americans.  Better preparation might. And given the glaring differences in the outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, it is time to assemble an expert panel of geriatricians, social scientists, ICU specialists and others to sort out how best to protect and, when necessary, treat coronavirus in the elderly.
2020-03-16	Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Africa has so far recorded relatively few coronavirus cases compared to the rest of the world, but governments across the continent are taking no chances as they race to stop the spread of the virus on their shores.  Sudan has sealed off all sea ports, land crossings and airports, a spokesman for Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council, Mohamed Al-Faki Suleiman, said in a press statement Monday.  The Council has declared a state of medical emergency and formed a committee that will prevent the spread of coronavirus into the country.  The committee will receive citizens stranded in land crossings and prepare places for them to go into quarantine in the country, which has so far recorded one case of COVID-19, according to t he African Center for Disease Control.  Twenty-seven African countries have recorded only 347 coronavirus cases , according to the World Health Organization on Monday.  Four countries -- Egypt, Algeria, South Africa and Morocco -- account for more than half of the novel coronavirus cases on the continent.  Seven people have died from Covid-19 in Africa -- four in Algeria, two in Egypt and one in Morocco.  Travel restrictions  Many African countries are shutting their airports and land borders to keep out people from countries that have a high number of coronavirus cases.  Hundreds of international flights have been canceled, schools have closed and travelers from coronavirus-hit countries have been restricted or, in some cases, banned from visiting some countries in Africa.  Egypt, with the highest number of coronavirus cases in Africa, announced it was suspending flights from all its airports starting Thursday to stop the spread of the virus, Ahram Online reported.  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Egypt is 126, according to the World Health Organization . Schools and universities have been closed in the country for at least two weeks, state media reported.  Some countries such as Djibouti are yet to record a single case, but it has suspended all international flights to the country, the US Embassy in Djibouti said in a statement announcing the suspension  There is widespread support on the continent for governments to impose travel bans. One Twitter user noted that Western countries would have acted swiftly to place travel sanctions on travelers if the outbreak originated in Africa.  "I hope African countries close up their borders to all these majorly affected countries because we all know the west would ban travel had Coronavirus started in Africa," they said.  Advice against restrictions  The travel bans and restrictions goes against the advice of the WHO, which has urged countries to not apply blind travel restrictions in a way that would impact trade and travel.  WHO Africa's Dr. Mary Stephen told CNN that many African countries, which were initially screening passengers from countries with outbreaks and also placing travelers from virus-hit countries on quarantine, may now be making travel ban decisions based on panic.  "The outbreak is evolving. It used to be China and now it is Italy and other countries are following after it. So we must be careful because we have seen an increasing number of countries imposing travel restrictions, and that means their perception of risks have changed. But have they done a risk assessment to their countries or are they just implementing those measures based on their perception?" she said.  Stephen, who is with the organization's emergencies team, said African countries need to enhance their capacities to detect early, isolate and track all patients' contacts and effectively manage the sick to curb the spread of coronavirus.  She added that airport screening and a robust surveillance system were effective ways to detect cases from travelers without symptoms.  "WHO continues to advise countries not to impose travel restrictions but countries also have their sovereignty," she said.  'A ban on foreign nationals'  With 61 confirmed cases as of Monday, South Africa has the second-highest coronavirus numbers on the continent and has declared a "national state of disaster." It has also put in place a number of travel restrictions on foreign nationals in a bid to halt the spread of the virus.  "We are imposing a travel ban on foreign nationals from high-risk countries such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and China as from 18 March 2020," President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his address to the nation on Sunday.  Ramaphosa said the country was seeing an internal transmission of the virus that was first detected in a group that traveled to Italy. He said the government will take "urgent and drastic measures'' to protect the citizens and its economy.  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Sunday.  Visas issued to nationals from affected countries before the travel ban have also been revoked, the president said.  Ramaphosa said foreigners who have visited these countries in the last 20 days would also be denied a visa to travel to the country.  He announced the closure of half of the county's land ports and schools and banned public gatherings of more than 100 people across the nation.  Impact on tourism  In Kenya, the government raised the stakes by imposing a travel ban on foreigners from all countries that have reported any case of coronavirus.  The directive will come into effect on Tuesday and remain for a month, the government said in a statement on Sunday.  After announcing its first case last week, Kenya's Secretary for Tourism Najib Balala, said the country's economy would be "hit badly," and that the tourism sector would be the most affected.  Balala said the government has allocated 500 million Kenyan shillings ($4.8 million) for public relations and marketing post-coronavirus.  Morocco has suspended all international flights to and from its territory "until further notice" as part of measures to tackle the coronavirus, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday. It had previously banned flights to and from Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium.  Schools shut down, social distancing  Ghana, with six confirmed cases, announced similar travel restrictions on Sunday and warned airlines not to board foreigners from countries that have recorded more than 200 cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks.  "All travel to Ghana is strongly discouraged at this point in time," Ghana's Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah said in a video posted on Facebook on Sunday.  Measures to check the spread of the virus in the West African nation covered more than travel bans.  President Nana Akudo-Addo, in a separate address to the nation on Sunday, said the government was shutting all universities and schools in the West African nation.  All public gatherings, including conferences and church services, have been suspended for four weeks. Akudo-Addo called on citizens to practice social distancing and good hygiene to prevent the virus spread in the country.  "We are determined to do whatever we can to prevent the spread of the virus, and protect the population. All the measures that have been announced will be subject to constant review and enhancement, if necessary," the president said.  Ethiopia, Senegal and Kenya have announced school closures and bans on public assemblies to check the spread of the virus which has killed 6,500 people globally and sickened more than 169,000 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and additional sources.  Uganda imposed travel restrictions last week on 16 countries it said had high cases of coronavirus, including the US and the UK, becoming the first in the pack to enforce such stringent travel advisory for foreign nationals.  Health authorities in the East African nation warned foreign nationals and Ugandan citizens in the affected countries to stay away or pay for their self-quarantine.  Clamor for border closure  People in Cameroon are calling on the government to close airports and borders into the West African nation after the country confirmed its fifth case of coronavirus on Monday. A French citizen was the first to test positive for the virus in the country.  Health Minister Dr. Manaouda Malachie, who announced the case on Twitter, did not name the nationality of the infected patient but that has not stopped citizens demanding that a travel ban be imposed on foreigners coming into the country.  "Listen to the plea of the people of Cameroon and close the border and quarantine everyone coming into the country. Countries that heavily depend on tourism have done so," Chapafac Christwadle tweeted.
2020-03-17	Washington, DC (CNN Business) The United States' internet and wireless networks are coming under immense pressure to deliver reliable connectivity as schools and businesses confronting the novel coronavirus have shifted their day-to-day operations out of the workplace and into homes, according to industry analysts and government officials.  "This is going to be an enormous stress test for our communications networks," said Blair Levin, a former Federal Communications Commission chief of staff and author of the agency's 2010 plan to improve internet access nationwide.  Schools and universities nationwide have implemented remote learning plans in response to the outbreak. Countless major businesses, includingand, have asked their employees to work from home . As cities shut down bars and restaurants , routine social interactions are increasingly moving online: People are using FaceTime to connect with family and friends, Zoom for business meetings, YouTube for livestreamed events. Online games, food delivery apps andare becoming bigger alternatives to a dinner out.  This shift in Americans' internet consumption patterns may soon reveal weak points in the complex ecosystem of companies, services and products that make up the internet, said Jessica Rosenworcel, a commissioner at the FCC.  From aging home WiFi routers and digital collaboration tools to exchange points in the internet backbone, there can be many potential areas of failure, Rosenworcel told CNN.  "There are a lot of different elements of bringing internet into the home, and a lot of places where we could find stress in the system," she said.  One of those places could be the increasing use of virtual private networks, which allow employees across the public and private sectors to connect to their organization's internal data and tools when working remotely. Unfortunately, said Rosenworcel, many VPNs are not built to handle entire companies or organizations logging on at the same time.  Amazon AMZN Cisco CSCO Another area where demand may surge could be providers of cloud computing — such asWeb Services, which powers everything from video streaming sites to the social networks where Americans could soon spend more of their time. Content delivery networks operated by Cloudflare and Akamai, which help carry internet content from distant servers to your device, could face greater loads — as well as collaboration tools produced by Google and, which are increasingly being used for teleworking. (Amazon and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.)  "When you've got a couple of parents at home working remotely, you've got a handful of kids home going to school remotely, the demands on the bandwidth become challenged," said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the FCC.  Cisco told CNN on Tuesday that it has seen "unprecedented" volumes of traffic on its Webex digital conferencing platform, a service many office workers may have seldom used but will now become intimately familiar.  Since the outbreak began, Webex usage originating in China has increased 22-fold, Cisco said. In the last 10 days, the company said, usage of the platform globally has doubled, with 3.2 million meetings conducted on Webex in the last 24 hours alone. More than 300 million people use the Webex platform on a monthly basis.  "We are building as fast as we can," Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC on Tuesday. "We are trying to boost our collaboration team's and our security team's spirits, because they are working around the clock."  On high alert  Internet traffic in Seattle — one of the first US cities to be hit hard by the virus — is spiking as employees at major tech companies in the area work from home, said Cloudflare, which monitors large swaths of the web. Normally, the company said in a blog post, traffic increases during the day and ebbs at night. But in Seattle now, "traffic is up about 40% and nighttime troughs are now above the levels seen in January during the day," indicating a surge of demand on broadband networks.  Some of that may be attributable to increased use of digital entertainment. With many people around the world cooped up inside, traffic to video streaming and online gaming has grown, Cloudflare said in a blog post. In South Korea, it said, online gaming activity jumped 30% between March 5 and March 12, while streaming of content from anime sites has doubled.  Internet providers such as AT&T and Verizon are on high alert for dramatic changes in home internet consumption. (CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia, is owned by AT&T.)  So far, said Levin, there doesn't appear to be a major spike — yet — because the US has only just begun to implement telework policies. But judging from the experience of European countries, which are days ahead of the US in terms of the virus's impact on society, broadband companies should be able to handle the load because they are built to accommodate sudden jumps in demand.  "Italy had a roughly 70% increase, France demonstrated, like, a 30% increase," said Levin. "I think the networks can handle that."  Verizon VZ In a statement on its website,said it has not yet witnessed a major increase in data traffic since the outbreak, but it is adding capacity and expecting a shift in home internet usage from evenings to the daytime.  AT&T T said in a statement that its network is controlled by software that allows it to dynamically adjust to changes in demand.  "This allows us to respond rapidly to surges, enable capacity enhancements quickly, and rapidly address any security concerns," the company said.  As private sector prepares, calls for government to do more  Comcast CCZ Many internet providers, such as, have announced special changes in response to the coronavirus, including waiving data caps and late fees, while pledging not to disconnect service from customers who have trouble paying their bills. Last week, dozens of providers, including Charter Communications and CenturyLink, said they would agree to a call by the FCC's chairman, Ajit Pai, not to disconnect customers, waive late fees and open up their proprietary WiFi hotspots to the public.  Paul de Sa, an industry analyst and a former senior FCC official, said those commitments indicate the companies are probably prepared.  "Worst case, you might get some detrimental effects on quality of service at peak times," he told CNN. "But basic work-from-home activities — like sending larger document attachments, more emails and chats — don't add much time-sensitive traffic."  But Rosenworcel said rather than relying on the voluntary generosity of internet providers, many of which only serve specific geographic markets, the US government should have a national policy on what broadband companies should offer the public in a time of crisis. And the FCC, she said, should explore how it can use its emergency authorities more effectively to support them. A spokesperson for the agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Although the shift to telework may be relatively seamless for urban, wealthier Americans who can afford fast home internet, the trend is likely to hit lower-income and rural Americans harder. People in those areas often lack good broadband access and, even if it is available, they don't always sign up for service.  "If large numbers of residents [in a small] town try to connect simultaneously, they may find that the town itself is virtually cut off by the lack of fiber capacity linking the town to larger Internet hubs," said Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at the firm MoffettNathanson.  Meanwhile, the government lacks accurate maps of who has broadband, so determining which areas are likely to suffer the most will be more challenging, said Levin.  "We're in much better shape than we were 10 years ago," said Levin, referring to the deployment of high-speed access. But because of the mapping issue, "it could be that two-thirds of the population is still getting lower speeds" and officials wouldn't necessarily know.
2020-03-17	(CNN) Dozens of people from their 50s to their 90s have died in the United States after contracting the novel coronavirus and the death toll continues rising.  At least 112 people have died since the first US case of the coronavirus was reported in January and the virus has spread to all states, the District of Columbia and some territories.  While the majority were treated at hospitals, a woman in Washington died at home.  A couple in Indiana infected with the virus could not be together when one of them died. As they were hospitalized, they used iPads to see each other and a nurse stayed with one of them before dying, according to Dr. Ram Yeleti, chief physician executive with Community Health Network.  It's unclear whether any deaths include foreign-born individuals, and authorities have not disclosed all of their ages.  Here's what we have learned about those who have died because of the coronavirus, according to a CNN tally of data from state heath officials.  Most of them were 60 years and older  Health officials have said that older adults were twice as likely to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus and the fatal cases in the US appear to reflect that.  The majority of people who have died were in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. The youngest were in their early or mid-50s.  Many lived in nursing homes or other facilities  The deadliest cluster so far has been linked to a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington. More than 20 people who lived there and someone who visited the facility have died.  People who lived in other long-term care facilities in Washington, Florida and Kansas contracted the virus and died.  Many had other health problems  Diabetes, emphysema and heart problems were among the pre-existing conditions that some people suffered before they were diagnosed with coronavirus.  Only a few traveled abroad  Authorities are still trying to determine how many contracted the virus but have said some of those who died recently traveled overseas.  In California, one person went to Thailand and another one was on a cruise to Mexico. Two people in Florida had traveled outside the country.

2020-03-17	Bolivia’s borders will be closed due to the ongoing threat of coronavirus, Interim President Jeanine Áñez announced in a statement released by her office on Tuesday.  Effective Thursday, only Bolivian citizens and residents may enter the country, the statement said. Travelers entering the country must follow protocols implemented by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.  International and national flights will be suspended starting Friday, the statement said. The transportation of goods will still be allowed into Bolivia.  In addition to border closures, work days will be shortened and markets will open for limited hours. The measures will be in place until March 31.
2020-03-17	Hong Kong (CNN) Tens of millions of people in Southeast Asia have had their movements, travel and daily life restricted as countries prepare for a surge in novel coronavirus cases .  On Monday, Malaysia's Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced some of the most far-reaching measures yet imposed in the region, with strict nationwide controls locking down all travel in or out of the country in an effort to stem infections of Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus  Malaysians will be banned from traveling abroad, while foreign tourists and visitors will be restricted from entering the country, according to the state-run Bernama News Agency. All Malaysians who have just returned from overseas will be required to undergo a health check and self-quarantine for 14 days.  The sweeping travel ban comes as Malaysia reported 125 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 553, according to a tweet from Malaysia's Health Ministry. On Sunday, the country reported 190 new cases. Most of the new infections from both days are linked to a religious rally that thousands attended near the capital Kuala Lumpur, the Health Ministry said.  The control order, which will start Wednesday and last until the end of the month, includes a "comprehensive restriction on movements and public gatherings," including a ban on all religious, sports, social, and cultural activities, Bernama reported. Malaysia is home to more than 31 million people.  All houses of worship and business premises will be closed, with the exception of supermarkets, wet markets, grocery shops and convenience stores selling daily necessities. Most government premises, except those providing essential services such as water and electricity, will also be closed, Bernama reported.  Schools, universities and other education institutions will be closed until the end of the month.  "I appeal to everyone to always comply with this movement control order. It is our common responsibility that we must implement as citizens who are concerned about our family, our society and our country," Muhyiddin said.  Meanwhile, Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Minister Chan Chun Sing sought to allay fears that it will run out of food stocks and other supplies.  "While we may have to make some adjustments to our choices, we do have sufficient supplies for all Singaporeans, so long as we buy responsibly," Chan said in a televised press conference.  Singapore imports 90% of the food it consumes and there has been a rush on panic buying in recent weeks, with concerns that the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent region-wide lockdowns will disrupt the city state's food supplies.  Chan said Singapore has a contingency plan in place for such a scenario and that food stocks will be sufficient until alternative supplies are found.  Philippines on lockdown  Meanwhile, the Philippines placed half the country -- about 50 million people -- under an "enhanced community quarantine" in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.  Luzon, the Philippines' largest and most populous island that includes the capital Manila, has effectively been locked down. All mass public transportation has been suspended, and residents told they can only leave their homes for essential items, according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines.  Offices have been shut and only supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, medical clinics, pharmacies, and banks, as well as food delivery services and water stations will be allowed to remain open.  From Tuesday midnight local time, people have 72 hours to leave the island if they wish, after which all air travel to Luzon will be restricted.  Filipino nationals, their spouses and children, permanent residents and holders of diplomatic visas will still be allowed entry, as will cargo, according to CNN Philippines.  Enforcing the new measures will be a 70,000-strong police force on Luzon and anyone violating the quarantine may face arrest, CNN Philippines reported.  Video showed queues of commuters lined up at border checkpoints with authorities checking temperatures on Monday morning after Manila was placed in a community quarantine.  The Philippines has reported 140 cases of coronavirus and 12 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.  Elsewhere, countries are preparing to stave off widespread infections. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said that the country's cabinet will meet on Tuesday to decide on enacting measures restricting public gatherings, closing schools, sport arenas and Muay Thai boxing rings.  Those measures include canceling the annual Songkran New Year water festival, which attracts millions of visitors each year who take part in mass water fights, and a large number of Thais travel back to their hometowns.  Reported coronavirus cases in the country have jumped in recent days after months of incremental increases. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health reported 33 new cases on Monday -- the biggest single-day increase -- bringing the total to 147. Most of the new infected are among people who attended Muay Thai boxing events.  Fears of a second surge  The novel coronavirus has infected more than 181,500 people and killed over 7,100 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources.  The continued acceleration of cases comes as countries around the world rush to implement emergency measures in an effort to contain the virus and enforce social distancing, including nationwide lockdowns, imposing border and travel restrictions, school closures and ordering restaurants, cafes and bars to close or reduce services.  Fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases.  Countries such as China, South Korea, and Singapore have seen caseloads stabilize in recent weeks, thanks largely to a combination of aggressive containment and social distancing measures.  Tens of millions of people in mainland China and elsewhere in Asia were subjected to varying restrictions, with people unable to leave their homes or housing compounds, or go to work or school.  But a rise in infections linked to overseas travel has led to concerns that those sacrifices could be undone.  Governments across the region are now stepping up quarantine and travel restrictions. From Monday, all overseas travelers arriving in the Chinese capital Beijing will be sent to quarantine facilities for 14 days at their own cost, according to state media. Authorities in Beijing had previously required all passengers arriving in the capital from overseas to self-quarantine, either at home or in a designated facility, for two complete weeks.  In Singapore, authorities have announced the introduction of a 14-day mandatory self-quarantine for new visitors traveling from several East Asian countries, Switzerland and the UK. And Hong Kong has urged its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Ireland, the UK and US.
2020-03-18	Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria is restricting entry into the country for travelers from 13 countries including the US and UK, as it announced five new cases Wednesday.  The restriction will apply to travelers from countries with more than 1,000 cases. They include China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, the United States, Norway, UK, Netherlands and Switzerland, the country's National Centre for Disease Control said on its Twitter account.  "The Federal Government of Nigeria has also suspended the issuance of visa on arrival to travelers from these countries. All travelers returning from these countries prior to the restriction will be in supervised self-isolation, monitored by the NCDC and Port Health Services," - the tweet read.  The restriction will take effect starting on March 20 and will be in place until further notice.  Health officials also announced an additional five cases of the virus in the country , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to eight. One of them is a recovered patient who came in contact with the index case to Nigeria, an Italian man on a business trip to the country, authorities said.  In an earlier statement on Tuesday, the NCDC said a 30-year-old woman, who came into the country after a short visit to the UK tested positive to coronavirus after she developed symptoms including coughing and a fever on her return.  She had self-isolated in her home when she arrived in the country on March 13 and called the agency when she developed symptoms, the NCDC said, adding that it had begun tracing those who had come in contact with her.  "We expect the number to be small because of her sensible decision to go into self-isolation from the time of her arrival," the statement read.  Africa shutting its doors  Nigeria joins other African countries that are shutting their airports and land borders to keep out people from countries that have a high number of coronavirus cases.  Tunisia on Monday suspended all international flights and closed the country's land borders in an attempt to contain the outbreak. It also banned gathering in markets and other places and introduced a nighttime curfew from 6 p.m to 6 a.m from Wednesday.  Sudan also sealed off all sea ports, land crossings and airports, a spokesman for Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council, Mohamed Al-Faki Suleiman, said in a press statement.  Hundreds of international flights have been canceled, schools have closed and travelers from coronavirus-hit countries have been restricted or, in some cases, banned from visiting some countries in Africa.  Egypt, with the highest number of coronavirus cases in Africa, announced it was suspending flights from all its airports starting Thursday to stop the spread of the virus, Ahram Online reported.  Some countries such as Djibouti are yet to record a single case, but it has suspended all international flights to the country, the US Embassy in Djibouti said in a statement  There is widespread support on the continent for governments to impose travel bans. One Twitter user noted that Western countries would have acted swiftly to place travel sanctions on travelers if the outbreak originated in Africa.  "I hope African countries close up their borders to all these majorly affected countries because we all know the west would ban travel had Coronavirus started in Africa," they said.  Advice against restrictions  The travel bans and restrictions goes against the advice of the WHO, which has urged countries to not apply blind travel restrictions in a way that would impact trade and travel.  WHO Africa's Dr. Mary Stephen told CNN that many African countries, which were initially screening passengers from countries with outbreaks and also placing travelers from virus-hit countries on quarantine, may now be making travel ban decisions based on panic.  "The outbreak is evolving. It used to be China and now it is Italy and other countries are following after it. So we must be careful because we have seen an increasing number of countries imposing travel restrictions, and that means their perception of risks have changed. But have they done a risk assessment to their countries or are they just implementing those measures based on their perception?" she said.  Stephen, who is with the organization's emergencies team, said African countries need to enhance their capacities to detect early, isolate and track all patients' contacts and effectively manage the sick to curb the spread of coronavirus.  She added that airport screening and a robust surveillance system were effective ways to detect cases from travelers without symptoms.  "WHO continues to advise countries not to impose travel restrictions but countries also have their sovereignty," she said.  'A ban on foreign nationals'  South Africa has declared a "national state of disaster," and put in place a number of travel restrictions on foreign nationals in a bid to halt the spread of the virus.  "We are imposing a travel ban on foreign nationals from high-risk countries such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and China as from 18 March 2020," President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his address to the nation on Sunday.  Ramaphosa said the country was seeing an internal transmission of the virus that was first detected in a group that traveled to Italy. He said the government will take "urgent and drastic measures'' to protect the citizens and its economy.  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Sunday.  Visas issued to nationals from affected countries before the travel ban have also been revoked, the president said.  Ramaphosa said foreigners who have visited these countries in the last 20 days would also be denied a visa to travel to the country.  He announced the closure of half of the county's land ports and schools and banned public gatherings of more than 100 people across the nation.  In Kenya, the government raised the stakes by imposing a travel ban on foreigners from all countries that have reported any case of coronavirus.  The directive came into effect on Tuesday and will remain for a month, the government said in a statement on Sunday.  Morocco has suspended all international flights to and from its territory "until further notice" as part of measures to tackle the coronavirus, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday. It had previously banned flights to and from Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium.  Schools shut down, social distancing  Ghana announced similar travel restrictions on Sunday and warned airlines not to board foreigners from countries that have recorded more than 200 cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks.  "All travel to Ghana is strongly discouraged at this point in time," Ghana's Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah said in a video posted on Facebook on Sunday.  Uganda imposed travel restrictions last week on 16 countries it said had high cases of coronavirus, including the US and the UK, becoming the first in the pack to enforce such stringent travel advisory for foreign nationals.  Health authorities in the East African nation warned foreign nationals and Ugandan citizens in the affected countries to stay away or pay for their self-quarantine.  Clamor for border closure  People in Cameroon are calling on the government to close airports and borders into the West African nation after the country confirmed its fifth case of coronavirus on Monday. A French citizen was the first to test positive for the virus in the country.  Health Minister Dr. Manaouda Malachie, who announced the case on Twitter, did not name the nationality of the infected patient but that has not stopped citizens demanding that a travel ban be imposed on foreigners coming into the country.  "Listen to the plea of the people of Cameroon and close the border and quarantine everyone coming into the country. Countries that heavily depend on tourism have done so," Chapafac Christwadle tweeted.
2020-03-18	Dwayne Briening, MD, is the Executive Director of Northwell Health Labs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.  Where are the tests? It's the question everyone is asking, as the nation scrambles to diagnose and contain Covid-19, also known as the novel coronavirus  There is growing anger over the slow pace of testing, and some are comparing the United States' sluggish response to the more successful response of countries like South Korea , but I want to assure you we are ramping up our capabilities and working around the clock.  The limited supply of test kits has been the biggest challenge. There are only a relative few public health facilities -- less than 100 at the moment , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- around the country that have been approved to perform the tests, including Northwell Health Labs, one of the nation's largest hospital labs, where I work, on Long Island in New York.  Currently, we are testing about 200 patient samples in our lab each day, using US Food and Drug Administration-approved manual and semi-automated testing systems. This has been a significant upgrade from the solely-manual testing that had been provided by the CDC, which allowed us to test about 60 individuals a day.  Semi-automated testing lets a technician inoculate a specimen taken from the nostril of a patient into a cartridge, which is then placed in a console for automatic incubation and analysis (the cartridge is something like a 1970's 8-track tape that snaps into the console like it's an 8-track player). This enables a "batch diagnosis" of several specimens every two and a half hours. When we begin operating at full capacity, over 2,000 patients a day will be tested, but we aren't quite there yet.  Northwell, for example, is working with GenMark Diagnostics, one of the first companies to get their semi-automated platform online and which received emergency use authorization from the FDA last week. But so are the other labs across the country, causing a major funnel block during a critical time.  We need to have patience.  JUST WATCHED Idris Elba posts video sharing positive coronavirus test Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Idris Elba posts video sharing positive coronavirus test 01:24  With the limited supplies, health care providers have needed to prioritize testing the sickest patients. Of course, there are exceptions, and we have also prioritized for infection-control needs and for monitoring exposure -- especially for patient populations within hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and also for managing health care workers' exposure to the virus.  As a country, we started late, but the full-court press is on to alleviate the effects of our delay. We're not doing enough testing because there are not enough tests out there yet.  So where are they?  Each test kit that comes off the manufacturing line has to be quality checked before it hits the marketplace. You can only rush that process so much before risking manufacturing accuracy and testing efficacy.  With Covid-19, quite frankly, we were slow out of the gate. Initially the CDC and FDA announced that they were going to create all the test kits. Because of this, none of the other labs were able to start down the pathway to develop test kits.  At that point, when it became clear that the virus was spreading faster than the CDC could deploy test kits, the FDA turned around and opened up the authorization criteria so that other laboratories, like ours, could develop their own.  Who gets tested? Testing only the sickest people has caused some panic among people who think they may have Covid-19. It's not feasible, at this point, for someone who has no symptoms but thinks they may have been in contact with an infected person to be tested. We need to focus on those who are presenting symptoms of the virus.  Aside from hospitals, physician offices and urgent care centers are where the majority of tests are being administered at the moment. Northwell is also working with New York State, mobilizing the health system's mobile phlebotomy team to perform nasal swabs in New Rochelle, which has been the epicenter of Covid-19 infection in New York. The initiative features drive-through swabbing center where patients can go to have samples collected and tested.  In response to the testing shortage, President Donald Trump announced last Friday that the FDA is creating a 24-hour emergency hotline for laboratories finding impediments to running tests, and officials are giving nearly $1.3 million of federal money to two companies trying to develop rapid-diagnosis Covid-19 tests.  I applaud these efforts and any efforts we can make as a nation and as a health care system to fast-track testing, epidemiologic surveillance and care. My fellow colleagues across the nation's health systems are doing everything and anything they can to speed accurate testing to the general public as soon as feasibly possible under our current circumstances.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Testing over the next couple of weeks is going to ramp up substantially, and you're going to see a tenfold increase in the ability to do testing throughout the country. And in another couple of weeks after that, you'll see a hundredfold increase.  Once we get there, then we will be meeting the demand. We'll get to the point soon where we will be testing for this virus just the same way we would test for any other flu virus.

2020-03-18	This story was originally published on March 18 and has been updated to reflect the latest numbers on confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center.  (CNN) While the coronavirus pandemic and climate change are inherently different issues, they share two important characteristics: both are global crises that threaten the lives of millions of people.  Yet only one crisis has inspired widespread, drastic action from countries across the globe.  As Covid-19 the disease caused by the virus, spreads, governments, businesses and individuals around the world have undertaken unprecedented measures akin to wartime efforts.  Countrieshave been put into lockdown, schools closed, events canceled, factories shuttered, millionstold to work from home and emergency funds released. No economic cost has been too big to stem the spread of the disease.  Coronavirus is proving that it is possible to make dramatic changes and economic sacrifices to save lives.  For decades, scientists have been demanding that climate crisis be taken this seriously. But despite numerous international agreements, governments have been slow to take action to reduce carbon emissions  "It actually hurts because it shows that at the national, or international level, if we need to take action we can. So why haven't we for climate? And not with words, with real actions," said Donna Green, associate professor at University of New South Wales's Climate Change Research Centre.  Heat-trapping emissions from human activity keep rising air pollution continues to choke cities, and the world is on track to warm by 3°C above pre-industrial levels.  So why haven't governments done more to protect their citizens from the impact of climate change?  Climate change is a global health crisis  The climate crisis is also a global health emergency.  Air pollution kills 7 million people every year, according to the World Health Organization. A recent study found toxic air shortens lives worldwide by nearly three years on average. And the life of every child born today will be profoundly affected by climate change, according to another report  The novel coronavirus, discovered in China in mid-December, has so far killed more than 24,000 people, and infected more than 550,000 in 176 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University , which is tracking cases reported by the WHO and additional sources.  The impact of the virus has been sudden and dramatic.  The toll of climate change is slow and steady -- but no less deadly.  Part of the difference in the response to the two crises is that, for many people, the virus is more of an immediate, tangible threat. The virus is infecting people now and is the undisputed source of their illness.  "You can put a virus particle down a microscope and draw a picture of it, it looks scary. You can explain how in medical science, you can deal with that particular virus, develop a vaccine and take steps to respond," said Green.  Climate crisis is not a virus. The illnesses it causes and dangers it poses come through a third party -- pollution, a flood, a drought -- giving climate crisis deniers an opportunity to argue they were caused by other factors.  And for many people not on the front lines, climate crisis feels like a future problem.  "In terms of their lives, and this being an existential crisis, and a threat, I don't think that comes off as immediately as something like a pandemic," said Miro Korenha, co-founder of Our Daily Planet, a Washington DC-based environmental news platform. "They hear climate change is something that might be off in the future, maybe it won't hit their community."  Acting quickly  South Korea, for example, has one of the worst outbreaks outside of China but it moved fast to conduct widespread testing , and in recent weeks its caseloads have stabilized.  There are concerns that other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, have been slow to act. A recent study by UK epidemiologists predicts that attempts to slow -- rather than actively halt, or suppress -- the novel coronavirus could overwhelm the number of intensive care hospital beds available and lead to about 250,000 deaths in the UK and more than one million in the US.  That lesson of preparedness applies to the climate crisis.  Countries need to act quickly to mitigate against future worst-case climate scenarios, rather than waiting for the disaster to peak before acting.  They can do this by reducing emissions, developing green technology and implementing effective climate policies.  We know what must be done -- both to stop the spread of coronavirus and to fight climate change -- but many countries that produce the most heat-trapping gases are waiting until it is too late.  Just as in some places, people have been slow to adopt the social distancing doctors are advising to fight the spread of the virus, not enough countries, especially those that produce the most heat-trapping gases, are taking significant action to slash emissions.  We have the tools  One of the unintended consequences of the drastic measures enforced by China during the coronavirus outbreak was a sharp drop in emissions.  China's air pollutant levels fell by about 20-30% in February as a result of the restrictions on industry and traffic, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.  Italy, which has the largest outbreak outside of China and has enacted widespread shutdowns, has also seen a big decline in air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions, according to the European Space Agency.  Travel bans have grounded flights and removed the ability to travel -- a big contributor to heat-trapping emissions. And working from home experiments are showing that not everyone needs to travel to the office.  suddenly closing all factories and banning cars from roads is not a sustainable way to tackle climate change. Governments have expressed concerns about the impact of closures and restrictions of movement on their economies, and on Tuesday, credit-rating agency Most agree, however, thatsuddenly closing all factories and banning cars from roadsis not a sustainable way to tackle climate change.Governments have expressed concerns about the impact of closures and restrictions of movement on their economies, and on Tuesday, credit-rating agency S&P Global said that the virus has plunged the world into a global recession  But climate scientists say that adapting to climate change does not require radical shutdowns -- the technology needed to reduce emissions already exists. Renewable energy sources are a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels, and making the switch makes economic sense.  "It's absolutely possible to completely transform our country and world economies in a way that's sustainable, in a way that would mitigate the risk," Green said.  Getting political  So if we have the tools, what's stopping action?  Scientists say politics plays a bit part in decision making.  His administration has scrubbed references to climate change, renewable energy and similar topics on websites across the federal government. There is also a powerful fossil fuel lobby in the US.  This ignorance or denial of the science is hampering the response to both the climate crisis and coronavirus.  In the US, Trump and officials in his administration have been at odds with what health experts are saying about the virus. Trump claimed the coronavirus death rate is lower than 3.4% based on a "hunch," undermining the World Health Organization's figures. He said that the number of coronavirus cases in the US would "going very substantially down, not up," when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said to expect more cases. And the President was contradicted by a health expert when he said a vaccine would be ready within a few months -- in reality, a vaccine could take a year or longer to develop.  "If the President can say something that's contrary to what the government's top scientists are saying, that's a really difficult and dangerous predicament," said Our Daily Planet's Korenha. "The real danger here is that people stop trusting information [from] government scientists."  The need for government transparency and readily available public information is vital in stopping the coronavirus from overrunning countries.  The media also plays a big part in making sure the public gets the information it needs in a way that's easy to understand.  The coronavirus pandemic has taken over the 24-hour news cycle, with broadcast media running almost non-stop coverage in many countries. Viewers and readers are hungry for up-to-date coronavirus information to make informed decisions about their lives.  The demand for climate change information, however, hasn't been as urgent and big climate headlines have not garnered similar rolling coverage. A study by Media Matters found that the major US broadcast networks aired just 238 minutes of climate coverage last year, making up only 0.7% of overall output.  "If climate even got one tenth of (coronavirus) coverage, how that might change public perception, how people might realize that this is a threat to them?" Korenha said.  Pivoting to the future  Coronavirus has been a stress test for countries around the world, that has put devastating strains on economies and health systems  Airlines are losing billions of dollars, thousands could lose their jobs, a global recession is around the corner and social isolation is upending daily life.  But this won't last forever. The emergency measures are short term -- until outbreaks are managed or a vaccine is developed.  The fight against the climate crisis is a long-term problem that requires completely rethinking many of our industries and ways of life. But the not responding will lead to a far worse alternative.  Climate crisis will seriously disrupt economies , reduce food security and place greater strain on health services, as a warmer world means more disease, famine, deaths from natural disasters and pollution, as well as mental health problems.  Coronavirus has shown that in order to avert the worst impacts of a global crisis, world leaders need to come together to make bold change. That means enacting policies, investing in innovative green technology, switching to clean energy and getting the public to change their daily habits.  The world has been given a trial run in global crisis management. It shouldn't waste it.
2020-03-18	(CNN) Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has offered to pay for hospital staff in London to stay at a club hotel amid the coronavirus outbreak .  Abramovich announced Wednesday that he will put up Britain's National Health Service (NHS) staff at the club's Millenium Hotel for at least the next two months as support during the virus, which has infected nearly 2,000 people in the UK.  The hotel is located inside Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's West London stadium.  "Many of the medical staff will be working long shifts and may not be able to travel home or would otherwise have to make long commutes," said a statement from the Premier League club.  "Local accommodation helps maintain the health and well-being of these crucial personnel at this critical time.  "This will be for a two-month period, and then reconsidered in light of circumstances at the time. NHS staff will be those working in hospitals in the North-west London region, but that may extend to hospitals in other districts."  NHS staff will be able to stay in a hotel at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium.  Athlete support  Other Premier League clubs have also offered support while the virus is ongoing.  Last weekend, Aston Villa and Brighton donated all their matchday food that had been prepared for subsequently postponed home games to homeless shelters, while Newcastle donated to a foodbank following their postponed home game against Sheffield United.  Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-Min donated over $82,000 (100 million won) to a non-profit organization in South Korea -- his home country where over 8,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded -- to prevent Covid-19 infection.  In this dramatic moment for Italy, we created a fundraiser for Humanitas hospitals.I count on the generosity of my colleagues and of those who want to make even a small donation. Let's together kick the CoronaVirus away and win this match! https://t.co/6o2cvUwEK6 pic.twitter.com/xhwECFFNTA — Zlatan Ibrahimović (@Ibra_official) March 18, 2020  'I want to give back'  Meanwhile, AC Milan forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has spent much of his playing career in Italy, launched a fundraiser for the country's Humanitas hospitals.  "Italy has always given me so much and in this dramatic moment I want to give back even more to this country that I love," said Ibrahimovic in light of the coronavirus' recent surge in Italy.  "I count on the generosity of my colleagues, of all professional athletes and of those who want to make a small or large donation according to the possibility (of doing so) to kick this virus away."  Football's governing body, FIFA, announced Tuesday that it will be donating $10 million to the World Health Organisation COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to "support the fight against the virus in all regions of the world."  FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on a conference call: "This exceptional situation requires exceptional measures and decisions.  "This crisis impacts the entire world and that is why solutions need to take into account the interests of all stakeholders around the world. We have shown again today a spirit of cooperation, solidarity and unity."
2020-03-18	(CNN) As the war against the merciless coronavirus rages on, health care workers nationwide are on the frontline of an unpredictable battle. While working tireless hours, those in the field often forgo their own needs.  Now, one group of University of Minnesota (UMN) Medical School students has decided to lend a hand -- not at the hospitals, but in the homes of health care professionals.  They call themselves the MN CovidSitters. Their main job? To provide health care workers in the state with the some of the things they need most at the moment, ranging from child or pet care to grocery and pharmacy runs.  The initiative, which launched on Wednesday, pairs students with health care workers, including doctors, nurses, kitchen staff, janitors and hospital administrators, across the entire state.  The idea for the program, founded by UMN second year medical students Sruthi Shankar and Sara Lederman, came after their university moved its classes online and canceled clinical rotations.  "As a medical student, it can be hard to feel so removed from everything that's going on in the world," Lederman told CNN. "Even once you're in the hospital, I think many medical students struggle to figure out how they can be most useful. One of the things that I hear my medical school peers ask a lot is 'how can I help?' With the Covid-19 outbreak, that question felt not only more relevant, but more urgent. And not only does it take a village, but it takes a brilliant, humble, determined village."  On Friday, Lederman began gathering volunteers, mostly medical, pharmacy, and nursing students, while Shankar worked on compiling a list of health care workers in need of assistance.  Within three days, the group had more than 280 student volunteers and more than 160 health care workers sign up for services.  'Superheroes in disguise'  While the students are currently matching volunteers to families using a Google form, the team is working on developing an app to automate the matching process. The group also developed a logo and website overnight.  "I've never met a lot of the people on this team and am convinced they are superheroes in disguise," Lederman said. "Everyone's superpowers are coming out. We are realizing so many of our classmates have incredible skills and talents that we didn't know about until now."  Health care workers in need of assistance are asked to fill out a form to indicate what services are needed and how urgent the request is. The students then match and connect families with two to five health professional students to establish a solid schedule.  Sara Lederman, one of the founders of MN CovidSitters and the daughter of a healthcare worker.  Families are matched with volunteer students who live nearby, with each volunteer limited to a single family. This measure was put into place to follow health experts' recommendation that Americans practice "social distancing" to help combat the spread of coronavirus.  In order to protect the students and the rest of the population from coronavirus transmission, the program does not assist workers who have experienced coronavirus symptoms in the past two weeks; traveled to a hot spot region such as China or South Korea; had contact with an individual diagnosed with coronavirus; or are not fully immunized.  Volunteers must also log their hours so in case of coronavirus exposure, the team can easily track who was exposed and limit any further spread.  From a Minnesota program to a nation wide initiative  Since the launch, the community support for the program has been "incredible," Shankar said.  The MN CovidSitters initiative has also inspired many others to start similar initiatives. The Minnesota group has been working with more than 20 other groups across the globe -- including in England and Canada -- to help launch similar programs.  "We created a Google Drive with resources to get started and included some of the main roadblocks we've encountered," Angelina Omodt-Lopez, one of the administrators of MN CovidSitters, told CNN. "We hope people will continue to share that Google Drive if it helps speed up the process of establishing other programs."  Omodt-Lopez said she feels mass interest in launching similar programs "demonstrates that health care workers across the world are in dire need of childcare assistance."  "We hope that the resources we created will help others quickly establish similar programs," she said. "We also hope that once the app is created, it will be extremely efficient for other locations to implement this sort of program."  The group is also directing all monetary contributions donated to MN CovidSitters to organizations, including food banks and homeless shelters, that serve Minnesota's most vulnerable populations  For many of the fourth-year medical students involved with MN CovidSitters, working on the initiative while dealing with the upheaval of their schoolwork has been far from easy.  Graduation has officially been canceled, and Shankar said the students have been flying on a roller coaster of emotions, dealing with the "giant wave of disappointment" after being unable to work alongside their mentors and teachers.  Still, she said, MN CovidSitters has been "a labor of love" in a time of uncertainty.  "So many of us have spent days not showering or eating just to get this project off the ground so we can serve our community."
2020-03-18	Hong Kong (CNN Business) Growing demand for 5G devices won't save the global smartphone market from the novel coronavirus pandemic, Samsung said on Wednesday.  Before the outbreak , the world's biggest smartphone maker was expecting demand to grow this year. But with the pandemic showing signs of "being prolonged, the smartphone market is contracting," DJ Koh, head of Samsung's mobile division, said at a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Koh added that he still expects demand for 5G smartphones to rise compared to last year.  Samsung SSNLF The pandemic has brought major cities around the world to a virtual standstill. South Korea, whereis based, has for weeks been dealing with one of the largest outbreaks outside of mainland China. The virus has now spread to Europe, North America and elsewhere, prompting officials to impose strict work and travel restrictions on millions. People all over the world are now hunkering down and avoiding crowded places.  Apple AAPL Foxconn HNHPF Samsung's warning on Wednesday comes just days aftersaid it was shutting down all stores outside of Greater China in an effort to contain the virus. Apple warned last month that it would miss its first quarter revenue guidance, after it had to shut down stores in mainland China and its main contract manufacturerwas forced to close factories in the country. Apple has since reopened all of its China stores.  Samsung also had to briefly shut down one of its smartphone plants in South Korea after a worker tested positive for the virus.  Read More
2020-03-18	(CNN) President Donald Trump and a top US health official cautioned young people to heed the advice to socially distance and be wary of the coronavirus pandemic even though they do not fall in the highest risk groups.  Dr. Deborah Birx said during Wednesday's briefing at the White House that the coronavirus task force is concerned about reports indicating that more young people are becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus. It suggests they may have continued to be exposed to the virus because they weren't concerned about being at risk, she said.  "There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs," Birx said.  "We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea of the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were a particular risk," she continued. "It may have been that the millennial generation ... there may be disproportional number of infections among that group and so even if it's a rare occurrence it may be seen more frequently in that group."  She also said that the task force has "not seen any significant mortality in children."  Read More
2020-03-18	Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect new developments, including Trump's claim on Monday night that he is planning to temporarily suspend immigration to the US. It originally published on March 18, 2020.  Washington (CNN) The Trump administration has made sweeping changes to the country's immigration apparatus as the US responds to the coronavirus pandemic , altering daily operations and disrupting the lives of thousands.  And there's more to come. Late Monday, President Donald Trump said he will sign an executive order temporarily suspending immigration to the US. He did not provide additional details. But immigration to the United States has largely been cut off amid the pandemic.  In a little over a month, there have been more than a dozen changes to the system, ranging from postponing immigration hearings to pausing deportation flights to certain countries to swiftly removing migrants arrested at the border and suspending refugee admissions. The tweaks to the system are being made incrementally, though rapidly, as the pandemic continues to spread across the country.  Against the backdrop of the outbreak, the Trump administration is also trying to move forward with some of its most restrictionist policies it has struggled to be put into practice, including blocking entry to asylum seekers.  Below is a list of the changes to the immigration system.  US extends travel restrictions with Canada and Mexico  April 20: Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf extended restrictions on non-essential travel on the northern and southern border. The restrictions were set to expire after being in place for nearly a month.  The administration also extended authorities that allow the US to immediately expel migrants encountered at the border, including children. CBP said earlier this month it is expelling 80% of everyone encountered in less than two hours.  Administration says it is temporarily amending visa requirements for foreign workers  April 15: The change is designed to help US agricultural employers who rely on foreign workers. Qualified employers who are concerned workers will be unable to enter the US due to travel restrictions can employ those already in the US with a certain visa status.  Among the reasons listed by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture for the temporary rule change is protecting the nation's food supply chain.  White House issues memo allowing State Department to impose visa sanctions on countries that don't repatriate citizens during the pandemic  April 10: The White House The White House released a memorandum that enables visa sanctions if a country refuses to repatriate its citizens, arguing that not accepting them poses a risk to the US amid the coronavirus pandemic.  "Countries that deny or unreasonably delay the acceptance of their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents from the United States during the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 create unacceptable public health risks for Americans," the memo reads. "The United States must be able to effectuate the repatriation of foreign nationals who violate the laws of the United States."  Guatemala has raised concerns over repatriation flights. Late last month, a Guatemalan man who was deported from the US tested positive for coronavirus. Guatemalan officials have since warned of more positive cases among deportees and suspended flights for the time being.  The memo notes that the orders are temporary and, "shall cease to apply on December 31, 2020, unless extended."  ICE releases detainees on a case-by-case basis  April 7: Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified congressional staff that it was reviewing cases of individuals in detention who may be vulnerable to the coronavirus following repeated calls from lawmakers to release detainees.  The agency said that it instructed its field offices to "further assess and consider for release certain individuals deemed to be at greater risk of exposure, consistent with CDC guidelines, reviewing cases of individuals 60 years old and older, as well as those who are pregnant."  "Additionally, efforts to identify other individuals who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19, based on risk factors identified by the CDC, other than age and pregnancy, are ongoing, based on the recommendations of CDC," ICE said.  Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli has since told reporters that ICE released nearly 700 people from custody after conducting medical reviews stemming from concerns about the coronavirus.  Trump administration extends postponement of immigration hearings for "remain in Mexico" cases  April 1:The Trump administration extended the postponement of immigration hearings scheduled through May 1 for migrants waiting in Mexico, according to a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department.  All scheduled hearings will be rescheduled.  Thousands of migrants are waiting in Mexico for their immigration court date in the US as part of the administration's so-called "remain in Mexico" policy.  Border agency says unaccompanied migrant children will be subject to new border rules  March 30: Customs and Border Protection, an agency within DHS, said in a statement that Customs and Border Protection, an agency within DHS, said in a statement that minors could be included in new coronavirus restrictions on the border , meaning children who arrive alone at the border could be sent to their origin country instead of turned over to the Health and Human Services Department, which is typically charged with their care. Initially, the agency said children would be exempt.  Of the more than 6,000 migrants expelled in March under the new restrictions, 299 were children who arrived alone and 393 were family members.  State Department suspends routine visa services  March 20: The department, citing worldwide challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic, The department, citing worldwide challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic, temporarily suspended routine visa services at US embassies and consulates. Services to US citizens continue to proceed.  The State Department later updated its guidance to tell foreign medical professionals with approved visa petitions, or who are eligible for an approved exchange visitor program, to request an appointment at their nearest embassy or consulate.  US and Mexico limit cross-border travel  March 20: The US and Mexico announced they're limiting nonessential travel across their shared border to curb movement during the pandemic. Exceptions include traveling for medical purposes or work, or to attend school, among others, The US and Mexico announced they're limiting nonessential travel across their shared border to curb movement during the pandemic. Exceptions include traveling for medical purposes or work, or to attend school, among others, according to a regulation notice set to be published March 24  The US also took the step of barring entry to migrants illegally crossing the southern border. At the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security will suspend entry of all migrants "seeking to enter the US without proper travel documentation" -- for both the northern and southern border, acting Secretary Chad Wolf said.  Migrants who are apprehended at the border will either be quickly removed or repatriated to their origin countries.  ICE changes immigration enforcement operations  March 18: ICE told congressional staffers that it has temporarily adjusted its "enforcement posture," according to a memo obtained by CNN, marking a change in operations as a result of the pandemic. The agency said it will focus on those who pose a public safety risk and are "subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds."  Immigrant advocates have called on ICE to dial back operations amid the coronavirus outbreak, arguing that the agency has instilled fear in the immigrant community and might discourage some from seeking medical attention.  The agency said in its memo to staffers that it will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, "except in the most extraordinary circumstances," adding that individuals should not avoid seeking medical care over fears of enforcement.  DOJ closes more immigration courts, postpones hearings  March 18: The Justice Department The Justice Department closed an additional 10 immigration courts , spread across the country and postponed all hearings of cases of immigrants who are not in detention. The Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, had previously made incremental changes, to the frustration of immigration judges, lawyers, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors, who urged the administration to close courts for the safety of staff and immigrants.  Refugee admissions paused  March 18: The United States The United States paused refugee admissions . The move comes after the International Organization for Migration, which is in charge of booking refugees' travel, and the UN refugee agency announced a suspension of resettlement travel. The agencies shared concerns in a statement, saying international travel "could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus."  ICE suspends some deportation flights  March 18: ICE told CNN that removal flights to Italy, China and South Korea have been suspended. While the situation is quickly evolving, however, ICE is continuing to deport immigrants. Prior to boarding, however, immigrants undergo a temperature screening. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher is referred to a medical provider, according to ICE told CNN that removal flights to Italy, China and South Korea have been suspended. While the situation is quickly evolving, however, ICE is continuing to deport immigrants. Prior to boarding, however, immigrants undergo a temperature screening. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher is referred to a medical provider, according to ICE's website . ICE has since updated its guidance to include any detainee with a temperature of 99 degrees or higher.  USCIS suspends in-person services  March 17: US Citizenship and Immigration Services US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it's suspending its in-person services , including all interviews and naturalization ceremonies, to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus. USCIS is responsible for administering the nation's legal immigration system, including green cards, citizenship and asylum and refugee processing. It administers naturalization ceremonies across the country -- one of the most public and cherished duties the agency carries out. The suspension remains in effect.  ICE reschedules in-person check-ins and pushes back timeline for recent arrivals  March 17: ICE notified congressional staffers that it will temporarily reschedule in-person appointments of immigrants who are not in detention to "minimize the impact" of coronavirus. The agency will also allow those recently released from the southern border to check in at 60 days, instead of 30 days.  Guatemala says it's suspending asylum agreement with US  March 17: An asylum agreement between the United States and Guatemala was suspended out of caution over the coronavirus, An asylum agreement between the United States and Guatemala was suspended out of caution over the coronavirus, Guatemala's government announced , a setback for the Trump administration, which has increasingly relied on its accord with the country to curb asylum. The move came a day after Alejandro Giammattei, president of Guatemala, said the country was closing its borders in an attempt to prevent the virus's spread.  US extends travel restrictions to the UK and Ireland  March 16: Americans, legal permanent residents and their immediate families returning from Ireland and the United Kingdom began to be funneled into 13 select US airports, where they went through enhanced screening, Americans, legal permanent residents and their immediate families returning from Ireland and the United Kingdom began to be funneled into 13 select US airports, where they went through enhanced screening, according to the Department of Homeland Security . The two countries had been initially excluded from travel restrictions related to coronavirus.  ICE announces a temporary end to social visitation at detention facilities  March 13: ICE said it ceased social visitation in all of its detention facilities. The agency had previously announced that it had put protocols in place, in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to protect staff and detainees.  US implements Europe travel restrictions  March 13: The Trump administration The Trump administration added more countries to its list of travel restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier this year, the administration had restricted travel from China and Iran. Most foreign nationals who were in Europe's Schengen Area -- 26 countries stretching from Iceland to Greece -- in the past 14 days are barred from entering the US. American citizens, green card holders and immediate family members are exempt from the travel ban but will face additional health screening and restrictions when they arrive. The restrictions led to prolonged wait times at select airports, with passengers squeezed together and waiting to get through US customs, after returning from overseas.  Migrant children no longer placed in Washington state and California  March 10: The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency tasked with the care of migrant children, The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency tasked with the care of migrant children, temporarily stopped placing kids who arrive in the US without parents or guardians in shelters in California and Washington state, unless in limited circumstances. The Health and Human Services Department funds a network of more than 100 facilities where migrant children are cared for until they're released to sponsors in the United States. The children are turned over to HHS after being taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security.  The agency has also since stopped placements in New York.
2020-03-18	King County in Washington state is taking over a public soccer field to use as a hospital for people who may have coronavirus.  The facility in Shoreline is designed to accommodate up to 200 beds, according to an announcement from the city. Shoreline officials said they are hoping to save traditional hospital beds only for people with the most serious needs if there is a surge in suspected coronavirus patients.  A video from CNN affiliate KOMO shows a group of workers on Wednesday laying construction materials on the field.  However, city officials said the hospital will not be allowed to operate unless all city regulations are followed, including obtaining a permit. It is unclear when the hospital will open.
2020-03-18	(CNN) Passing through airports in Hong Kong and Tokyo this week highlighted the differences in the approaches of the two Asian hubs in dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Upon arrival at Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday, after disembarking directly onto the tarmac we were taken to a quarantine area on the lower level of the airport.  There we underwent multiple health and security checks. My temperature was taken, I filled out a detailed questionnaire indicating I had not traveled to China, Italy, South Korea, or other coronavirus hotspots.  Two quarantine officers gave me a checklist of instructions for after I left the airport, including that I take my temperature twice daily and immediately report any abnormal symptoms to the Department of Health.  If I was to land in Hong Kong today, it would be even stricter.  Read More
2020-03-19	A version of this story appeared in the March 19 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.  (CNN) There's a ray of hope emanating from the first epicenter of the outbreak. For the first time since the pandemic began, China announced no new locally transmitted infections today, marking a turning point in the global battle to contain Covid-19.  The milestone will likely be held up as proof that China's sweeping, top-down efforts to control the virus are working, despite persistent allegations that local officials mishandled the initial outbreak. But the draconian restrictions have exacted a deep toll on the millions of Chinese forced into lockdown, not to mention China's economy, Ben Westcott and Shanshan Wang write  Still, it's a pivotal moment as global infections top 200,000, with every continent except for Antarctica now grappling with mounting crises of their own.  In the US, where a fumbled initial government response put America on the back foot, officials are now preparing for a very long fight. A 100-page federal plan on how to tackle the pandemic obtained by CNN shows the Trump administration is making contingency plans that could stretch up to "18 months or longer" and could include "multiple waves of illness." Hospitals have already sounded the alarm on quickly vanishing supplies as the virus in the US shows no signs of slowing -- in just 24 hours, cases soared by more than 40%.  Meanwhile, in Italy, which has entered its fourth week of its worst national crisis since World War II, there's seemingly no end in sight. Yesterday, Italy recorded the highest number of fatalities in a single day of any nation in the world since the outbreak began : 475 people died. Italian doctors are hoping for a sign that the country's blanket lockdown is working, because there's no plan B, Barbie Nadeau write s.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Countries splash cash, but markets aren't impressed  The Trump administration yesterday joined governments globally in broadening its response, signing into law an emergency aid package that includes provisions for free testing and paid sick leave. Details of a separate $1 trillion stimulus plan are also coming into focus -- one Treasury memo suggests it could include a combined $500 billion in checks to Americans.  But the news that countries across the globe are intervening in big ways to prevent economic meltdown has done little to stop markets from plunging . US futures and Asian stocks sank today, and currency markets were also incredibly volatile as investors piled into the US dollar.  For the first time since 9/11 the frenzied floor of the New York Stock Exchange will shut as trading becomes fully electronic on Monday. And the entire Trump stock rally, which seemed at its peak last month to be unending, is nearly gone  Tempers fray as cases rise in US  The virus has upended the Democratic primary race, sickened at least two members of Congress (prompting others to self-quarantine) and put lawmakers on edge. When asked by CNN's Manu Raju about his campaign, US Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suggested he had other a few other things on his plate : "I'm dealing with a f**king global crisis ... right now I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die. Is that enough for you to keep me busy for today?"  'Take it seriously'  "Since World War II, there has never been a challenge for our country in which acting in solidarity was so very crucial," Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday in a televised address to Germany, which now has more than 8,000 cases. While European leaders have come together to ban all entry to non-EU citizens for the next month, there are signs the virus has strained the bloc's unity. The governments of Germany, Poland and Hungary have either wholly or partially shut down their own land borders inside the EU, creating traffic jams and leaving drivers waiting for hours.  Elsewhere, many US counties have now issued "shelter in place" orders (we explain what that means in the Q&A section below) and the UK is considering a partial London lockdown after finally announcing it will shut schools long after many of its neighbors did, while Australia and New Zealand are both banning entry to foreign citizens and non-residents.  Text message rumors  Have you received a dubious text message forwarded from a reliable friend, claiming to have inside knowledge about the coronavirus? You're not alone.  Efforts to provide the public with accurate and timely information are being undermined by the spread of medical misinformation and fake cures. Some of that is coming from pro-Kremlin media , which EU officials say are trying to sow "panic" in the West by waging a disinformation coronavirus campaign. And many misleading claims are circulating on WhatsApp, bringing the Facebook-owned company, under renewed scrutiny, Hadas Gold and Donie O'Sullivan write  ON OUR RADAR  TODAY'S TOP TIP  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.  Q: Is it OK to go outside under a "shelter in place" order?  A: The overarching idea is to keep people away from each other -- social distancing. There is nothing inherently dangerous about going outside. In fact, it's good for you -- mentally and physically. Everyone needs some fresh air, sunlight & exercise. True isolation is not advised unless you're very sick (or unless you're advised to do so by local authorities).  DO: Walk, bike, run -- but make sure you can do it in a solitary manner (maintaining at least six feet) and still practice good hygiene.  DON'T: Congregate at bars/restaurants, playing team sports, going to the beach in droves.  Thousands of people have asked us questions about the outbreak.

Coronavirus  The US government is now preparing for 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic , including multiple waves of illnesses. The ominous announcement comes after cases in the US spiked 40% in just 24 hours. About 9,000 Americans have now tested positive for the virus, and at least 149 have died. Singapore also reported its biggest single-day jump in cases, and South Korea, which has been watching the number of infections slow with reserved optimism, is now seeing a new spike in cases and clusters. Meanwhile, India is bracing for the arrival of 26,000 people from the Persian Gulf region, mostly blue-collar workers returning home from labor contracts in Gulf countries. The new arrivals will be quarantined for 14 days. And there is some brighter news out of China: The country has reported no new local infections for the first time since the pandemic began months ago, marking a critical step in containment. Follow along here for the latest.  2. Election 2020  States are struggling with how to handle primary elections amid health fears and self-isolation. The debate has led Wisconsin Democrats to file suit to block state voting laws that they say would force people to choose between their health and their right to vote. The plaintiffs want to extend the deadline for online registration, ease photo and absentee ballot requests, and extend the absentee mail-in ballot deadline ahead of the state's primary on April 7. If the regulations aren't eased, people will have to leave home to complete the paperwork necessary to vote. Other states have postponed primaries over health concerns.

Immigration  While Americans are adjusting to life under pandemic precautions, the Trump administration had made a dozen changes to the US immigration system in a little over a week. The Department of Justice closed immigration courts and postponed hearings. Guatemala suspended its asylum agreement with the US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement adjusted its enforcement priorities, focusing on those who pose a public safety risk. ICE also said it will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, except in "extraordinary circumstances." And, refugee admissions have been paused . While some of these changes are temporary and in line with other public health measures, they also align with restrictionist policies that Trump officials have struggled to put into practice.

The bill has attracted vocal opposition, and a federal judge even struck down a very similar attempt at a ban in the state two years ago. Critics and LGBT rights groups are not only frustrated that the bill may be approved by the governor, inviting further litigation, but also because many feel state leaders should be focusing on responding to the coronavirus instead.

2020-03-19	US stocks closed higher on Thursday, eking out steady gains in the afternoon following a morning of volatile trading.  The Dow swung more than 1,200 points from its low to its high point. It finished up nearly 1%, or 188 points. It was the first time since March 6 that the index closed within 1,000 points from where it opened .  The S&P 500 closed up 0.5%, also by far its most modest finish since the start of the month.  The Nasdaq Composite, which was the best performer of the day, ended up 2.3%.
2020-03-19	New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is facing a monumental challenge: It must prevent the rapidly intensifying health crisis from morphing into a full-blown financial crisis.  To meet that threat, the Fed is dusting off a playbook it surely hoped it wouldn't need to turn to again, at least not so soon: the steps it took as the Great Recession took hold.  That 2008 playbook has led the US central bank to swiftly slash interest rates back to zero , relaunch a $700 billion bond-buying program and quickly roll out lending facilities designed to unclog pipelines that keep credit flowing around the world.  Yet the Fed is likely just geting started. Analysts say authorities will need to keep working to break the logjams that are forming in financial markets. The risk is that the central banks moves too slowly, allowing fear and liquidity squeezes to spark a financial crisis that deepens what could already be a painful recession.  Indeed, just in the past few days the Fed has revived a series of 2008 crisis-era programs.  First, the US central bank invoked emergency powers on Tuesday to launch a commercial paper lending facility.  The program is aimed at unfreezing a $1 trillion short-term lending market that Corporate America uses to pay workers and finance inventories. A similar move by the Ben Bernanke-led Fed in 2008 helped prevent the collapse of companies like General Electric that relied on commercial paper.  "Commercial pipelines are the lifelines of businesses," Richard Fisher, former president of the Dallas Fed during the 2008 crisis, told CNN Business. "They are clogged up due to the virus and must be unclogged and remain open."  'Liquidity squeeze'  Hours later on Tuesday, the Fed again invoked emergency powers to unveil a separate lending facility that seeks to ease emerging liquidity squeezes on Wall Street.  Bank of America BAC Goldman Sachs GS Deutsche Bank DB JPMorgan Chase JPM Wells Fargo WFC Known as the primary dealer credit facility, the crisis-era program offers cheap financing for up to 90 days to the 24 trading desks that interact directly with the Fed. Those so-called primary dealers include major investment banks such as BMO Capital,and  "This was the logical next step as the Federal Reserve goes all out to end the liquidity logjams that are hurting the financial system and resulting in less available credit," Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.  The Fed said in a statement that the credit facility, which officially launches on Friday, will enable Wall Street firms to keep markets operating smoothly and credit flowing to businesses and households.  It was required by stress in the system.  "We have heard complaints for several days that primary dealers were suffering from a liquidity squeeze," Seiberg wrote. "That message apparently made it to the Federal Reserve."  Huge demand for dollars  Late Wednesday, the Fed launched a facility designed to help money market mutual funds cope with an exodus of cash from nervous investors. The backstop is supported by $10 billion from the Treasury Department and aims to boost liquidity in money markets.  And on Thursday the Fed expanded an emergency program that provides dollars to foreign central banks. The move, which is trying to ease a dollar shortage, expands the currency swaps to Australia, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea.  At the same time, the Fed is pumping staggering amounts of cash into the financial system to ease strains that keep popping up.  The New York Fed has repeatedly stepped up its overnight repo operations, promising Tuesday to offer $1 trillion per day this week. The Fed's intensifying steps reflect the scale of the liquidity squeeze.  Last week, the NY Fed offered $1.5 trillion to fight "highly unusual disruptions," particularly in the Treasury market where analysts said liquidity evaporated. The Fed is hoping the cash injections unstick the markets.  Now what?  Seiberg said pressure is mounting on the Fed to build a broader credit facility that could quickly get low-cost loans to individuals and businesses hurt by the coronavirus.  Goldman Sachs said there are other crisis-era facilities the Fed could bring back to fight the coronavirus fallout.  And if the credit freeze becomes more widespread, Goldman Sachs said the Fed could bring back the term asset loan facility , which was used during the Great Recession to incentivize investors to extend credit to consumers and businesses.  "The sheer amount of cash and credit that will be needed to sustain businesses and workers for a shutdown that could be measured in months rather than weeks is beyond what we believe banks can provide on their own," Seiberg wrote.
2020-03-19	Washington (CNN) Millennials may just have the opportunity to rebrand what it means to be American, as did many of their predecessors, including the "Greatest Generation," dubbed so for their sacrifices during World War II.  Sure, there's plenty of blame to go around for the scary state of affairs regarding the novel coronavirus , especially when it comes to the American government: Why weren't we prepared? Why has President Donald Trump  Still, the question to ask is: What do we owe one another?  As the virus rapidly worsens in America, images at odds with the reality of a pandemic -- one whose power derives from proximity -- are circulating around social media: People crowded into bars , drinking their green beer at St. Patrick's Day parties. People packed onto beaches , taking advantage of the warming weather.  These revelers tend to be young: many of them members of the expansive millennial cohort bookended by mid-twentysomethings and those right under the age of 40 -- that is, the people whom the virus is, on balance, least likely to be fatal to.  It's this apparent forever-young callousness -- or obliviousness -- that's touched a raw nerve.  "To all you young millennial a**holes who keep going out and partying, go home," the actress and singer Hilary Duff said in an Instagram Story on Sunday.  Dr. Deborah Birx, a top US health official, explained during Wednesday's White House briefing that there's worry about reports indicating that more young people are becoming seriously ill from the virus. This suggests that they may have continued to be exposed to it because they weren't concerned about being at risk, she said.  "There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs," Birx said. "We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea of the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were a particular risk."  The sharp attention many are directing at millennials in the face of the pandemic is revealing: of, for one thing, deeper expectations of social responsibility -- our obligation to one another on account of our profound interdependence.  What makes Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, uniquely difficult to contain is its stealthiness. It can be transmitted to the vulnerable -- the elderly, those with autoimmune conditions -- by people who might believe themselves invincible.  Millennials and other young people , then, arguably play an outsized part in stemming the virus. Instead of gathering and posing dangers not necessarily to themselves but to others, they ought to stay home. And while they're there, think a bit creatively about how to distribute help -- the concept of mutual aid , say -- to neighbors who could very well be in dire need of it.  Of course, it's not just millennials who are disregarding social-distancing guidelines. Baby boomers are doing it, too, and at times despite the protests of their millennial relatives . In this light, the intense scrutiny of millennials is perhaps indicative of something else, too: dusty generational fault lines.  "The old alchemical dream was changing base metals into gold. The new alchemical dream is: changing one's personality -- remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one's very self ... and observing, studying, and doting on it," he wrote of the generation's navel-gazing.  Millennials aren't beyond the reach of such sweeping characterization. Recall the 2013 Time magazine cover story in which the writer Joel Stein labeled millennials the "Me Me Me Generation." There's also the laundry list of things they've been accused of killing : marriage, department stores, running, napkins, wine corks. It isn't difficult to see how a cohort whose perceived self-centeredness has allegedly ruined so much might also spring to mind amid the current crisis.
2020-03-19	Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University. His new book is "Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.  (CNN) We won't know for many weeks, and maybe many months, the full impact Covid-19 will have on the health of Americans -- how many will be hospitalized and how many will die. We do know that it already has dealt a devastating blow to the US economy. Before too long, many Americans are going to demand to know why the United States failed to adequately prepare for one of the most significant crises since World War II; a crisis that was both foreseeable and foreseen. The United States will need to create a commission to investigate that question, if only to make sure the nation is prepared for the next pandemic.  The United States has often turned to investigative commissions to examine why a crisis happened and how the government might better respond in the future. Following the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration quickly investigated what had happened. Within seven weeks of the attack the Roberts Commission, which was appointed by FDR, issued its first report, one of multiple official inquiries into Pearl Harbor that were convened as World War II raged on.  By contrast, the George W. Bush administration initially thwarted a special commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks. Following intense public pressure from the victims' families the Bush administration reluctantly acceded to an investigative commission more than a year after the attacks.  Sure, there will likely be push back from the Trump administration about the need for a coronavirus commission, but such an investigation is vital to understand how we might better prepare for the next pandemic or a possible bioterrorism attack, since they have some commonalities.  Here are some questions such a commission might try to answer:  -- Why was it that the United States had tested such a small number of people for the coronavirus so many weeks into the crisis? In the weeks since Covid-19 first appeared in the United States, the CDC has, as of Tuesday, together with other public health laboratories, carried out some 32,000 tests. Meanwhile, South Korea has tested more than a quarter million people -- more than 7.5 times more than the United States. What did South Korea, a nation whose total population is only about 15% that of the United States, get right about its tests that America did not? A smart early decision by the Trump administration came at the end of January, which was to bar non-US citizens who had recently visited China from entering the United States and also to quarantine Americans who had visited China's Hubei province , the epicenter of the virus. But why didn't the administration use the weeks of additional time that this bought the American public to do anything substantially to prepare for the crisis by, for instance, speeding up the availability of tests?  -- Why didn't the government step in to make sure we had enough medical-grade masks for what promised to be vastly increased hospital occupancy? According to The New York Times on March 9, "The federal government's Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks -- only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels" -- which, of course, it already has. Knowing that hospitals run on limited inventory , the federal government should have anticipated that supplies would run short.  -- Why might we face inadequate numbers of ventilators for the patients who might become critically ill? Following a tabletop exercise, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security warned in 2018 that in the event of a severe pandemic there would be a shortfall of hundreds of thousands of ventilators in the United States. This warning seems to have been largely ignored.  -- Why did President Trump repeatedly mislead the public about the scale of the threat? Trump said February 26 there were only 15 coronavirus cases in the United States and that the number would soon be close to zero. And as recently as Sunday, Trump made the nonsensical claim that "we have tremendous control" of the virus . Trump's other absurd claim earlier this month that "anybody who wants a test can get a test" was about as accurate as his assessment that his handling of the crisis is rated "a 10."  -- Why did other senior Trump administration officials also mislead the American public? On March 6 , the counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway, told reporters the virus was "being contained." That same day, Larry Kudlow, the top economic adviser to the President, advised that Americans "should stay at work." Luckily, many Americans ignored that advice and with scant guidance from their own government proactively started telecommuting last week.  -- What role did right-wing media play in downplaying the crisis and how did that affect sentiments among many Republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped? Last week, Fox Business anchor Trish Regan told viewers that Democrats were creating "mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off ... to demonize and destroy the President." Regan's show is now no longer on the air, but night after night, Sean Hannity , the most-watched anchor on cable news,  downplayed the virus, for instance saying February 27, "Tonight, I can report the sky is absolutely falling. We're all doomed. The end is near. The apocalypse is imminent, and you're going to all die, all of you in the next 48 hours and it's all President Trump's fault. Or at least that's what the media mob and the Democratic extreme radical socialist party would like you to think." This past weekend, close Trump ally, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) encouraged healthy viewers watching Fox Business to go to their local bar . All this was particularly irresponsible since the Fox audience skews elderly and therefore includes many people particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.  -- One of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which in its 2017 Worldwide Threat Assessment warned : "A novel or reemerging microbe that is easily transmissible between humans and is highly pathogenic remains a major threat because such an organism has the potential to spread rapidly and kill millions. ... The World Bank has estimated that a severe global influenza pandemic could cost the equivalent of 4.8 percent of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion, during the course of an outbreak." In its 2019 threat assessment ODNI warned, that "the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources..." Why were these warnings not acted upon effectively?  The 9/11 Commission provides an excellent model of how to create a successful coronavirus commission. Lee Hamilton, a former longtime Democratic congressman from Indiana, and Thomas Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, led the commission. They both had many decades of public service between them so they really understood how the government works and they were known for their probity, smarts and fairness.  Kean and Hamilton oversaw a bipartisan group of knowledgeable commissioners and staff who held a series of public hearings that ultimately produced an authoritative report about how 9/11 happened , which also became a bestselling book  The 9/11 Commission also made important recommendations about how the government should be reconfigured to protect the United States from another catastrophic terrorist attack, including the establishment of the National Counterterrorism Center to integrate intelligence from all the multiple US intelligence agencies to better "connect the dots."

Both of these recommendations were implemented and they have generally worked well and have helped to keep Americans safe.  A coronavirus commission could be led by widely respected politicians from both parties who are steeped in national security issues such as Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- or by former government officials with deep expertise in national security such as Richard Danzig, the former secretary of the Navy under President Barack Obama and Fran Townsend, George W. Bush's homeland security adviser.  Such a commission would help to ensure that we don't bungle the response when the next pandemic, inevitably, comes.
2020-03-19	CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, has now finished. Here's what was discussed:  Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases, said it is just the "very beginning" of a long process of research and studies.  Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while "there is no design study that has proven that you are 'protected'" from getting reinfected, "projecting what we know about viruses, I would say that there is a very good chance that you're protected."  Young people need to take pandemic seriously: "We are getting more and more information that someone can transmit even when they are asymptomatic. So in order to protect oneself, society and particularly the vulnerable people, we've really got to adhere to the physical separation," said Fauci.  Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that, "it is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity."  Assessing your own mental health: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down.

It was Mother's Day in the United States.  The novel coronavirus has now spread across the world.  The illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province. It has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica, and many countries have declared a national emergency.  The World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, the first since the H1N1 flu in 2009.  Coronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold or flu. But for those with a weaker immune system, the virus could cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis.
2020-03-19	Washington (CNN) Travel restrictions, orders to stay home, TSA officers testing positive for coronavirus and public fear are killing demand for air travel, which could make a domestic travel ban under consideration by the Trump administration largely irrelevant.  The idea of grounding many or all domestic flights remains under consideration at the White House, where the administration's coronavirus task force is looking for ways to prevent people from congregating and spreading the virus.  The government's decision to restrict travel to China, South Korea, and much of Europe already brought a precipitous decline in airline service to overseas destinations.  Such a drastic move domestically could further cripple the nation's economy, and have negative effects such as preventing the flow of cargo, making it harder to ship medical supplies and other essential goods.  "Fauci is still pushing for it -- and maybe he's right," said one senior administration official, referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the most visible faces on the administration's task force. The NIAID did not immediately comment.  "We're not there yet. That doesn't mean never," the official continued. "But the President and a lot of us around him feel we should do everything we can to avoid it."  Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, said Thursday night on Fox News that President Donald Trump hadn't ruled out a federal shutdown.  "As President Trump has said from the beginning, everything is on the table. Every day we go over data, we review it and use science and data to drive policy and decision-making." Birx said.  A massive reduction in service is already happening before their eyes.  Last week triggered a "rapid deterioration" for airlines which led them to request financial relief from the government, explained an airlines source. Planes were flying 85-100% full pretty much across the board at the beginning of this year, and now they are closer to 50% full and in many cases much less, the official said. Airlines need planes to be about 65% full to break even and make the flight worth flying, the official added.  The topic of grounding all domestic flights was not raised in a call Trump held this week with the CEOs of major US airlines and air cargo carriers, according to a source familiar with the conversation.  Another person familiar with the discussions said the administration's coronavirus task force has not pressured airlines to completely shut down.  A 'virtual shutdown'  The airlines are parking hundreds of airplanes -- with American and Delta each parking around half their fleets -- and canceling flights en masse as travelers abandon their bookings faster than they make new reservations.  American said Thursday it plans to cancel 55,000 flights next month but warned it expects "demand to fall even more before it gets better."  The airlines do not plan to go to zero domestic flights, but it could "get pretty close to zero" so that it would be a "virtual shutdown," according to one of the industry sources.  One school of thought in the aviation industry: While there may not be a ban, per se, the economic conditions will likely continue to considerably limit the viability of operating domestic flights.  It's happening day by day, with airlines cutting capacity, and it's almost certain to continue.  The latest example came Thursday, when Minneapolis-based Compass Air, which operates flights on behalf of American and Delta, said it would cease to operate on April 7 because of falling demand in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Compass flies 6 million customers annually with an average of 280 departures per day to more than 40 destinations.  Feds to require flights on certain routes?  As airlines cut back, some within the industry believe that major routes will be mandated by the government, such as between Washington, DC and Los Angeles, according to an industry source.  That could lead to the elimination of service to smaller or mid-sized cities.  One of the possibilities, the industry source said, would be restricting flights to essential business travel only -- but airlines, at this point, are happy to take anyone who is healthy and willing to fly.  Airlines could also be forced to end service if the airports they fly in and out of stop operations.  On the heels of the airline industry's request for more than $50 billion in US government support, an industry group representing airports requested a $10 billion package from the government and warned it could default on bonds.  The Federal Aviation Administration told CNN it "does not permit airports that receive federal funds to shut down without agency approval."  Cargo needs  One of the factors keeping planes flying right now is the role that aviation plays in moving goods across the country.  "If airplanes don't fly, cargo doesn't fly," one administration official said. "We have to keep the transportation network up and running."  The International Air Transport Association, whose members include several US airlines, said this week it is urging governments around the world to "take urgent measures to ensure that air cargo will be available to support the global fight against COVID-19."  Sara Nelson, president of Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, told CNN a ban on domestic flights should be implemented only if health experts believe it truly necessary because "airlines provide the ability to move equipment and experts around."  Smooth air travel is necessary "in order to move goods and supplies in order to eradicate this," she said.
2020-03-20	Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images  An annual tradition for both Washingtonians and tourists are to see the cherry blossoms bloom every Spring.  But the threat of spreading coronavirus has prompted the city's public transit system to take additional steps to its already altered scheduled to discourage people from using the public transportation system to go see them during peak bloom.  Trains will be running on a 30-minute operating schedule, and buses will operate on a Sunday schedule, system officials announced in a Friday statement.  The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority also reminded riders two of its stations — Smithsonian and Arlington Cemetery — close to the Tidal Basin where much of the cherry blossoms bloom will remain closed.  Of course, people continue to show up and look at the bloom, including somebody who broke one of the fragile trees, according to the National Park Service.  Organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival had already announced last week it would be canceling its annual event due to the coronavirus outbreak.  For people who are stuck in the nation's capital or otherwise can't get to DC, the National Mall has a webcam to view the cherry blossoms around the Tidal Basin.
2020-03-20	Dr. Tom Frieden is the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department. He is currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives , a global non-profit initiative funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and part of the global non-profit Vital Strategies . Resolve to Save Lives works with countries to prevent 100 million deaths and to make the world safer from epidemics. Dr. Frieden is also senior fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) Different times call for different measures. When Covid-19 hit China, I was concerned, as were many public health professionals, about what could happen and urged rapid action to understand more and prepare. But few of us anticipated the catastrophic impact the new virus has had in Wuhan , in Italy and may soon have in many other places.  For most people, there is simply no frame of reference for this pandemic. Never in our lifetime has there been an infectious disease threat as devastating to society. Never in our lifetime have we seen a rich country like Italy face the need to ration respirators . And never have we seen the fear that millions of health care workers around the world feel about being infected by the virus -- justified fear we must address.  What we're learning about the novel coronavirus  We learn more about this virus by the day, often by the hour and most of the news is bad. Here are five things we've learned in the past week:  It's not just older people with underlying conditions who become very ill and can die. Younger adults, previously healthy people and some children develop viral pneumonia. Although prior reports suggested that 80% of people got only mild disease, it now appears that about half of these people, despite not needing hospital admission, have moderately severe pneumonia, which can take weeks or longer to recover from.  Explosive spread will almost certainly overwhelm health care capacity in New York City and elsewhere, and lead to the inability to save patients who could otherwise have been saved. Today's severe cases are in people infected 10 to 14 days ago who got sick five to six days ago and have steadily progressed to severe illness. That means cases will continue to skyrocket for weeks after spread stops. Not only won't there be enough ventilators, there won't be enough supplies for the ventilators, hospital beds to support patients -- or health care workers to help patients.  Health care workers are in peril. Thousands were infected in China, more than 3,000 have been infected in Italy, protective equipment is in short supply in the United States, and as health care becomes overwhelmed, it becomes harder to provide care safely.  It's going to get a lot worse. Not only is the global economy in free-fall but supply chains for essentials, including medicines, are disrupted. Even China, which has successfully tamped down spread, is only now reopening its economy -- which produces components of many medicines people rely on -- and very slowly.  This is a war. And in war, strategy is important. The leading concept, now remarkably widely understood, is flattening the curve . This is an important tactic to protect patients and health care workers from a surge that can overwhelm our hospitals, increase death rates and put health care workers' lives at risk. But it is not a strategy. A month ago today, my organization, which focuses on preventing epidemics, published a concept of operations showing the shading of containment into mitigation, and the need to pause contact tracing when it became impractical and scale up social distancing interventions (see link for details.)  Today, learning from another month of experience from around the world, particularly China and South Korea , we recognize a third phase of the response: suppression of episodic outbreaks. In this new third phase, extensive testing and alert clinical systems can identify cases and clusters promptly, intervene extensively and suppress spread before widespread societal harms occur.  The revised approach also recognizes that this is going to be a long war, and that we need to address the extensive risks to societal continuity, including health care for people with ongoing medical needs such as hypertension and diabetes, and the vulnerability of the supply chain for medicines and supplies.  China has outlined an analogous approach, based in part on their experience with cases re-imported from other parts of the world. In China, Hubei province faced a peak that overwhelmed health care services, but other provinces were able to avoid this through aggressive containment (the purple curve below). China remains largely locked down, with only gradual reopening, and is urgently expanding health care capacity, preparing for possible clusters or larger outbreaks in the future.  There are five priorities essential for successful implementation of the third phase of this strategy.  Extensive testing and contact tracing. China has tested millions of people and traced more than 685,000 contacts. Contact tracing requires skilled public health professionals -- and sophisticated data management. Testing is required in multiple venues:  Health care facilities. Every patient with fever or cough and every patient requiring mechanical ventilation or with signs or symptoms of pneumonia.  Every patient with fever or cough and every patient requiring mechanical ventilation or with signs or symptoms of pneumonia. Contact tracing. An army of skilled public health workers, potentially empowered by new data streams such as cell phone location trails, are needed to identify exposed people, who must be isolated for 14 days after exposure. How widely a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test contacts will depend on emerging information about who spreads the infection and when in the course of their illness.

How widely a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test contacts will depend on emerging information about who spreads the infection and when in the course of their illness. Drive-through. Quick, safe, convenient drive-through testing facilities, as pioneered by South Korea, reduce the burden on health care facilities, reduce the risk to health care workers and others who patients may come into contact with, and identify infections among contacts and others.  Quick, safe, convenient drive-through testing facilities, as pioneered by South Korea, reduce the burden on health care facilities, reduce the risk to health care workers and others who patients may come into contact with, and identify infections among contacts and others. Surveillance. We need tracking systems, including the Influenza-Like Illness system, to find spread and monitor trends. Syndromic surveillance systems will need to be tuned to detect possible clusters, and signals investigated immediately.  Prepare for health care to surge safely. Every community in the country needs to ramp up the ability to safely care for large number of patients with minimal risk to health care staff. This means not only flexing up the number of beds and availability of oxygen and ventilators, but every aspect of health care including staffing, equipment, supplies and overall management.  Preserve health and routine health care functions. We need to increase the resilience of both our people and our health care facilities, as rapidly as possible.  Increase personal health resilience . Underlying conditions greatly increase the risk of severe illness. This isn't just bad for patients who get infected, it will take up scarce health care facilities. There has never been a better time to quit smoking, get your blood pressure under control, make sure that if you have diabetes it's well controlled, and -- yes -- get regular physical activity. (Being active outside for at least 15 minutes a day also helps with vitamin D levels. Of all of the various proposed measures to increase your resistance to infection, regular physical activity and adequate vitamin D levels probably have the most scientific evidence to support them -- and can be done safely.)  .

Massively scale up telemedicine. We need to reduce the number of people attending health care facilities while at the same time preserving and improving health. The Administration issued flexible and constructive guidelines for Medicaid, but much more is needed. Patients -- especially those who are uninsured or who don't have a regular source of care -- need to be able to refill prescriptions, get medical advice and find a clinician readily.

The Administration issued flexible and constructive guidelines for Medicaid, but much more is needed. Patients -- especially those who are uninsured or who don't have a regular source of care -- need to be able to refill prescriptions, get medical advice and find a clinician readily. Fix supply chain weaknesses. This is crucial for masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and supplies for ventilators, and laboratory materials. This is a good time to look at a core list of medications and ensure that the safest and most effective ones are available. For example, in another area where my group works globally, we've discovered that instead of 30 or 50 medications for high blood pressure, three would do for nearly all patients. Let's make sure we have life-saving medicines and worry less about which companies are making them.  Learn intensively. If there is one key lesson from past epidemics, it's that getting real-time data is essential for a great epidemic response.  Most urgently, we must learn how best to protect health care workers from infection.  from infection. We need to know who is most at risk for spreading the infection , and at what point in their illness -- so that we can target contact tracing most effectively. This will help determine how wide a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test.  , and at what point in their illness -- so that we can target contact tracing most effectively. This will help determine how wide a circle of contacts to track, and how and how often to test. Who is at the highest risk for severe illness and death .  . What works to reduce infection? What public health advice is being followed, and what is the impact? Some countries require that all patients, even those with mild illness, are isolated in facilities. (This could be done, for example, in college dormitories). Is this necessary and effective? Should it be extended to close contacts to prevent them from spreading the infection? The answer to these questions will depend in part on answers to other questions, such as how often people who never have symptoms, or people who are just beginning to get sick, spread infection.

Are there rapid point-of-care tests and how accurate and timely are blood tests for coronavirus infection?  and how accurate and timely are blood tests for coronavirus infection? Is immunity protective? Even if antibodies are reliably produced, this doesn't necessarily mean that recovered patients are immune from a future infection.  For these questions, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health departments, as well as public health agencies around the world, are crucial. They are the intelligence officers needed to guide our strategy and tactics, and they need to be both at the table when decisions are made and at the podium when policies are explained.  And these are just the epidemiological questions. We also urgently need to know whether treatments work. The preliminary report on the value of chloroquine and azithromycin needs to be rigorously addressed. The disappointing finding that two anti-viral medications didn't improve survival in severely ill patients is a sobering reminder that until there are rigorous studies, we won't know how best to treat patients. Even if we can't dramatically improve outcomes, a treatment that reduces the need for intubation could save many lives.  A safe and effective vaccine is of greatest importance. The world must do everything possible to develop a vaccine, while also recognizing that this may or may not be possible.  Adapt to a new normal. The Covid-19 pandemic will change our world forever. Until it is controlled, we will all need to change how we wash our hands, cover our coughs, greet others and how close we come to others. We will rethink the need for meetings and conferences. We will need broadband for all as a public utility like mail or water. We will need to support the vulnerable, even if only because their illness can risk our health.  Our strategy to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 will necessarily evolve as we learn more about the virus and the effectiveness of different interventions.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  In a fourth phase, a vaccine, if one can be found, or global elimination efforts, if they can succeed, would either end the pandemic or, if not, force us to adapt to the continuing threat for the indefinite future. We face weeks and months of fear and tragedy. Leaders at every level must be frank that this is frightening, unprecedented and irrevocably changes how we provide care and prepare for the future. But it is also a time to recognize that we are all in this together -- not only all in the United States, but all of us globally. Spread anywhere in the world increases risk everywhere. We have a common enemy, and, working together with a common strategy, we can build a new normal that minimizes risk, maximizes collaboration and commits to shared progress.
2020-03-20	(CNN) With social distancing protocols in place as the coronavirus sweeps the nation , people all around the country are stuck inside their homes and getting restless.  It's an antidote to both the boredom brought on by coronavirus-induced social isolation and the absence of human connection that people are currently feeling.  "[People are] lonely, they're looking for connection, they're looking for community, and most importantly, they're looking for love," Lam, 27, told CNN.  "That doesn't stop during a pandemic. People still want love, and we're going to try our best to make that happen."  How it works  "Love Is Quarantine" is "Love Is Blind" for the social distancing era.  For the uninitiated, the hit Netflix series, hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, places male and female contestants in "pods" where they can talk to each other -- but not see each other. Only when the couples decide they want to get married can they reveal themselves and find out what the other looks like.  Participants on "Love Is Quarantine" are placed in virtual pods on Google Sheets.  In "Love Is Quarantine," potential contestants sign up through Google Sheets, providing their first name, age, sex, sexuality, city and phone number. (The project, unlike the show it's inspired by, is LGBTQ+ friendly.) Nix goes down the list and reaches out to people, confirming whether they'd like to participate and moving on if he doesn't hear back almost immediately. If the person responds and is down, Lam puts them in one of the 12 "pandemic pods."  Both Lam and Nix, a.k.a. "obviously" Nick and Vanessa Lachey, then introduce the couple via a text conversation. They offer up a few conversation starters, like where the person is from, how they found out about the project and their ideal date after social distancing is finally over. Then, the two strangers are free to go on their "date," which typically takes the form of a phone conversation.  "In 2020, I think texting is the predominant form of communication and we want to get back to the grassroots and treat it just like the show 'Love is Blind,'" Nix, 28, said. "Because essentially, people are in the pods. The pods are in your apartment, and we want people to communicate and test that vibe over the phone."  The contestants are asked to film themselves before the date, while they're on the date and after the date, describing what they think about the other person -- much like the drama-laden, confessional style of "Love Is Blind."  Lam and Nix then record those clips being played back on a monitor and upload them to the "Love Is Quarantine" Instagram page. So as not to spoil the surprise, they cover up the contestant's face in the shot with their hand -- sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Often, Lam and Nix interject with their own commentary.  It's raw, unfiltered and refreshing.  If the couple hits it off, Lam and Nix reveal their faces on the "Love Is Quarantine" Instagram page and the two are free to keep talking and see where things go.  And if they don't, there's always the next person.  How it started  "Love is Quarantine" is not even a week in, but it's quickly taking off.  Lam proposed the idea to Nix on Tuesday around 5 p.m., he said.  Lam, who produces content for food and beverage startups, and Nix, an actor and real estate agent, both have jobs that have since come to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic. And as self-proclaimed "extreme extroverts" in self-isolation, they couldn't sit still.  The "Love Is Quarantine" Instagram page is where the drama and action gets posted.  About an hour after the idea was born, "Season 1" was already in motion, with participants soon in their "pods" and chatting away on the phone.  After 12 hours, Lam said the Google spreadsheet was flooded with about 300 people, from places as far as Australia and South Korea.  As of this writing, the Instagram page has more than 8,600 followers and counting.  And already, fan favorites have emerged.  Brooke and Red, two people who clicked on Tuesday night, have since earned the couple hashtag #Bred. Steve and Katie, a couple who supposedly "talked all night," has been dubbed "Skatie."  There's also a fan gossip tab on the Google spreadsheet and another to submit "Questions for the Lacheys," meaning Lam and Nix. The dating action continued with "Season 2" on Wednesday night and the two said they plan to keep it going for as long as they can.  Lam and Nix said they had a feeling their project would go viral, and they wanted to pay it forward. They said they're partnering with others to create "Love Is Quarantine" merch -- all the proceeds of which will go to Feeding America , a nonprofit organization that has been providing food to people through the uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus outbreak.  "We're doing all right," Lam said of him and Nix. "And there's a lot of people out there that aren't doing so good. So we hope that this is more than a just funny, entertainment thing, that we can actually help real people."  Meanwhile, they're also making bigger plans for the "Love Is Quarantine" couples who experience a spark.  On the Netflix show "Love Is Blind," the couples who make it out of the pods are flown to a resort in Mexico, where they spend the "honeymoon" period of their engagement getting to know each other in person.  On "Love Is Quarantine," Lam said, couples will spend their honeymoon period at Popeye's.  After the coronavirus lockdowns end, of course.
2020-03-20	Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch  Famed hedge fund Bridgewater predicts the coronavirus will lead to $4 trillion in lost corporate revenue for both public and private businesses in the U.S., according to a report the firm published Friday.  “That is a very dangerous decline, and if not mitigated, it will lead to a long-lasting ripple,” said the Bridgewater team who authored the research report.  In Bridgewater’s model, companies will have a shortfall of $2 trillion “concentrated in energy and travel and leisure, and about equally divided between large and small companies.”  The firm projects a 6% decline in US GDP for 2020, with the biggest hit during the second quarter.  The firm also estimates a decline of $12 trillion for global businesses in 2020.  “Since this hit to revenues is happening throughout the world, the total hole globally will be roughly three times that—about $12 trillion. Governments are responding, of course, but in most cases these responses will just mitigate some of the ripple. Governments’ capacities to deal with this hit vary greatly and will be a major driver of markets going forward.”  “Many companies will try to fill this gap by drawing credit lines, increasing their debt positions,” said the investors.  If government policies don’t help fill the gap, companies are likely to dramatically cut spending, which would result in meaningful cuts in employment.  Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater, is famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis.
2020-03-21	London (CNN Business) Monday, February 17. The novel coronavirus outbreak is raging in China, but fewer than 1,000 people have been infected outside the country. With the virus out of sight and mostly out of mind, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stands just shy of 30,000 points, driven by the longest US economic expansion in history.  What investors couldn't know is that over the next 30 days, the coronavirus would burst out of quarantine in China, with major outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, then Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis.  A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression. More bad news: The coronavirus outbreak may just be getting started.  Central banks and governments are now unleashing a tsunami of interest rate cuts, loan guarantees and new spending, tapping emergency powers to reassure investors, cushion the shock to companies and workers and preserve the foundations of a functioning economy for the future.  In the United States, the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a rescue bill that would inject $1 trillion into the economy to prevent mass layoffs as huge swaths of the world's biggest economy shut down and airlines, hotels and restaurants run out of cash. In an extraordinary move, the UK government on Friday said it would pay 80% of the wages of anyone at risk of losing their job because of the pandemic.  Yet the rescue efforts may already be too late. Goldman Sachs estimates that 2.25 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits this week — that would be the biggest number on record. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases marches higher. The global number of infections has topped 270,000, and more than 11,000 people have been killed worldwide. Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom are under partial or complete lockdowns. California, which boasts the world's fifth largest economy, has directed 40 million people to stay at home  "The coronavirus has created unprecedented financial and societal disruption," David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said this week.  Most exposed to the fallout are businesses and workers in transport, the energy industry and hospitality as international aviation shuts down, oil consumption collapses and pubs, bars and restaurants are ordered to close.  "In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed," Moody's Investor Services said in a note on Friday.  While the pandemic is still unfolding, economists are already thinking about how it will change the world. Many expect significant shifts in how supply chains are constructed and how global trade is conducted. The merits of capitalism, democratic systems of government and globalization are likely to come under intense scrutiny.  A warning from Apple  February 17 was a holiday in the United States and stock markets were closed. But on that Monday, Apple sounded the alarm. It warned that it wouldn't meet its revenue projections for the first three months of the year because the coronavirus had reduced iPhone manufacturing capacity in China, and with Chinese stores closed or operating reduced hours, demand for the company's products was also dropping. When US markets reopened on February 18, investors pushed the company's stock down by 2.6%.  The initial hit to its stock may have been modest, but Apple was the first major US company to warn that the coronavirus was affecting its business in a big way. What's more, Apple laid out exactly why the epidemic was such a big threat: the reaction to the outbreak was hammering both supply and demand.  That dual threat is exactly why pandemics can be much more damaging than many other "black swan" events. People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and services, as well as energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production.  "A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact," the World Bank said in a report from 2013.  Apple's AAPL In the month followingwarning, thousands more companies came under huge pressure. Carmakers, which rely on global supply chains and timely deliveries to keep their plants open, shuttered factories in Europe and then the United States. Airlines canceled international flights to China, and then just about everywhere else. CAPA Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, says most carriers will be bankrupt by the end of May unless governments bail them out.  Cathay Pacific planes are seen parked on the tarmac in Hong Kong.  Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the nature of the pandemic will encourage companies to begin reviewing the costs of global economic integration. "The free flow of goods, capital, and people has generated enormous benefits but also created channels for rapid worldwide contagion from financial shocks, geopolitical conflicts, and epidemics," he said.  The debate over how companies and governments should respond is already underway, with some observers arguing that countries must make more essential products including medical supplies at home in order to prevent shortages, an impulse that could accelerate a rollback of globalization exemplified by the trade war between the United States and China.  But William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the pandemic can't undo the technological advances that have dramatically boosted global trade over the past 50 years. "The larger question is whether those tools will be used in the same way and to the same degree as they have been," he said. One change that Reinsch sees coming is how executives think about the supplies they need. "The coronavirus crisis has taught them that supply chains are a lot more fragile than they thought, that supplies can be suddenly interrupted for unexpected reasons, and that a prudent manager will not only have a Plan B, but a Plan C and Plan D as well," he said.  Policymakers respond as markets crash  Starting on February 18, US stocks entered a stunning freefall that wiped away roughly a third of their value and ended the longest bull market in history. The Dow has fallen nearly 35% since Apple issued its coronavirus warning, posting shock declines on March 9 (-7.8%), March 12 (-10%) and March 16 (-12.9%). The index closed at 19,174 points on Friday.  Markets in Europe and Asia have also plunged. Europe's Stoxx 600 has lost roughly a third of its value since February 18, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has dropped 18% over the same time period. According to Bank of America, $27 trillion has been wiped off global stocks since the end of January.  United Airlines UAL Renault RNLSY Marriott International's MAR Companies exposed to fallout from the pandemic have seen their stocks decimated. Shares inare down roughly 70% so far this year, while French carmakerhas plummeted 62%.stock is down 50% over the same period. Share prices may come under even more pressure.  According to Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, the ability of central banks to put a floor under stock markets is limited. "History suggests that equity markets are only likely to bottom out when it becomes clear that the flow of new cases of the virus has peaked. Until this happens, we should expect stock markets to remain under pressure," he said.  US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives a press briefing after the surprise rate cut on March 3.  Central banks have responded to the mounting economic devastation by slashing interest rates and using other tools in their arsenal to support growth and prevent financial markets from seizing up. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates at emergency meetings on March 3 and March 15, reducing them to a record low near zero while committing $750 billion to buy government bonds and other securities.  The Bank of England has also cut interest rates twice, on March 11 and March 19. In Japan and Europe, where interest rates have been in negative territory for years, central banks have joined the Fed in announcing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of asset purchases.  Governments have promised to inject huge sums into the economy. Morgan Stanley says spending commitments from the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and China add up to at least $1.7 trillion. And a much larger sum has been promised in the form of credit guarantees.  "While the initial response from developed economies was slow, over the last few days — as economic and financial market disruptions persist — we have started to see strong commitments from policy makers, indicating a sizable fiscal expansion plan is in the offing," Morgan Stanley chief economist Chetan Ahya told clients on Thursday.  What happens next  Goldman Sachs warned Friday that US GDP could plummet at an annual rate of 24% during the second quarter, with unemployment peaking around 9% later this year. The bank said that reports suggest a "sudden surge in layoffs and a collapse in spending, both historic in size and speed."  The economic collapse predicted by Goldman would be significantly worse than the sharpest contraction during the Great Recession, when GDP dropped by a rate of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. It would also surpass the previous post-World-War-II record of 10% set in early 1958.  Recently assembled vehicles made by Peugeot owner PSA Group, which has closed plants due to coronavirus.  The picture is much the same in other countries where businesses are shutting down because of the coronavirus. According to Deutsche Bank, if the pandemic affects the United Kingdom for longer than expected, its economy could shrink 6% this year as the country plunges into the worst recession in a century.  Kevin Hassett, an economist and former CNN contributor who is returning to the Trump administration to help the coronavirus response, said this week that the pandemic could spark a repeat of the Great Depression that began in 1929 and lasted for years.  "We're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that's risky," he said. "Because at some point, we can't not have an economy, right?"  — Julia Horowitz and Matt Egan contributed reporting.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) As people everywhere struggle to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus -- a pandemic that feels very much like the starting point of a new era -- another contest is unfolding over which political system is better suited to tackle the problem, and which will emerge victorious in its aftermath.  Does the pandemic prove that authoritarianism is better? Can democracy handle the challenge? The questions lie at the heart of a messaging campaign quietly flooding the world, a concerted effort to portray democracy as an inferior system.  The propaganda battle is emanating from China, where the ruling regime appears determined to leverage the pandemic to defend and promote its system of government and raise its global standing when the crisis is over.  An abundance of international media coverage about the troubles with the United States' response has boosted Beijing's propaganda effort. There is no question the US has made many grievous errors, something China's government-controlled media discusses at great length, never mind that Chinese journalists mysteriously disappeared when trying to report on it independently in their own country.  With thinly concealed glee, China's official publications enumerate the failings not only of the US coronavirus control efforts but of the American system of government, arguing that racism inequality and political divisions in America inevitably have hampered the response.  "The truth is," Beijing's Global Times asserted, the "US system is not nearly as efficient as the Chinese system."  They also take the opportunity to disparage Western criticism of China's horrifying human rights record.  Boosting its campaign, China has been shipping planeloads of aid to affected countries, widely publicizing the effort and seeking to emerge as the great, efficient and magnanimous superpower as it tries to strengthen ties with US allies, whose relations with Washington have grown strained under the current administration.  So far, with the democratic West consumed with fighting Covid-19, Beijing has had the field mostly to itself, making strides with its fabricated narrative that China is simply on a different, higher level when it comes to epidemic control.  But are dictatorships by nature better at dealing with pandemics?  The answer is simply no. While it is true that autocracies have an easier time imposing draconian measures on large populations, it is also undeniable that open societies are better at preventing the emergence of pandemics.  By covering up the magnitude of the outbreak in Wuhan early on, China's repressive practices , in fact, allowed a novel coronavirus to take root in a city, and then a province, and ultimately to spread so fast that it now infects almost every country on Earth. As has been thoroughly documented, Chinese scientists who raised the alarm about the new pathogen infecting patients in Wuhan were detained, harassed and silenced.  Laboratories that identified the virus were ordered to "stop tests, destroy samples, and suppress the news," according to independent Chinese media. The news to the public was supposed to be good; anything that might hurt the regime and its image was unacceptable. When Dr. Li Wenliang tried to spread the word, he was detained for spreading rumors. He died of Covid-19 last month.  It's no coincidence that some of the gravest mistakes in the US response were precisely the result of authoritarian instincts at play, efforts to suppress the truth and manipulate the message. When President Donald Trump spent months telling Americans that there was nothing to worry about, he arguably allowed the virus to spread more freely in the population, making the crisis worse. The epidemiologist who helped end smallpox, Larry Brilliant, called Trump's lies, "the most irresponsible act of an elected official that I've ever witnessed in my lifetime."  Does that mean democracies are incapable of preventing pandemics? Of course not. It means democracies need to elect competent, trustworthy leaders.  That is not to deny that once a pandemic does spread, tyrants have an easier hand imposing strict measures. Once China acknowledged the crisis, it launched a heavy-handed campaign to isolate and restrict movement, with some residents forced into quarantine centers and reports of coercive practices by authorities.  The method appears to have worked. New infections there, for the moment, have slowed to a trickle , according to Beijing.  But democracies have also succeeded. Countries like South Korea and Taiwan have also brought the number of cases sharply down with world-class epidemic control practices, without harsh violations of human liberties, or even a sharp reduction in economic activity.  As the contagion spreads, imposing restrictions on civil liberties creates wrenching dilemmas for open societies. That's a dilemma that dictatorships don't face.  Balancing the public good and individual liberties is a constant struggle for democratic societies. During a pandemic, the public good weighs much more heavily. Pandemics also demand a more active role for authorities, for the government. In autocracies, that only helps despots tighten their grip. In democracies, that creates friction, anxiety and push-back to protect freedom and democracy.  A case in point is Israel, whose government was one of the first to impose measures that have now become commonplace around the world, banning travel to countries with high infection rates and quarantining foreign visitors, for example. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insists he's acting only to safeguard the public, is being accused of using the crisis to protect himself from his massive legal troubles and in the process putting Israel's democracy at risk.  Democracies have the challenge of protecting their values while fighting the pandemic. They try to rely on a bottom-up approach to social restrictions, hoping that the public will respond because it understands the risk, not because sinister enforcers will give them no other choice.  That's why public officials must explain the facts, plainly and clearly, without sugarcoating or sending mixed messages so that the public will trust them and heed the advice of experts. Otherwise, the system won't work. Otherwise, restrictions will require coercion, as they do in dictatorships.  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

2020-03-21	Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week his country managed to stop the mass spread of coronavirus -- and that the situation was "under control," thanks to early and aggressive measures to keep more people from getting the disease .  Does Russia have coronavirus under control? According to information released by Russian officials, Putin's strategy seems to have worked. The number of confirmed Russian coronavirus cases is surprisingly low, despite Russia sharing a lengthy border with China and recording its first case back in January.  The numbers are picking up, but Russia -- a country of 146 million people -- has fewer confirmed cases than Luxembourg, with just 253 people infected. Luxembourg, by contrast, has a population of just 628,000, according to the CIA World Factbook , and by Saturday had reported 670 coronavirus cases with eight deaths.  Russia's early response measures -- such as shutting down its 2,600-mile border with China as early as January 30, and setting up quarantine zones -- may have contributed to the delay of a full-blown outbreak, some experts say.  A strong record on testing  "The director-general of WHO said 'test, test, test,'" Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, told CNN Thursday. "Well, Russia started that literally at the end of January."  Vujnovic said Russia also took a broader set of measures in addition to testing.  "Testing and identification of cases, tracing contacts, isolation, these are all measures that WHO proposes and recommends, and they were in place all the time," she said. "And the social distancing is the second component that really also started relatively early."  Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's state consumer watchdog, said Saturday that it had run more than 156,000 coronavirus tests in total. By comparison, according to CDC figures , the United States only picked up the pace in testing at the beginning of March, while Russia says it has been testing en masse since early February, including in airports, focusing on travelers from Iran, China, and South Korea.  That's not to say there were no holes in Russia's defenses. Russia didn't start testing those arriving from Italy or other badly affected EU countries immediately, limiting its controls for arrivals from Europe to taking temperatures and imposing two-week quarantines. The majority of the coronavirus cases reported in Russia were brought from Italy, according to health officials  Distrust among the population  People have still been crowding the Moscow metro system.  Still, Russia contends with widespread public skepticism, a legacy of its Soviet past. On social media, Russians have raised questions referring to their country's poor track record of transparency, such as the coverup around the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe in 1986 and the country's botched response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.  Authorities have moved swiftly to counter what they see as misinformation. In early March, Russia's Federal Security Service and internet watchdog moved to take down a viral post claiming the real number of coronavirus cases was 20,000 and that the Russian government was covering it up. Facebook and Instagram users in Russia then started to see coronavirus awareness alerts linking to Rospotrebnadzor's official website.  News reports of shortages in protective equipment have also fueled skepticism. And some experts have raised doubts about the reliability of Russia's testing system, which depends on a single laboratory. A report by PCR.News, a media outlet for medics and healthcare professionals, pointed out that the only approved coronavirus testing system, produced by Vector in Novosibirsk, has a lower sensitivity than other virus tests, raising concerns about false negatives.  David Berov, the first confirmed coronavirus patient in Moscow, wrote on Instagram that his second test showed a negative result, while the first and third tested positive for coronavirus.  "The virus was confirmed in my third test, it was not seen in my blood but was in my saliva," Berov wrote on March 5. "As I was told, they could barely see it so that's why they were in doubt for so long."  Vector did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian branch of the WHO, however, told CNN it received the specifications for the Vector test kits and the laboratory had been placed on the list of approved institutions used to confirm the coronavirus.  Cover-up allegations rebutted by Kremlin and the WHO  Putin has put together a coronavirus information center in Moscow, pictured here.  Anastasia Vasilyeva, a doctor for Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny and leader of the Alliance of Doctors union, made headlines with a series of videos in which she claims the authorities are covering up real coronavirus numbers by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis.  "You see they said the first coronavirus patient that died, that the cause of death was thrombosis," Vasilyeva told CNN. "That's obvious, nobody dies from coronavirus itself, they die from the complications, so it's very easy to manipulate this."  Moscow health officials denied the accusation and said they were testing pneumonia patients for coronavirus. The WHO's Dr. Vujnovic also was skeptical about Vasilyeva's claim.  "If there was a hidden, unrecognized burden somewhere it would be seen in these [pneumonia] reports," she said. "So I do not believe this is happening, which does not say that you might not see an increase of cases in the next period, because we have seen that in many countries."  Putin himself addressed the concerns about the statistics Wednesday, saying the government might not have the full picture but is not covering up the numbers.  "Here is the thing: the authorities may not possess the full information, because people a) sometimes do not report it, b) they themselves don't know that they are sick, and the latent period is very long," he said in a televised meeting. "But everything that is issued ... by the Ministry of Health is all objective information."  This week the numbers have surged, with Russia adding 30 to 50 cases every day, and the count will most likely continue its upward trajectory as Russia expands its testing. Nevertheless, the local representative for the WHO says Russia is still doing relatively well, as the country tracks cases with epidemiological links to travel or family transmission. On Saturday morning, Rospotrebnadzor released a figure potentially more concerning than the number of confirmed cases -- 36,540 people are being monitored for possible coronavirus.  Meanwhile, the government moved to impose more sweeping measures, canceling public events and closing Russia's borders to foreigners, with some exceptions. But politics as usual continues under Putin: the President has signed a decree scheduling a nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments that could see him stay in power till 2036 on April 22. The authorities have vowed to monitor coronavirus developments but so far have not changed the date.
2020-03-21	(CNN) As the US has lagged behind other advanced nations in testing for the coronavirus , former government officials and public health experts point to a series of policy and procedural decisions that they say hindered the nation's response to the pandemic.  South Korea had run more than 300,000 tests as of Friday, and while there is no official count of tests done in the United States, Dr. Deborah Birx , part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, implied about 170,000 people have been tested so far. The US population is more than six times that of South Korea.  For weeks public and private labs have raced to boost their testing capacity, but people across the country, even some with underlying health conditions, have told CNN this week that they have not been able to get tested.  Asked Friday whether the US can currently meet demand for tests, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, "We are not there yet."  The CDC's first test didn't work  In January, shortly after Chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus as the cause of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, the World Health Organization published a protocol with instructions for any country to manufacture tests for the virus.  Rather than using that protocol, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed its own test. A WHO spokesperson said this week that the WHO didn't offer tests to the CDC because the US agency typically has the capacity to manufacture them itself.  On February 5, the CDC said it would begin shipping test kits to health labs throughout the country, but in subsequent days public labs found a defect. When public labs first receive any test kit, they first verify that it works.  "It gave them an inconclusive result, so the test was not valid," said Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  A CDC official said on February 12 a part of the test needed to be remanufactured.  JUST WATCHED Doctor: For the first time in my career I'm afraid Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Doctor: For the first time in my career I'm afraid 04:11  It was weeks before new CDC tests were sent out  Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that in addition to originally sending out flawed tests, the CDC added to the confusion by providing limited information to labs in the weeks that followed.  "There was a period of time after the tests were recalled where there was near silence. It was about two weeks. And this caused confusion among labs about what, if anything, hospital laboratories could do," Mina said. "While we are on the correct trajectory now, we are unfortunately weeks behind where we should be as a country."  Jeremy Konyndyk, an expert on global pandemic preparedness, agreed that significant delays resulted from the CDC sticking with only its test.  "The whole diagnostic capability of the United States against this disease was hung up on one test being produced at CDC," said Konyndyk, formerly a director with the US Agency for International Development and now with the Center for Global Development. "And when that test failed, all of the testing outside of it, outside of what CDC itself could do and its own lab, was held up. That kept us from having visibility on domestic transmission of the virus for weeks and weeks and weeks."  Fauci has said the CDC has for years followed a process of developing its own test and providing that to public health departments throughout the country.  Though when asked during CNN's coronavirus town hall last week whether the US should have used the WHO tests, Fauci said, "If you look back and Monday morning quarterback it would have been nice to have had a backup."  Red tape kept labs from using their own tests  The US Food and Drug Administration also received criticism in February as the tally of cases climbed globally.  JUST WATCHED Doctor's message to those not taking coronavirus seriously Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Doctor's message to those not taking coronavirus seriously 00:50  More than 100 virologists and other specialists wrote a letter to Congress on February 28 that said many of their labs had already validated tests for coronavirus that they could not run due to the FDA's protocol for approving tests during outbreaks -- known as emergency-use authorization.  The letter protested the FDA's regulatory process as "significantly more stringent than that required for every other virus we test for." The letter said the result was "undue pressure on the CDC and state public health labs to rapidly scale manufacturing and clinical testing."  On February 29, FDA issued new guidance that allowed certain US labs to test for coronavirus using diagnostics the labs developed and validated, before the agency reviewed them.  Dr. Alex Greninger, an assistant professor at the University of Washington's Department of Laboratory Medicine and one of the letter's signatories, said the emergency-use authorization process in place in February would have taken weeks for clinical labs and others to clear.  "You have to give credit to the FDA, they have changed their policies significantly," said Greninger, who added that the transmissibility of the coronavirus seemed to defy regulations previously established by the government. "How do you regulate something you've never seen before?"  In a statement, the FDA said laboratories have had the ability to develop their own tests from day one and that the FDA's independent check is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of tests.  On why it issued new guidance, the FDA said that "under the current circumstances, which are unlike any prior emergency we have seen, we think the benefit of access to certain tests outweigh the risks associated with launching tests prior to FDA review."

MUST WATCH Tapper rips Trump: At least stop making things worse 02:12  Severe shortages of swabs and other supplies  Even though commercial labs ramped up the testing, medical workers at several state health departments, hospitals and labs told CNN that they're running low on materials needed to conduct the tests, like swabs, reagents, which are the testing chemicals, and pipettes, which are tools for transporting liquids. The shortage forced Minnesota and Ohio to limit testing to the most vulnerable patients.  "I'm really concerned that we are not going to have the capabilities to test those who really need and should get a test," said Becker of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  The FDA said earlier this week it is well aware of the shortages and is providing information "on alternative sources of reagents, extraction kits, swabs and more."  The Trump administration restructured the pandemic unit  Some former officials from President Barack Obama's administration have argued the Trump White House undercut its ability to respond to the coronavirus by restructuring in 2018 a team that dealt with pandemics, known as the National Security Council's Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense.  "Would we have gotten more ahead of this if the office had still been intact? I think absolutely," said Beth Cameron, the former senior director for that NSC team, who is now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative.  John Bolton, then Trump's national security adviser, tweeted Saturday that such claims "are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority."  Last week, Trump declined to take responsibility for the NSC changes when a reporter asked him about the issue. "I didn't do it," he said.  The White House has said the NSC's global health directorate was absorbed into another directorate with similar responsibilities but different titles.  Others have defended the speed with which the government and industry have moved to increase testing capacity.  Test supplier Roche Diagnostics Corp., which says it is now distributing 400,000 tests per week to labs in the United States, said in a statement that test development usually takes about 18 months in addition to the FDA's review time. A company spokesperson said Roche developed a coronavirus test and was issued an emergency-use authorization in about six weeks.  Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, said the administration has in recent weeks cut red tape and bureaucracy to expand test capacity while upholding a quality of tests superior to those used in some other countries.

MUST WATCH Congressman with virus: I feel as sick as I've ever been 02:00  "Over the next few months, you will begin to see that other tests that were utilized around the world were not of the same quality, resulting in false positives and potentially false negatives," Birx said Tuesday.  "It doesn't help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives," she added.  The New York Times reported Tuesday that Birx later clarified that she was referring to a study of an early coronavirus test used in China. That study found that nearly half of asymptomatic people in China could test positive for Covid-19 without being actually infected.  Asked earlier this week how he would rate his administration's response to the virus on a scale of 1 to 10, Trump said, "I'd rate it a 10."  "We're doing something that's never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well," he said.

He holds a BA in Government and Women's and Gender Studies modified with Geography from Dartmouth College and an MSc in Real Estate from the University of Hong Kong. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  Fox News personality Jesse Watters asked China for a formal apology earlier this month during "The Five," a Fox News panel talk show he co-hosts. According to Watters, the virus originated from Chinese people eating raw bats and snakes because "the Chinese communist government cannot feed the people, and they are desperate."  Watters also said scientists believe this to be the origin of the virus, despite no credible disease expert having made any statement of the sort. Scientists do believe the virus likely originated in an animal before transmission to a human host, but the exact sequence of events or even the animal in question remains unknown.  Watters has not responded to the global backlash against his comments, though he did say recently on his show, as infections in the US continue to spiral, that he has started to take social distancing more seriously.  In a seemingly retaliatory move , a Chinese government spokesman took to Twitter to suggest an unfounded claim that it may have been the "US army [that] brought the epidemic to Wuhan" instead. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, republished a one-minute clip of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a US congressional hearing on the virus. In the clip, Redfield can be heard admitting to cases of deaths in the US from the coronavirus that were previously misattributed to influenza.  Despite this having nothing to do with the US army and their visit to Wuhan for the Military World Games in October 2019, Zhao is seemingly using the evidence of misdiagnosis and a lack of transparency as ammunition to fire back at the US.  As the whole world now scrambles to deal with an escalating threat that just a month ago seemed to be a "Chinese problem," it is time to acknowledge that blame is hardly the point and most definitely not the solution.  In fact, the deep-seated Sinophobia, or anti-Chinese bias, underlying the initial urge to judge China for the problem is what has allowed Covid-19 to catch the US off guard with its widely criticized response to the pandemic.  As China has grown economically and politically to a position of global influence since the late 1990s, it has received backlash and criticism, particularly from its neighbors in Asia Pacific and in Western Europe and the United States. Many questions that have been raised regarding human rights violations are valid, but some, including Watters' comments that intend to paint China as an underdeveloped, backwards country, are more self-serving than anything else.  By vilifying China, critics like Watters perpetuate a narrative of Western supremacy. This narrative is so pervasive that despite reports that China is now home to more of the world's wealthiest people than the US, some people still believe that everyone in China lives in extreme poverty.  The misconception of what it means to be Chinese or live in China has cultivated a widespread negative sentiment towards the Chinese people, leading to a rise in hate crimes against people of Chinese or Asian descent. Such negative sentiment informs not only how we treat Chinese or Asians in general whom we encounter but also how quickly we are to accept any criticism of the Chinese government or Chinese officials without much substantiation.  Without dwelling too much on substantiating what should be a well-known fact, it is easy to point to universities like Tsinghua, the wide adoption of mobile payment and apps, and the massive footprint of luxury brands in China to debunk all the aforementioned depictions of the Asian country and its people.  The virus was thus not born in a setting of extreme poverty and filth but rather somewhere much more like home. Hence, Covid-19 is now trending worldwide.  Trump's choice of words is intended to "other" the virus, a strategy that he has used in the past to characterize other threats to America and the American way of life. The President claims that his choice of words is "not racist at all." With so many cases in the US, Trump's central focus on the origin of the virus cannot be more irrelevant now.  Similarly, many foreigners, even some of the expats I work with in Hong Kong who have visited China, cling to the misconception that Chinese people must be the source of the spread of the virus anywhere.  For instance, in Italy, which is now on lockdown as it struggles to contain, at the time of writing, nearly 55,000 cases of the coronavirus, the Tuscan city of Prato is home to the highest concentration of Chinese migrants in the country. On more than one occasion, people I have engaged in casual conversations with about the coronavirus have tried to point to the town as the source of the virus in Italy.  However, by early March, two weeks into Italy's initial lockdown of the original "red zones" -- so named for their high level of infections -- there were no reported cases of the coronavirus in Prato , the city or the larger province of which it is the capital.  In Hong Kong, there have been widespread calls for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to shut all border crossings with China since January. Lam has refused.

Due to its incubation period, which may be as long as 14 days, everyone we see, including healthy-looking, non-Chinese people, could be a carrier.  As the global fight against an unprecedented virus drags on, we should be open-minded and accept that good disease-combating measures can come from anywhere, including China. It truly would be a shame if more people had to die because of some age-old prejudice.
2020-03-22	Speaking to lawmakers on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the 2020 Summer Olympics is a possibility.  This is the first time Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start July 24 as scheduled.  In recent days, a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the games to be postponed, while Canada said today it will not send any teams.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) responded Sunday, saying a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks, due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics.

Empty stores and restaurants. Canceled birthday parties, weddings and graduation ceremonies. Hospitals bracing for a wave of patients needing care. At moments this week, it felt like we were living in a sci-fi novel -- and not a hopeful one.  But this wasn't Stephen King. It was reality in America — "social distancing" to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus. And it may take weeks before we know how well it works.  King wrote a chilling fantasy about life in a post-pandemic world back in 1978, "The Stand." Earlier this month, he commented, reassuringly, on Twitter : "No, coronavirus is NOT like THE STAND. It's not anywhere near as serious. It's eminently survivable. Keep calm and take all reasonable precautions."  Still, the door-stopper of a book contains some wisdom that could guide us. One of its characters reflects, "Love didn't grow very well in a place where there was only fear, just as plants didn't grow very well in a place where it was always dark."

"Viruses clearly don't care whether we are rich or poor, white or black, gun owners or radical pacifists," she wrote. "We share common breath... There is really no elsewhere, no place to retreat, no gated community whose walls will serve: We are all linked, and our health is a community function -- the well-being of others is also the well-being of ourselves ."  Annika Olson pleaded with her peers: "Sure, many of us can shake off the disease. But millions of people cannot, and we are putting their lives at risk.

2020-03-22	New York (CNN Business) Emirates Group is temporarily suspending most passenger flights — maintaining just its cargo operations — because of coronavirus .  The Dubai-based airline plans to halt most passenger services as of March 25, it said in a statement Sunday. After initially saying it would suspend all passenger flights, the company amended its statement later Sunday to say it will continue operating passenger flights to 13 destinations in response to "requests from governments."  Emirates is also taking a number of other cost-cutting measures, including reducing operations at its air services division, Dnata, and a temporary cut to most employees' basic salaries.  The announcement comes as airlines around the world grapple with a massive loss of business as demand for air travel dries up amid the coronavirus outbreak. Around the world, coronavirus cases have topped 300,000, nearly 13,000 people have died and many countries and local jurisdictions have implemented travel restrictions to stop the spread.  US airlines say they have seen a "virtual shutdown" in air domestic travel, and some wonder if federal officials will ground many or all domestic flights. The US airline industry is seeking about $50 billion in federal help to deal with the crisis.  "The world has literally gone into quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak," Emirates Group chairman and CEO HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in the statement.  "As a global network airline, we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot viably operate passenger services until countries re-open their borders, and travel confidence returns. By Wednesday 25 March, although we will still operate cargo flights which remain busy, Emirates will have temporarily suspended most of its passenger operations," he said.  Emirates will continue to operate its international air cargo network to transport "essential goods including medical supplies" around the world.  Passenger flights will continue to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Canada "until further notice, as long as borders remain open," Emirates said in its updated statement Sunday.  The company said it is taking steps to protect the health of employees who have to continue coming to work, including enhanced cleaning at its facilities and on its planes, temperature screening at office entry points and providing hand sanitizers and masks to some frontline employees.  In order to further manage costs, the President of Emirates Tim Clark and President of Dnata Gary Chapman plan to take a 100% basic salary cut for three months.  Emirates also plans to cut most employees' basic salaries by 25% to 50% for three months, in what the company said is a move to avoid having to lay off staff. Employees will still receive "other allowances" during this time, and junior level employees will be exempt from the salary reduction.  "Rather than ask employees to leave the business, we chose to implement a temporary basic salary cut as we want to protect our workforce and keep our talented and skilled people, as much as possible," Sheikh Ahmed said. "We want to avoid cutting jobs. When demand picks up again, we also want to be able to quickly ramp up and resume services for our customers."
2020-03-22	London (CNN Business) A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here .  The coronavirus pandemic has quickly thrust the world into recession as bars and restaurants shut down and countries instruct their citizens to hunker down. The question now is just how deep the pain will be, and how long it will last.  A picture of the economic devastation in North America and Europe has already started to emerge. A US government report published Thursday showed that 281,000 Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week — a sudden 33% jump over the week before and the largest percentage increase since 1992.  This week is expected to be much worse. Goldman Sachs predicts that a shocking 2.25 million Americans will have filed for their first week of unemployment benefits. That would be eight times the number of people who filed last week and the highest level on record.  Watch this space: The investment bank thinks the US unemployment rate will shoot up from an all-time low of 3.5% to 9% "over the next couple of quarters."  Fears about joblessness on this scale could jolt markets again. Investors have priced in a recession by now, but may still be processing the size of the hole the coronavirus has blown into the global economy, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told me.  "The market is expecting bad data," he said, but the jobs numbers may be "far worse" than investors think.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 35% from its all-time high in mid-February, erasing all its gains since President Donald Trump's inauguration . Between January 20 and last Thursday, $27 trillion was wiped off global stocks, according to Bank of America.  And there's still no nadir in sight, especially as dismal economic data from Europe and North America begins to roll in.  "[The market is] unlikely to bottom until we see the peak in new virus cases, and we just don't know when that will be," Kleintop said. "We don't have anything for the market to hold onto to steady it."  Fearful of devastating layoffs in the travel and hospitality industries, governments are taking radical steps to support businesses. The United Kingdom on Friday pledged to pay 80% of wages, up to £2,500 ($2,895) per month, for employees who can't work because of the pandemic.  That could help: Economists are hopeful that such dramatic measures can ease some of the pain. Capital Economics believes that in the United Kingdom, unemployment will now rise from 4% to 6%, instead of to 8% as had been "previously feared."  "Providing cash-strapped firms with generous subsidies to retain their staff will dramatically lower the risk of surging unemployment during the coronavirus recession," Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, told clients Friday. And it "raises the chance that the economy can get back to normal quickly" once restrictions are lifted, he added.  The 30 days that brought the world to the brink of depression  Monday, February 17. The novel coronavirus outbreak is raging in China, but fewer than 1,000 people have been infected outside the country. With the virus out of sight and mostly out of mind, the Dow stands just shy of 30,000 points, driven by the longest US economic expansion in history.  What investors couldn't know is that over the next 30 days, the coronavirus would burst out of quarantine in China, with major outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, then Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis.  Where we stand: A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion, and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression. And the coronavirus outbreak may just be getting started.  Central banks and governments have unleashed a tsunami of interest rate cuts, loan guarantees and new spending, tapping emergency powers to reassure investors, cushion the shock to companies and workers and preserve the foundations of a functioning economy for the future. Yet the rescue efforts may already be too late.  "In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed," the credit ratings agency Moody's told clients on Friday.

2020-03-23	The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery said symptoms of anosmia, or lack of sense of smell, and dysgeusia, or lack of taste, should be used to identify possible Covid-19 infections.  "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," reads to a statement on the academy's website.  Those symptoms "warrant serious consideration for self-isolation and testing of these individuals," continues the statement.  The academy made its announcement after ENT UK, a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom, said in a separate statement on its website on Saturday that anosmia could be another symptom of infection with the novel coronavirus.
2020-03-23	Hong Kong (CNN) Only a week ago, Hong Kong seemed like a model for how to contain the novel coronavirus , with a relatively small number of cases despite months of being on the front lines of the outbreak .  That was in large part thanks to action taken early on, while cases were spreading across mainland China, to implement measures that are now familiar throughout the world: virus mapping, social distancing, intensive hand-washing, and wearing masks and other protective clothing.  Hong Kong was proof that these measures worked, with the city of 7.5 million only reporting some 150 cases at the start of March, even as the number of infections spiked in other East Asian territories like South Korea and Japan, and spread rapidly across Europe and North America.  Now, however, Hong Kong is providing a very different object lesson -- what happens when you let your guard down too soon. The number of confirmed cases has almost doubled in the past week, with many imported from overseas, as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- return, bringing the virus back with them  On Monday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that all non-residents would be barred from the territory as of Wednesday, the latest addition to a raft of new measures.  This is a pattern playing out across parts of Asia -- mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan -- that were among the first to tackle the outbreak. All are now introducing new restrictions as a sudden wave of renewed cases begins to crest.  Compared to major cities in the West, like London or New York, residents in Hong Kong can sometimes feel as if they're living in the future. Many of the measures enacted in the Asian metropolis back in February are now being rolled out in European and American cities.  But this latest lesson may be a bitter pill to swallow, as it indicates that quarantines and social distancing must continue well beyond the initial wave of cases, if another round of infections is to be avoided.  For those just going into lockdown, that could mean they're in for the long haul.  Office workers and pedestrians wearing protective masks walk along Queen's Road Central in the Central district of Hong Kong on Friday, March 20, 2020.  Waves of infection  On March 2, after several weeks of working from home, the majority of Hong Kong's 180,000 civil servants returned to their offices . Private employers, which have largely been taking their lead from the government, followed suit, and the city's subway system, though never exactly empty, was suddenly flush with people again.  This seemed like a reasonable measure at the time. Even as cases were on the rise in Italy and elsewhere, there were then only 100 confirmed in Hong Kong, and in mainland China the number of new infections was beginning to stabilize.  It was natural therefore that people began to relax somewhat, not only going to work instead of staying home, but also having dinner together, going to the park, and attending weddings and other large social gatherings. While face masks were still common, some people could be spotted going uncovered, particularly for short trips, and there was a general sense of slowly getting back to normal.  In the week that followed the March 2 return to work, there were only five new cases in Hong Kong, most of which were imported. Numbers remained low until around March 16, when dozens of new cases were confirmed. It soon became clear that while the majority were coming from overseas, quarantine measures in place were not sufficient, and local transmission had resumed.  Since then, the city has been racing to get back on top of the outbreak, with draconian new controls put in place, including electronic tagging of all new arrivals, who must undergo a strict 14-day home quarantine, and could face criminal prosecution if they are found in breach of it. Over the weekend, police could be seen patrolling nightlife districts looking for those violating quarantine, arresting at least five people , two of whom had cut their wristbands off in order to go out.  As of Monday, civil servants are working from home again, and many private businesses are expected to follow suit. One of the government's top health advisers has warned that authorities may have to order a more comprehensive shutdown and provide financial assistance to those affected, if it is to contain the new wave of infections.  All non-residents will be barred from the territory as of Wednesday. The city's international airport will also no longer allow travelers to transit through Hong Kong. Anyone arriving in the city will have to undergo testing, regardless of their origin. Many bars and restaurants will also be closed, with initial restrictions focused on those serving alcohol.  Arrivals at Hong Kong airport on March 18 seen wearing heavy protective gear against the novel coronavirus.  No time to relax  Speaking Saturday, Lam said that so far the city has "effectively and safely sailed through two waves of epidemic."  "The first wave was the worries of transmissions from mainland (China), so we have put in a lot of measures," she said. "The second wave was the local transmissions, with those clusters arising from dinners and other things. Now we are facing the third wave."  Lam said that it was "only natural" that as the number of new cases subsides, people start "to relax a bit," and this is what happened towards the start of March. But she said that "in light of the changing circumstances and this most difficult and challenging wave arising from a surge in the global situation and the large number of returnees, then we have to adjust."  Singapore on Sunday introduced stringent new restrictions on travelers from overseas, as that city too struggles with imported cases and a potential second wave. Taiwan, another territory credited with effectively containing the initial outbreak, is also adopting new measures to avoid a spike in imported infections.  In the Chinese capital Beijing, all international flights are now being diverted to other cities in China, as the number of imported cases continues to rise.  Asia is weeks, if not months, ahead of the West when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Countries across Europe and North America were slow to learn from those who had already been through it, leaving themselves vulnerable to the rapidly worsening health crises they are experiencing now.
2020-03-23	Johannesburg (CNN) South Africa will enforce a three-week lockdown over coronavirus, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Monday.  In a televised address to the nation, Ramaphosa said the 21-day lockdown will begin at midnight Thursday and he called on the country to "urgently and dramatically" escalate its response.  "Immediate, swift and extraordinary action is required if we are to avoid human costs of this virus," said Ramaphosa, adding that if the nation failed to act swiftly, it could face "a human catastrophe of enormous proportions."  In the week since the country declared a state of national disaster, the number of confirmed cases has increased sixfold, Ramaphosa said, especially troubling in a country with a large immune-suppressed population of HIV and tuberculosis suffers.  "The action we are taking now will have lasting economic costs," said Ramaphosa. "But we are sure that the cost of not acting now will be far greater."
2020-03-23	One of Chicago’s leading children’s hospitals had to scrap plans to host a mobile testing site, which was scheduled Tuesday on the city’s north side after it said both of its vendors weren’t able to fill orders for testing supplies.  It’s another example of how difficult it can be to get tested for Covid-19.  Julie Pesch, spokesperson for Lurie’s Children’s Hospital, told CNN the site was designed to be for pediatric patients not admitted to the hospital who are experiencing symptoms of the virus.  The hospital was hoping to alleviate an onslaught of pressure both its hospital and individual pediatricians across the city are facing. But because of the high demand for testing and a lack of testing supplies like nasal swabs, those plans were cut short on Friday.  “Our normal operational process is to hold 2-4 days of supply on a product like this. Last week (March 16) when we went to purchase an elevated quantity, due to the Covid-19 needs, we were informed by both our primary and secondary vendors that they were not able to fill orders,” Pesch said  The hospital was hoping parents with an appointment would be able to get a child tested every 15 minutes. But now the hospital says sick patients will need to go through their regular pediatricians for testing.  The lack of supplies to launch such an effort “is a big deal,” Pesch said. “The more testing that we can do, that means the less children that we have in the emergency department, in the pediatrician's office. That means we don’t have to use as much PPE. That is the main message that we’re trying to get across.”  “Other hospitals are in the same situation,” said Danny Chun, spokesperson for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association. The lack of testing supplies remain a problem, he added.  The Advocate Aurora Health hospital system announced Friday that it was suspending a similar program that had already launched because of the national shortage of test kit supplies.
2020-03-23	A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here  London (CNN Business) The United States is now locked in a race against time on two crucial coronavirus fronts - one medical, the other legislative. The speed at which each issue is addressed has huge implications for investors.  The big picture: The number of coronavirus cases in the United States is approaching 35,000. More than 400 people have died in the country.  Nearly half the cases are in New York state, making it the epicenter of the US outbreak. New Yorkers, along with millions of people in at least seven other states, are facing orders to stay at home.  Happening now: President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard units in New York, California and Washington "to carry out approved missions" and as a "backup" to state leaders. Governors will remain in command, Trump said.  Race No. 1: How quickly can the United States contain the coronavirus? Experts say the pressure on stock markets won't lift until the rate of new infections slows dramatically.  Read More
2020-03-24	(CNN) Smoking, drinking, general poor health: Researchers say these are some of the factors that could explain why more men seem to be dying from coronavirus than women.  In countries such as Italy, men represent nearly 60% of people who tested positive for the virus and more than 70% of those who have died, according to the country's National Health Institute (ISS). Even in countries like South Korea, where the proportion of women who have tested positive for the virus is higher than that of men, about 54% of the reported deaths are among men.  But while health officials are starting to take note of these staggering numbers, the United States is not releasing the basic nationwide data that is crucial to understanding who is most vulnerable to the virus, according to a CNN analysis.  Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, said at a White House press briefing on Friday: "From Italy we're seeing another concerning trend. That the mortality in males seems to be twice in every age group of females."  Regarding this data on Italy, Birx said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer: "Just having the knowledge of that helps us in the United States so we can be very specific in talking to the American people about who to protect and how to protect them."  CNN has reached out to Birx for additional comment.  When CNN asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for data split by sex for US cases of coronavirus and deaths by coronavirus, known as sex-disaggregated data, the CDC did not respond.  Comprehensive data about those who have gotten sick could help inform more effective responses to the crisis. But public health researchers say that when governments such as the United States either don't collect, or don't publish their data, it's impossible for experts to gain an accurate sense of what's going on.  Data divided by sex  In collaboration with Global Health 50/50 , a research institute examining gender inequality in global health, CNN analyzed the publicly available data from 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the time of data collection -- March 20.  The aim was to see why men seem to be dying more than women.  From these 20 countries, only six provided data broken down by sex for both confirmed cases and deaths - China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy and South Korea. A further seven provided such data for the number of confirmed cases only. No sex-disaggregated data could be located for the remaining countries. The research has been submitted for publication and has not yet been peer-reviewed.  The data is not comprehensive in all cases: For example, the figures for China only cover the period through the end of February, well before community spread approached zero. And no reliable data exists on the proportion of tests administered to men versus women in any country. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly cases of the virus that are not reflected in the national data for any country.  But across the countries for which we have data - spanning nearly a quarter of the world's population - we found that men were 50% more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19.  While necessarily partial and incomplete, the results highlight what public health experts have been warning for some time, theorizing that it is not only biology but also gendered behaviors -- the different ways in which men and women conduct their lives -- which may play a significant role in the different mortality rate for respiratory diseases.  "When we look at the data what we're seeing is that in every country with sex-disaggregated data ... there is between a 10% and 90% higher rate of mortality amongst people diagnosed with Covid if they are men compared to if they are women," says Sarah Hawkes, professor of global public health at University College London (UCL) and co-director of Global Health 50/50.  "If I was designing clinical guidelines, I would very much want to understand why some people seem to have a much higher risk of mortality than others. It might for example lead to a difference in the way in which we administer clinical guidelines amongst people who have pre-existing health conditions that lead to risk of death along with those with chronic lung disease, who are more likely to be men."  Hawkes also noted that reporting sex-disaggregated data on epidemics has been requested by the World Health Organization since 2007, but many countries fail to do so.  As the US data was not publicly available on a national level, CNN went state by state to request the data, but many did not release it. Even states such as New York and California, where the outbreak is particularly severe, did not provide CNN with the requested data, despite several attempts. In some cases, CNN located the data in press releases from local counties, care homes and hospitals.  "I'm pretty sure that in a country with the sophistication of the health system and the surveillance system that the United States has, that it's not that there's an absence of data," says Hawkes.  "I am fairly sure that down to the smallest districts across the US, people have the data. What we've not seeing happening it seems is a collation, a collection of that data at state and national level with the speed which one might hope to see from the perspective of global health research."  Historically, coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS tended to affect men disproportionately, according to Dr. Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, infectious disease specialist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Texas.  From an evolutionary perspective, some research suggests that women have a stronger immune response against viral infections than men because they spend part of their lives with a foreign body inside -- their offspring -- thus granting them a survival advantage.  "It might have to do with hormonal changes," Ostrosky-Zeichner said. "There is actual research in animals that has shown there may be a biological basis for the sort of increasing susceptibility in the male gender and not only that but also an increased severity and response to the virus."  Pre-existing conditions  Initial reports of people with severe Covid-19 disease have found that they were likely to have underlying health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease, according to Global Health 50/50. These conditions tend to be more common among men in the six countries analyzed as well as globally, the institute said, possibly because of riskier lifestyle choices.  "If Covid-19 is following the same kind of patterns that we see across a range of other diseases, what we know is that men tend to have across their life courses ... greater risks of exposure to behaviors that will lead to adverse health outcomes in the long term," says Hawkes.  "So in most countries, for example, what we see is that men smoke tobacco and drink alcohol at far greater rates than women do," she said.  Smoking is a clear example of how such behavior differs between men and women.  In Italy, 7 million men smoke as opposed to the 4.5 million women, according to 2020 data released by the National Health Institute (ISS)  The institute reported that, upon admission to hospital, "a third more Covid-19-positive smokers had a more serious clinical situation than non-smokers."  For these smokers, the risk of needing intensive care and mechanical ventilation is "more than double.  "If you've got a group of men who have been smokers in their lifetime and then get it [Covid-19] and now have chronic lung disease as a result of the smoking, and then get exposed to corona infection, it seems as if they are more likely to suffer from severe corona infection, and be at risk of death," Hawkes said.  Other studies have shown that Italian men also have higher rates of hypertension than age-matched females, while Chinese men tend to have higher blood pressure and are more likely to have Type 2 diabetes.  All these factors contribute to possible complications if they get the coronavirus, researchers say.  But the lack of data on how many men died of novel coronavirus as opposed to women, Global Health 50/50 researchers say, feels like a missed opportunity for governments to implement public health policies that target certain groups of people who are significantly more vulnerable than the rest of the population.  "What Covid-19 reveals is a classic case of failing to use data for decision making. For every patient there is a record of their sex. But that data is not collated and analyzed with a gender lens," Dr. Kent Buse, co-founder of GH5050 and chief of strategic policy directions at UNAIDS told CNN.  The same view is shared by Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University,  "All data establishing risk, ability to recover, infectivity is crucial in a pandemic," he told CNN. "Data ought to be collected, transparent as to methods, and disseminated promptly."  For as long as this data is not made publicly available, it cannot be analyzed by outside experts, like Global Health 50/50, for clues on why men seem to be dying more from Covid-19.
2020-03-24	(CNN) Both legal and illegal travel at the US borders with Canada and Mexico has drastically changed in the past week following the Trump administration's stringent restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.  Lawful vehicle and pedestrian border traffic is down around 70% compared to normal traffic flow, according to an official from the Department of Homeland Security, who added that people are heeding the instructions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay home and only travel when necessary.  Illegal border crossings, thie vast majority of which occur at the southwest border, are also down, according to sources. Several Customs and Border Protection employees have also tested positive for the coronavirus, sources tell CNN. The agency is the first line of contact for travelers coming into the US.  Last week, the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of promising to immediately return migrants who illegally cross the border to Mexico, Canada or their country of origin, as well as limiting lawful travel at the ports of entry to only essential traffic.  Effective Saturday, CBP began implementing a CDC authority to suspend entry of all migrants who enter the US without proper documentation.  Read More
2020-03-24	(CNN) The absence of coherent guidelines from the White House has created a battle among states and hospitals, which have been hooked into bidding wars over key provisions to combat the coronavirus pandemic , driving up their prices and raising worries that regions in desperate need of immediate aid, like New York City, could be squeezed out and patients left to die.  What is not working, political and public health leaders on the front lines say, is the current, scattershot approach which appears to rely on shaky verbal commitments from major companies, which can turn around and shop for higher prices, and rich individuals, who do not have a clear view of where the greatest need for life-saving equipment resides.  Governors, members of Congress, reality TV stars and private business leaders are all swimming in the void.  Elected officials, like those in New York, have been pleading publicly for President Donald Trump to intervene as the price of medical equipment soars. Georgia GOP Rep. Doug Collins , identifying competition abroad, asked the State Department Tuesday to "impose a temporary ban on all exports" of crucial testing and diagnostic supplies, along with personal protective equipment and more.  The search for resources and provisions has grown increasingly frantic over the past few days, as Trump refuses to exercise his powers under the Defense Production Act , which allows him almost unilateral authority to redirect private industry toward work in the public interest. By leaving the supply chain open to such a wide variety of potential buyers, including the federal government itself, the officials tasked with providing tools to health care workers are being either outbid or overrun by competing interests.  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said his stat e lost out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in an effort to get protective equipment.  "It is a challenge," Beshear said. "The federal government says 'states, you need to go find your supply chain' and then the federal government ends up buying from that supply chain."  After more than a week of tamping down his rhetoric in a bid not to ruffle the President, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday sounded the alarms and argued that, contrary to the rumblings coming from the White House, businesses would welcome the contracts -- and cash -- that come with a presidential directive.  "I need the ventilators in 14 days. Only the federal government has that power. And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me," Cuomo said. "Volunteerism is nice and it is a beautiful thing, and it's nice that these companies are coming forward and saying they want to help. But that is not going to get us there."  Trump, during his daily news conference hours later, showed no inclination to take further action under the auspices of the Defense Production Act, saying it was already working as "leverage" with industry leaders.  Cuomo, along with other governors who have been underwhelmed by initial deliveries from the federal government, skewered the limited stock he's received from officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the state races the clock to obtain critical medical equipment.  "FEMA is sending us 400 ventilators. I saw it on the news this morning. 'We are sending 400 ventilators to New York.' 400 ventilators? I need 30,000 ventilators," Cuomo said. "You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000 ventilators? You're missing the magnitude of the problem, and the problem is defined by the magnitude."  Rather than address Cuomo's material concerns, Trump on Tuesday during a virtual town hall with Fox News instead criticized the governor for not ordering more ventilators years ago, before the coronavirus crisis.  "We are building in hospitals, we are building ... medical centers, and he was complaining -- we are doing differently more than anybody else," Trump said. "(Cuomo) was talking about the ventilators. But he should have ordered the ventilators, and he had a choice. He had a chance."  Later in the day, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference that the number of ventilators directed to the state had been upped to 4,000, with half headed to the city -- an increase from previous reports, but still far short of requests from Cuomo and medical experts.  Fears transcend partisan divide  The anxiety does not simply run down partisan lines.  Earlier in the day, Rep. Liz Cheney, a conservative Republican from Wyoming, rejected Trump's suggestions he would "open up" the country in a couple of weeks in a bid to revive the economy.  "There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what's necessary to stop the virus," Cheney tweeted.  But her message didn't land.  Trump doubled down Tuesday afternoon on his claim that he wants the country "opened up and just raring to go by Easter," just over two weeks from now -- or about the amount of time that White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx said out-of-towners who have recently visited New York should self-quarantine.  State leaders from Iowa to New Mexico, and Oklahoma to Virginia have been sounding similar alarms over dwindling or difficult to restock medical supplies.  Oklahoma Secretary of Health and Human Services Jerome Loughridge told reporters during a briefing that the state will be out of personal protective equipment in nine days. He added that a private company was now chipping in 3D printing abilities to manufacture valves for ventilators.  Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo told reporters that her state is building its own supply chain network "to scour the world to find all the supplies we need in order to do the testing."  "Every state is vying for the resources. Frankly, every country. Most countries are vying for the same resources, so it's a challenge," said Raimondo, a Democrat.  Oregon is facing a similar crunch.  "Both in our requests for personal protective equipment from the national stockpile and our conversations with private suppliers," Oregon Gov. Kate Brown's press secretary, Charles Boyle said, "we find ourselves competing with larger states with more immediate needs due to the size and scope of their COVID-19 outbreaks: New York, California, Washington, and others."  In his Tuesday letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Collins, the Republican House member pushing for a pause on sales abroad of coronavirus prevention and treatment products, said that he was "informed by Northeast Georgia Health System that it faced uncertainty in the fulfillment of its recent purchase of high-speed testing equipment from a domestic company that is refusing any new customers because of a surge in orders from Europe."  Collins also pointed out that other countries, like the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, France and India, had all taken similar steps to preserve their stockpiles.  "The private sector has been an incredible partner in our nationwide effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Its contribution during these times cannot be overstated," Collins wrote. "I do feel it necessary, however, that we provide clear guidance that all production of necessary medical supplies must first be sent to purchasers in the United States until domestic demand has been satisfied."  By late Tuesday afternoon, Ohio's top health official, Dr. Amy Acton, sounded the alarm for her own state. She called the over 560 confirmed coronavirus cases there "the tip of the iceberg" and warned that the state's reserves of personal protective equipment had all been put into the field with health care workers.  "There is a limited supply. That is the truth," Acton said. "We've placed it where it is needed. We are working to determine how to extend use of PPE." (Commonly used personal protective equipment, like masks, is not designed for extended or repeated use).  Now, as time winds down on patients in New York and other hard-hit areas, the search for supplies has increasingly moved outside the usual political and governmental channels.  JUST WATCHED Illinois gov on FEMA supply: It's like the wild west out here Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Illinois gov on FEMA supply: It's like the wild west out here 02:20  Facebook, Tesla and 'Real Housewives'  Desperate health care workers are fundraising on their own and pleading with private citizens to donate what had been common supplies.  There has also an upswing in uncoordinated efforts from rich donors, like Facebook, which is tapping its own "emergency reserve" of medical grade masks, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and "working on sourcing" millions more. Former "Real Housewives of New York" star Bethenny Frankel has also become an unlikely source of aid, with a pledge to donate more than 1.5 million masks.  Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, delivered more than 1,000 ventilators to California, but the confusion that followed the news underscored broader communication issues. In response to a Twitter thread speculating on where the equipment came from, Musk said he had purchased it from overseas.  "China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA," Musk said. "If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"  Frustration over the Wild West-style market for these essential medical goods has bubbled up with increasing heat over the past few days. Speaking to reporters, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker underscored the absurd push-and-pull between government officials and manufacturers.  "In one case (a ventilator maker) told me I was competing with FEMA to acquire ventilators. So they told me I'm competing against the federal government to get ventilators from the state of Illinois. And the federal government is not distributing ventilators to the state of Illinois, so I'm literally working against a competitor," Pritzker said, relaying a story he told Trump.  Before he could answer a question about the President's response, Pritzker offered a second example.  "I called another manufacturer of ventilators and he pointed out to me that I would be competing with countries other than the United States as I put an order in," Pritzker said, and "that I better put in as big of an order as possible in order to put myself higher on the list of priority to get ventilators from that manufacturer."  Like other governors in states facing shortages, California's Gavin Newsom has said his administration is striking out on its own in search of supplies.  "I want to just be sober and direct to you and those who may be watching: We are not counting on the (federal government's) strategical stockpile to solve this problem," Newsom said during a news conference from Sacramento on Monday. "We're out there procuring the PPE from sources domestically within the state of California, already repurposing businesses that are already stepping up to meet this need, and going across the world to address our supply chain."  But that process, as both Pritzker and Cuomo have said, can create a destructive clash of supply and demand. Without intervention from Trump, the states -- which operate on tighter budgets than the federal government -- are repeatedly being drawn into bidding wars.  "Many of us are competing for the same limited supplies, and as a consequence of that, people are tripping over themselves to make deals that ultimately are raising the cost of these supplies," Newsom told reporters Monday night.
2020-03-24	New Delhi (CNN) India's normally bustling streets are quiet. Delivery drivers wear gloves and face masks. Even the country's unrelenting construction has come to a halt.  It's all part of India's unprecedented 21-day bid to stop the coronavirus pandemi c in its tracks with a nationwide lockdown.  India is the world's second-most populous country and has the fifth-biggest economy, with trade connections all over the world. Yet despite its size, the country of 1.34 billion appears to have avoided the full hit of the pandemic. To date, India has only 492 confirmed cases of coronavirus and nine deaths. By contrast, South Korea -- which has a population only 3.8% the size of India's -- has more than 9,000 cases.  China, where the outbreak was first identified, has more than 81,000 confirmed cases in a population of 1.39 billion.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained there is no sign of community spread, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised India's swift response, which has included grounding domestic and international commercial flights and suspending all tourist visas.  On Tuesday night, Modi ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown starting at midnight Wednesday. The order, the largest of its type yet to be issued globally, means all Indians must stay at home and all nonessential services such as public transport, malls and market will be shut down.  But fears are growing that the country remains susceptible to a wider, potentially more damaging outbreak. Experts have cautioned that India is not testing enough people to know the true extent of the issue -- and have questioned the viability and sustainability of a nationwide lockdown.  Doctors are seen in front of an insloation ward for coronavirus patients in Amritsar, Punjab, on March 7, 2020.  In an interview with CNN last week, the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said India had taken all the necessary steps to prepare for the virus, and had been communicating well with the public.  "Having said that, of course, we always have to prepare for a worse outcome," Swaminathan said. "It's better to be overprepared and to be overcautious than to be caught off guard."  How bad is the outbreak in India?  So far, India has confirmed relatively few cases -- but the country is also testing relatively few people.  In total, 15,000 tests have been conducted, compared with South Korea, where well over 300,000 people out of its 52 million population have been tested.  O.C. Abraham, a professor of medicine at Christian Medical College in Vellore in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said that India should test extensively, just as South Korea did.  A pedestrian using a handkerchief as a facemask walks past graffiti raising awareness about the pandemic, in Mumbai, on March 23, 2020.  "The only way you can control a disease like this is that you test early and you quarantine them," he said.  But Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said there is no need for "indiscriminate testing." At a news briefing on Sunday, he said the country has a test capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 per week. By comparison, the United Kingdom -- a country with 5% of the population size of India -- says it is hoping to increase its test capacity to 25,000 a day.  Although the numbers are comparatively small, Modi has cautioned against being complacent, and said the assumption that the disease will not impact India is incorrect.  Like other countries, many of India's confirmed cases have been connected to overseas travelers. The first six cases in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, for instance, were all contacts of the first case reported in New Delhi, who had a travel history to Italy.  Overseas, these sorts of clusters often spread into the local community, leading to a wider outbreak.  According to Bellur Prabhakar, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Illinois, there are a few reasons why the number of confirmed cases in India do not match international trends.  It could be due to a lack of testing, said Prabhakar, noting that "ignorance is bliss."  Security personnel wear face masks as they check the temperature of visitors to a hospital in Bangalore on March 16, 2020.  Another possible reason is that coronavirus may thrive in colder conditions , meaning that it might not spread so efficiently in India, where temperatures are often more than 30 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Farenheit).  We know that influenza thrives in cold and dry conditions, but we don't yet know if coronavirus follows the same pattern. Experts have cautioned against drawing too many conclusions yet , pointing to the many unknowns that remain about the virus itself and its spread in recent months.  But if the spread of coronavirus isn't impacted by temperatures, that could be a problem for India.  "Unless the virus goes away because of the heat ... I cannot imagine what could happen in India," Prabhakar said.  Why an outbreak could be hard to control  Although it's not yet clear why India's case numbers are relatively low, as with other countries, it's clear that an outbreak would be incredibly difficult to control.  A growing number of governments are encouraging citizens to self-isolate, and wash their hands to control the spread of coronavirus. But in parts of India, even those basic measures would be extremely difficult.  In 2011, an Indian government report estimated that 29.4% of the country's urban population live in low quality, semi-permanent structures, known as slums.  Many of the homes here don't have bathrooms or running water. Some slum residents get their water from a communal tap, while others collect theirs in canisters and buckets from tankers that visit a few times a week.  In this Tuesday, March 17, 2020 photo, a woman fills a plastic bottle next to a drain filled with plastic and other filth at a slum in New Delhi, India.  This all makes it difficult to wash hands regularly. "Where on earth are they going to find the water and soap that they need?" questioned Prabhakar. "I think it's going to be nearly impossible to implement that plan."  It may also prove difficult to maintain the type of social isolation as ordered by Modi. In India, there are 455 people per square kilometer (or 1,178 people per square mile), according to World Bank statistics -- significantly more than the world average of 60 people , and much higher than China's 148  "Social distancing in a country like India is going to be very, very challenging," Prabhakar said. "We might be able to pull it off in urban areas, but in slums and areas of urban sprawl, I just don't see how it can be done."  Countries around the world have launched education campaigns advising people to sneeze into their elbow and avoid touching their face. But sharing that information with a population as large as India's will also be a challenge, he said.  The challenge of going into lockdown  Every country that goes into lockdown faces a huge economic impact. But in India, telling people to stay home puts millions of jobs at risk.  According to official statistics from 2011-2012 -- the most recent data available -- there were around 400 million people in India's labor market. Of those, more than half were self-employed, and 121 million were casual workers, meaning they had irregular work and were only paid for the days they worked.  Those people -- India's cleaners, household workers, and construction workers -- are exactly the people who could be hurt by lockdowns.  The Ministry of Labor and Employment has issued a notice to businesses, asking them not to terminate employees or cut salaries.  A man walks on a deserted path leading to India Gate during a government-imposed lockdown in New Delhi on March 24, 2020.  Modi has already expressed his concern for the millions of workers who rely on a daily wage. "In such a time of crisis, I request the business world and high income segments of society to as much as possible, look after the economic interests of all the people who provide them services," he said.  "In the coming few days it is possible these people may not be able to come to office or your homes. In such a case, do treat them with empathy and humanity and not deduct their salaries. Always keep in mind that they too need to run their homes, protect their families from illness."  Chief minister of northern Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath said that each of the 1.5 million daily wage laborers in his state will be given 1,000 rupees ($13) via direct transfer to help them meet their daily needs.  "That might end up saving lots of lives if the government has a program to basically issue a paycheck to all those daily workers and people who earn below a certain level of income," Prabhakar said.  But even if the authorities are able to roll out financial help for daily wage workers, not everyone will benefit.  According to government estimates , there are around 102 million people -- including 75 million children -- who do not have an Aadhaar identity card, which is used to access key welfare and social services including food, electricity and gas subsidies. Most of these people are essentially undocumented -- and are less likely to receive a government handout.  People clap from balconies in show of appreciation to health care workers in Mumbai, India on March 22, 2020.  Other difficulties facing India  On top of all of these issues, India also has an overburdened and underprepared health system.  "The public health sector is woefully inadequate," said Prabhakar, explaining that there is a lack of medical supplies and trained staff in India.  As the WHO's Swaminathan said, the health system across India is quite variable.  "There are some states with very well-resourced, well-equipped health systems, and others which are weaker," Swaminathan said. "So the focus really needs to be both in short term and the medium to long term on strengthening the health systems in those states where it is relatively weak and this would involve a number of different actions."  According to Christian Medical College's Abraham, there are only about 50 to 60 specialists in India who have received formal structured training in handling infectious diseases.  According to the World Bank, India spends about 3.66% of its GDP on health -- far below the world average of 10%. Although the United Kingdom and the US have struggled to deal with their own outbreaks, each spend 9.8% and 17% of their GDP on health, respectively.  At a news conference on Monday, Lav Agarwal, a senior official with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said the government is working with all of India's states to increase the capacity of health facilities.
2020-03-24	Vienna, Austria (CNN) Henrik Lerfeldt has fond memories of Kitzloch, a popular restaurant and bar in the Austrian ski resort town of Ischgl, where he partied several nights while on vacation three weeks ago.  The 56-year-old Dane, who spoke to CNN from self-quarantine at his home 50 miles from Copenhagen last week, said that his time in Kitzloch in the Austrian province of Tyrol was the way "after-ski" is supposed to be. "Lots of people, lots of drinks, and nice waiters happy to serve you more."  Four days after his return home, Lerfeldt tested positive for the coronavirus , or Covid-19, as did one of his friends he was traveling with. But they are just two among hundreds of people from all over Europe whose infections are traced back to Ischgl, some of them directly to Kitzloch, according to European authorities.  Kitzloch declined to comment when contacted by CNN for comment. Its owner, Bernhard Zangerl, told German news site t-online on March 16 that his employees must have also contracted the virus from someone, and the site reports Zangerl as saying it was audacious to try to pin this on one company.  Despite an official warning from the Icelandic government on March 4 that a group of its nationals had contracted coronavirus in Ischgl, Austrian authorities allowed ski tourism -- and the partying that goes with it -- to continue for another nine days before fully quarantining the resort on March 13. Bars in Ischgl were closed on March 10.  Even after a bartender tested positive for the virus, the medical authority of Tyrol -- where ski tourism is one of the biggest economic drivers -- reiterated in a press release on March 8 that there was "no reason to worry." CNN has reached out to Franz Katzgraber, the director of Tyrol's medical authority, for further comment and not received a response.  Ischgl and its neighboring villages draw around 500,000 visitors each winter, with high-profile celebrities and politicians such as Paris Hilton, Naomi Campbell and Bill Clinton among them in previous years.  After a string of rebuttals that the town and bar were linked to the spread of the virus, Austrian authorities have since conceded that they were.  In a statement emailed to CNN last week, the provincial government denied it had dragged its feet, saying it acted in a timely and efficient manner. "With the measures taken, the authorities were able to contain the continuation of the chain of infections," Bernhard Tilg, Tyrol's provincial councilor responsible for health, care facilities, science, and research, said in the statement.  In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, the public prosecutor's office in Innsbruck said it had commissioned the Tyrol Criminal Police Office to conduct "investigations on suspicion of negligent endangerment of people by communicable diseases." The prosecutor's office added that it was looking into the possibility that a catering company did not report an employee's positive coronavirus test at the end of February.  Health experts say alarm bells were missed  The assistant to the director of health at the Icelandic health directorate told CNN that the country's chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason informed Austrian authorities on March 4 that several Icelandic tourists were infected with the virus while in Ischgl. Gudnason used Europe's official Early Warning and Response System, the directorate confirmed in an email.  On March 5, the day after Iceland notified Austria that Icelandic tourists had contracted Covid-19, Reykjavik added Ischgl to its list of risk zones for Covid-19 transmission, putting the risk of infection in the village on par with China, South Korea, Italy and Iran.  Jan Pravsgaard Christensen, a professor of immunology of infectious diseases, at the University of Copenhagen, told CNN that Iceland's listing should have immediately raised alarm bells.  "Considering that it is a place where people are in close contact in bars, restaurants, and so on, once they know of ... people infected in the same area, they should have initiated a quarantine very quickly," he said.  However, regional authorities in Tyrol downplayed the risk. In a first official reaction to Iceland's listing, Katzgraber said in a March 5 press release that it was "unlikely" there was contagion in Tyrol.  Based on a statement by a single traveler who said that a sick tourist who had visited Italy shared the same flight home to Iceland, Katzgraber said in the same press release that the group of Icelandic tourists likely contracted the virus after they left Austria, giving no evidence.  Oral beer pong and sharing whistles  On March 7 -- three days after Iceland's warning -- a 36-year-old bartender at Kitzloch tested positive. Twenty-two of the bartender's contacts were quarantined, 15 of whom have since tested positive for Covid-19, the provincial government confirmed in press releases.  The outbreak had spread far beyond the Tyrol.  The most recent available Danish government figures show that out of more than 1,400 cases in Denmark, 298 contracted the virus in Austria. In comparison, only 61 cases are linked to travel to Italy, so far the hardest-hit country in Europe.  As of March 20, Icelandic authorities are aware of eight people who got infected with coronavirus in Ischgl specifically, the health authority told CNN.  "At first, we didn't understand how this many cases could have happened," Christensen, who had been briefed by experts working on Iceland's response to the pandemic, said. But a clearer picture emerged when officials worked out what was going on in some of Ischgl's tightly packed bars and clubs.  "We realized that they exchanged saliva because they were playing beer pong," using their mouths, he said, although he did not single out any specific bars where the game took place. The game involved spitting ping pong balls out of their mouths into beer glasses, and those balls were then reused by other people.  Lerfeldt reported that Kitzloch bartenders, including the 36-year-old who later tested positive for coronavirus, blew on a brass whistle to get people to move out of their way as they took shots to customers. Several customers also blew the whistle for fun, Lerfeldt said. "I can see why people would want to whistle it -- and nobody knew he was sick," Lerfeldt said.  Monika Redlberger-Fritz, head of the influenza department at the Medical University of Vienna, told CNN that the way the virus spread in Ischgl means there was likely at least one person who infected a large number of other people.  "That means that there was at least one patient who had a very high viral load, and while most people will infect two to three others on average, these people can transmit the disease to 40, 50, or 80 people." Redlberger-Fritz said that this may have cut the lead time for authorities to react by several days.  Anita Luckner-Hornischer, an official with Tyrol's medical authority, said in a press release on March 8 that "a transmission of the virus onto the guests of the bar is, from a medical point of view, rather unlikely." She gave no evidence.  Authorities closed down Kitzloch on March 9 and said there was no increased risk of transmission.  By March 10, Günther Platter, the provincial governor of Tyrol, said at a press conference that all new cases confirmed in the province that day -- 16 in total -- were tied to a single bar and one of its barkeepers. Local authorities later confirmed the bar to be Kitzloch, the small but bustling bar where Lerfeldt said he and his friends partied for five nights.  "We have found that the risk of infection is very high in the bars. All cases go back to one bar," Platter said at the press conference.  Hundreds of cases traced back to Ischgl  At least four countries have now reported links to Ischgl, showing how the tiny village, home to no more than 1,600 permanent residents, became a major vector in spreading Covid-19.  Alongside Denmark and Iceland, Germany has traced about 300 cases back to Ischgl, more than 80 of them in Hamburg and 200 in the small city of Aalen, according to German media. CNN has been unable to independently verify these figures.  The count is so high that Aalen set up a new email address specifically for people who have visited Ischgl to get in touch with authorities. In a virtual press conference on March 17, the health minister of the German state Baden-Württemberg said, according to German state news agency DPA: "Our problem isn't called Iran, it's Ischgl."  Norway also confirmed that, as of March 20, 862 out of its 1,742 cases were contracted abroad, and said it traced 549 of them back to Austria, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.  Kitzloch has a capacity for 100 people and, when Lerfeldt was there, was packed with patrons from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany, he said.  When the national government announced a lockdown of the area on the afternoon of March 13 -- nine days after Iceland's notification -- the remaining tourists were asked to leave the village and return home without stopping.  Most returned straight to their respective home countries, Tilg, the provincial councilor responsible for health, care facilities and research, told Austrian public broadcaster ORF, but hotel owners in the provincial capital of Innsbruck confirmed to local media that hundreds of Ischgl tourists who were stranded that Friday afternoon checked into their establishments to wait for flights Saturday.  "The authorities acted correctly in every aspect," Tilg reiterated several times in the ORF interview on March 16, and rejected all criticisms in an email to CNN.  Tilg blamed the spread of the virus in Tyrol -- which accounts for about a quarter of Austria's more than 4,400 coronavirus cases as of March 23 -- on tourists who either carried it into the province or did not follow regional authorities' advice to return home immediately.  Europe is now the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and the European Union has closed its borders to all non-essential travel as it attempts to slow its spread. The Austrian government put Ischgl under full quarantine on March 13. Five days later, on March 18, local officials extended these measures and ordered all 279 communities in Tyrol to isolate themselves.  While Lerfeldt and his friends say they have fully recovered, Christensen said that it is impossible to determine the number of people who were infected by Ischgl's ski tourists once they returned home, to countries all over Europe.
2020-03-24	Candida R. Moss holds a chair in theology at the University of Birmingham in England and is author of "Divine Bodies: Resurrecting Perfection in the New Testament and Early Christianity" (Yale University Press, 2019). The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) This week, as stores, restaurants and other businesses shuttered their doors to help stem the spread of coronavirus, a number of conservative Christians chose to frame their response to the pandemic in a different way: as an opportunity to choose "faith over fear."  Writing in First Things, which describes itself as "America's most influential journal of religion & public life," editor Rusty Reno wrote that "the mass shutdown of society to fight the spread of COVID-19 creates a perverse, even demonic atmosphere."  Reno argues that fear of death is being allowed to distort social order. "Everything for the sake of physical life? What about justice, beauty, and honor? There are many more things precious than life (...) The Eucharist itself is now subordinated to the false god of 'saving lives.'"  Reno is not alone, though many churches have responded to spread of Covid-19 by going virtual. Cardinal Raymond Burke -- while affirming the need for safety measures such as social distancing and regular cleaning -- recently argued that church attendance should nonetheless be considered an "essential" behavior akin to grocery shopping. A pastor in Louisiana held a crowded service for more than 1,825 congregants last Sunday on the basis that he "hold(s) our religious rights dear" and believes that the virus is "politically motivated."  Early reports about the spread of coronavirus in South Korea linked "more than half" of the country's 3,730 cases to the Shinchenoji Church of Jesus, a religious group that the government describes as a cult. Religious communities have the potential to provide support, comfort and spiritual nourishment to members -- but they can also become hotspots for the virus.  While religious activity may be an essential part of people's lives, the assumption that social distancing equates to spiritual estrangement is up for debate. Should religious freedom be allowed to put the lives of the many at risk? If the 12 disciples could miss the crucifixion and still become saints, can't Christians skip church for a few weeks and still make it into heaven?  As a New Testament scholar and a high-risk patient (I am immunocompromised following a life-saving kidney transplant), I would argue that they do not. Parables like that of the " lost sheep " emphasize that the whole group must compromise when the life of a single person is at stake.  Having written three books about early Christian martyrdom, I can confidently say that God's guardianship does not mean protection from physical suffering or death. During periods when they were socially marginalized or persecuted, a number of bishops and high-profile Christians went into exile -- its own form of social distancing -- in order to avoid death.  Then, as now, the ability to remove oneself from harm's way was a matter of social privilege. Only the wealthy could choose flight.  There are all kinds of ways that people can envision the Christian response to coronavirus. Some might say that qualified Christians -- medical workers, emergency personnel, food industry workers -- should put themselves on the front lines by caring for others, which they are already doing. They have done so historically, in the early church, when plagues struck their communities  For the majority of people (including Pope Francis ), practicing social distancing and protecting the most vulnerable is the Christian way. It's the embodied interpretation of love thy neighbor. Interestingly, it is religious conservatives who are pushing back against social distancing norms.  What is most frightening about these latest expressions of "religious freedom" is not just that they threaten to place others at risk, but that religious conservatives form a substantial part of Donald Trump's voter base -- his plan to reopen by Easter may be well timed to speak to them.  In the past two months, the President has already spread misinformation and generally dragged his feet . If inaction and noncompliance with government guidelines starts to be framed as question of religious freedom, then it could further stall the widespread implementation of stricter guidelines. No individual's religious freedom should be able to threaten public health, and certainly not because those who prioritize religious freedom tend to vote Republican  Moreover, Liberty University, one of the biggest and most influential names in Christian education, announced Tuesday that it would choose to reopen despite the crisis. While it did not cite faith as a reason to do so, it does signal to its followers that it's OK to do the same.  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook  For the past 40 years, pro-life religious conservatives have argued that in opposing abortion and euthanasia they fight for society's most vulnerable: the unborn and the elderly. Given that people older than 70 and pregnant women are at high risk for severe illness , the unborn and elderly may face severe complications from the virus.  If Christian conservatives want to practice what they preach, it is in quiet care, rather than reckless faith-driven bravado, that salvation lies.
2020-03-24	Washington (CNN) The US has reached out to South Korea and other nations for help in getting enough supplies to fight the coronavirus pandemic in a sharp counterpoint to President Donald Trump's narrative that the domestic response is enough to combat the crisis.  Seoul's Blue House issued a statement describing a Tuesday call between Trump and President Moon Jae-In that focused on the outbreak. Trump used the conversation to ask Moon if South Korea could provide medical equipment to the United States, the Blue House said. A White House readout of the same call made no mention of Trump's appeal.  The White House request to South Korea appears to be just one of several it has made to allies and other countries for equipment to fight the novel coronavirus . Foreign Policy magazine reported that the State Department sent US ambassadors in eastern Europe and Eurasia to ask their hosts to "ramp up exports and production of life-saving medical equipment and protective gear for the United States."  A senior State Department official said Tuesday that they've "reached out to missions and have asked missions to determine whether certain countries may have excess capacity, the ability to manufacture supplies" and are tracking them with the hopes of matching up "external suppliers, external sources, with states and entities in the US that actually need them."  Trump, meanwhile, has insisted that the US production of equipment needed to meet the viral threat is proceeding apace. But conflicting signals from the administration, the Blue House statement and the increasingly vocal desperation of state leaders were among multiple signals Tuesday that the President's narrative doesn't completely reflect reality.  The White House has not responded to CNN's requests for comment about the Blue House statement. The senior State Department official said they were "not aware of any specific asks of any particular country."  'A tremendous amount'  "The fact is that we are doing a tremendous amount," Trump said Saturday, during a White House coronavirus briefing with reporters. "We started with very few masks. We had some, but nothing for an event like this. And now we're making tens of millions of masks and other things."  On Sunday, Trump again emphasized US readiness. "But we have millions of masks being done. We have respirators. We have ventilators. We have a lot of things happening right now."  But on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US military would likely face shortages of medical supplies until the private sector can ramp up production. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor told CNN on Tuesday that the administration will start wielding emergency federal powers to produce testing kits -- just minutes after Trump insisted those authorities are not needed.  Also on Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo gave voice to the frustrations of governors across the country when he blasted the White House response after Trump boasted of sending New York -- now the epicenter of the US outbreak -- 400 ventilators.  "FEMA says, 'We're sending 400 ventilators.' Really? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000," Cuomo, a Democrat, said at his daily press conference, in which he updated the state's tally to 210 coronavirus-related deaths and 25,665 known infections.  "You pick the 26,000 who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators," he said. "I don't need ventilators in six months. And I sure don't need ventilators in five months, four months or three months. ... It is now."  State leaders across the country have been scrambling to make up major gaps in critical medical equipment they need to combat coronavirus as the outbreak spreads rapidly across the country, saying the federal government still isn't fully addressing their pleas for millions of masks, ventilators and other supplies.  As of Tuesday at noon, the US had at least 48,000 coronavirus cases and 600 deaths.  States are feeling enough strain that Republican Georgia Rep. Doug Collins urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Tuesday to temporarily ban exports of medical supplies related to the virus, saying that he has heard from state health officials that they are having trouble obtaining equipment because US companies are receiving an influx of European orders.  Cuomo touched on the debate raging between states and the White House and within the administration itself about the Defense Production Act, the 1950 law that allows the federal government to direct domestic production in response to emergencies.  States have said they need Trump to take over distribution because the current process forces the 50 states to compete with one another, the federal government and hospitals to obtain medical supplies.  "Nobody is going to build 40,000 ventilators unless they know someone is going to buy them," Cuomo said, referring to the law's de facto guarantees to companies that the government will buy their production. "That's what the DPA is for. The federal government can say they will buy it."  'Actually going to use the DPA'  While the President is willing to ask other governments for help, so far he has been reluctant to use all the tools at his government's disposal.  Trump has signed the DPA but has not actually used it, bowing to pressure from business leaders who say there are too many unknowns and have instead volunteered to produce whatever is needed to avoid having Trump use those powers. The President reflected their views in a Sunday tweet, saying that when the DPA was announced "it sent tremors" through the business community.  On Tuesday morning, the President took to Twitter again to say, "The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States."  Minutes later, Gaynor told CNN the administration will start wielding "the allocation portion of the DPA" for 60,000 tests kits starting today. While the priorities provision of the DPA is commonly used in emergencies to ensure that government orders get filled first, the allocation portion hasn't been used since the Cold War.  Invoking that element of the law gives the government authority to completely control the entire supply chain, from forcing companies to manufacture critically needed items, to taking over distribution and allocation of those supplies.  "Just a little while ago my team came in and we're actually going to use the DPA for first time today," Gaynor said, speaking with CNN's John Berman.  In addition, FEMA will "insert some language into these mask contracts we have of 500 million masks," Gaynor said. "DPA language will be in that today."  Gaynor's comments caught top White House officials off guard. One said they did not know what Gaynor was referencing and was still trying to figure it out in the hours after he was on television.  Elsewhere in the administration, Esper told a service members' town hall that the US military would likely face some shortages of medical supplies like personal protective equipment, or PPE, until the private sector can ramp up production.  "We have strategic stockpiled medical supplies, we have enough that we were able to offer to the interagency team a supply of masks and gowns and ventilators and things like that," Esper said. "Now, like everybody else, we're going to face shortages with regard to some of the PPE until the private sector industry can pick up the slack."  Esper signaled a shift the Pentagon made Tuesday to limit elective surgeries to free up doctors, nurses and other medical professionals and at the same time reduce the demand for personal protective equipment.  The Pentagon has expressed its thanks to South Korea for supplying coronavirus tests for US military use until American testing equipment arrived on the peninsula. On Tuesday, the Blue House said that South Korea was once again happy to come to Washington's aid.  According to the Blue House, Moon responded to Trump's request for equipment by saying, "If there's spare in the country, (we) will support as much as possible," and telling Trump that FDA approval might be needed for the medical equipment. According to the statement, Trump said he would take action so any South Korean exports could be approved immediately.  The Blue House version of the call contrasts with a White House readout, which said the two leaders discussed "their nations' respective efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic," but made no mention of the US request for support.  As the US asks its allies for help, China is extending them a helping hand, exporting medical supplies and doctors to pandemic stricken countries such as Italy, where Milan received 25 tons of medical equipment from China Tuesday.
2020-03-24	Greg Bowker/Getty Images  New Zealand has recorded a 30% jump in coronavirus cases as the country heads into lockdown by the end of day Wednesday, according to Ashley Bloomfield, the country's Director of Health.  There are 47 new confirmed cases and three new probable cases, bringing the Pacific nation's count up to 205, Bloomfield said at a news conference on Wednesday.  What is a probable case? New Zealand is including probable cases in its national count going forward, which includes people who present with coronavirus symptoms and have exposure history despite a negative test.  Bloomfield said the government will continue to see a rise for the next 10 days before a turnaround.
2020-03-25	(CNN) The No. 1 rule of a successful stimulus is to get it out quickly and flood the zone. The federal government already got two packages out the door , but the one agreed to in the wee hours of Wednesday morning is a whole different level -- a record $2 trillion in government spending .  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this is a "wartime level of investment." But moving something this large ... is like turning an aircraft carrier. It's hard to accomplish at high speeds.  The Senate approved the deal late Wednesday, 96-0 -- a unanimous vote. CNN's Manu Raju, Clare Foran, Ted Barrett and Kristin Wilson report that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Wednesday evening ahead of Senate passage that the House will convene at 9 a.m. on Friday to consider the relief package. The plan is to pass the bill by voice vote, a move that would allow the House to avoid forcing all members to return to Washington for a recorded roll call vote. President Donald Trump has indicated he will sign it.  What's in the bill?  Stimulus checks! -- Most Americans will get some kind of help from the latest draft of this bill (it's still a draft!). But not everyone. About 90% of Americans would be eligible for some kind of payment, according to one estimate.

About 90% of Americans would be eligible for some kind of payment, according to one estimate. Read here for Katie Lobosco and Tami Luhby's breakdown.  Key element: $250 billion to give up to $1,200 to individuals, $2,400 to couples, $500 per child -- However, the payments would start to phase out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000, and those making more than $99,000 would not qualify at all. The thresholds are doubled for couples.  When will checks be mailed? Not clear. -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration expects to issue them within three weeks of the stimulus package being signed into law. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration expects to issue them within three weeks of the stimulus package being signed into law. But seriously, probably not until May, experts told CNN. The government is not at full capacity since lots of employees are working from home. In-person tax centers, for instance, have been closed. The IRS is still going to have to calculate payments, find people and figure out how to pay them.  What if you lose your job and a one-time check is nice, but ...? -- The bill includes an equal amount of money -- $250 billion -- to greatly expand unemployment benefits, providing them to gig workers and The bill includes an equal amount of money -- $250 billion -- to greatly expand unemployment benefits, providing them to gig workers and amping up payments on four months of unemployment by $600 a week. Again, some Republican senators -- starting with Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina -- have said the bill incentivizes unemployment and they could block it. So we'll see what happens.  More money in the bill for companies than for individuals -- A lot of the help is in the form of loans and there are conditions intended to make companies keep employees on the payroll. That includes:  - $350 billion in loans to small businesses in the hopes they keep people employed.  - $500 billion in bailouts for firms, including the airline industry, companies deemed necessary for national security.  - Billions to stockpile medical supplies.  Plus there's $150 billion in direct aid to states, although states like New York have already said they'll need more than their chunk of that pie.  What's else is inside? -- We're still finding out! And many lawmakers will vote on this thing without reading it all.  In the grand tradition of must-pass urgently needed bills, figuring out what's actually in the sausage is an interesting exercise. CNN had a group going line by line through it all (or at least the latest draft). Read the full story, written by a full (virtual) reading room of people, here.  Some of what they've found:  - No money for any of (or Cabinet members or members of Congress or their families) from Treasury Department loans President Donald Trump's businesses (or Cabinet members or members of Congress or their families) from Treasury Department loans  - No money for the border wall  - Airlines and airports get what they wanted -- That's $32 billion in grants for airline wages, more for contractors and $25 billion in loans. This aid includes conditions that bar furloughs and stock buybacks, caps on executive compensation and more.  - Student loan payments suspended through September -- The Education Department is already - The Education Department is already giving people 60 days  - Protections against foreclosures and evictions for 60-plus days -- The legislation says that servicers of federally backed mortgage loans may not begin the foreclosure process for 60 days from March 18.  - Money for the arts -- The draft includes The draft includes $25 million for the Kennedy Center.  Where's the money come from? -- Flash back to when people were concerned about deficits and debt. Flash back to when people were concerned about deficits and debt. Everyone in the country needs to learn right this second about Modern Monetary Theory. Print the money. Help the people.  What's going on with the actual pandemic?  "Last week when I went to work, we talked about the one or two patients amongst the dozens of others that might have been a Covid or coronavirus patient," Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday.  "In my shift yesterday, nearly every single patient that I took care of was coronavirus, and many of them extremely severe. Many were put on breathing tubes. Many decompensated quite quickly."  US privately asks for foreign help  The US, overwhelmed and unprepared for a public health crisis of this scale, is now asking other countries for help. Read this from CNN's Nicole Gaouette:  In a list obtained by CNN, the State Department lays out 25 items, telling diplomats to ask their host countries for these supplies with a clear priority on items available "today" and a secondary focus on equipment and items available in weeks.  ...  The administration is making these private appeals as Trump is striking a starkly different note in public. At Tuesday's daily coronavirus briefing from the White House, not long after he had called the South Korean leader, the President veered into campaign-style rhetoric, declaring that, "America will never be a supplicant nation."  Why is Germany doing better?  We've seen comparisons between South Korea, which has a low number of Covid-19 deaths compared with infections, and Italy, which is very high.  Now there are similar looks at Germany.  Why have certain countries done better than others at keeping their Covid-19 mortality rates down?  Here are some educated guesses with regard to Germany from Kent Sepkowitz, a CNN medical analyst. He looks and finds important considerations about:  who is infected in various countries.  how they're being diagnosed (access to testing!).  the different health care systems.  As simple as nurses? One bottom line he proposes is that the number of nurses per capita is higher in Germany and nurses are the backbone of the health care system.  Trump is as popular as he's ever been  CNN's Chris Cillizza has been looking at polls that show a bump in approval for Trump and how he's handling the crisis.  On one level, this isn't terribly surprising. Polling consistently shows a rallying effect around the president when major crises face the country. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, for example, President George W. Bush's approval rating soared into the high 80s and low 90s. There's a tendency for even partisans of the opposite party from the president to soften a bit in their perception of him as we are reminded of our common humanity and the need for our leaders to, well, lead us out of crisis.  On another, however, Trump's high approval ratings for how he has dealt with coronavirus and how he is handling the job more broadly might well shock people who have been keeping close track of his and his administration's performance on the pandemic.  After all, it's quite clear that the administration simply didn't take the threat of coronavirus seriously enough soon enough. And the testing capabilities for coronavirus in the US were decidedly slow. And Trump's public statements have been marked by inaccurate claims (the test is "perfect," the vaccine is coming fast, etc).  But what the Gallup and Monmouth numbers seem to suggest is that either  a) people aren't following every single statement made by Trump on this matter or  b) they don't hold him personally responsible for the hiccups along the way.  This story has been updated with the Senate passage of the bill and additional details from the legislation.
2020-03-25	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his administration have been criticized over the rate of coronavirus testing in the US, but on Wednesday, he claimed the US had done more testing than any other nation.  At a press briefing a day earlier, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters, "We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those -- over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days."  Less than a day later, the President tweeted : "Just reported that the United States has done far more 'testing' than any other nation, by far! In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span." He reiterated this claim multiple times in a press briefing Wednesday evening.  Facts First: While the US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered, it has conducted far fewer tests per capita given the US population is more than six times larger than South Korea's.

2020-03-25	Tomorrow's jobless claims data will shine a bright light on the ugly economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis.  Economists expect 1 million people to have filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 21, which would be the highest figure ever recorded. But the number could be even higher. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) estimated more than 2 million people have filed claims. Morgan Stanley (MS) and the Economic Policy Institute expect as many as 3.4 million claims.  State labor departments across the the country are struggling to cope with the influx of claims.  The coronavirus outbreak has forced businesses across the country to shut down and lay off workers, at least temporarily.  Following tomorrow’s report, investors will attempt to quantify the total losses to be experienced, and the corresponding impact on the unemployment rate," said Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse. "While neither is knowable, an extremely rough rule of thumb would be a 1% increase in the unemployment rate for every 1.5 million jobs lost ."  The US Department of Labor will release the weekly claims data tomorrow at 8:30 am ET.
2020-03-25	(CNN) A leading epidemiologist advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated the peak of deaths in the US coronavirus pandemic will be three weeks from now, after which "most of the damage will be done," and says it may be possible to only isolate the vulnerable , allowing many back to work.  The CDC confirmed that Ira Longini, professor at the Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases at the University of Florida, is a "funded partner." The agency said he works with them on Covid-19 modeling.  Modeling is not precise, and uses known data to project trends in disease spread, and there were dissenting opinions expressed to CNN about Longini's analysis. Yet two other disease experts broadly agreed with the estimate.  Longini's suggestion that US deaths could peak in less than a month will have two possible impacts. First, a sudden surge in deaths risks overwhelming health care systems that are currently struggling to prepare for cases needing intensive care. Secondly and conversely, it could support calls -- echoed by President Trump -- to reduce restrictions on movement in the coming weeks.  Longini said: "I would guess the US will hit a peak in deaths in the next two-three weeks, as the doubling time seems to be about two-three days." He added: "Maybe a partial lifting of the shelter-in-place for those less vulnerable may make some sense, in about three weeks. By then, much of the damage will have been done."  Asked if there could be a risk of a relapse when the virus circulated again in the following weeks, he said: "If it were limited, and we continued to protect the most vulnerable, that may be acceptable for now. Also, let's see what happens in the next two-three weeks. We can also keep an eye on China as they begin to relax restrictions there."  Two experts agree  The two other experts who broadly agreed with Longini offered slight variations on his projection, and both noted that the outbreaks are hitting each US community in a different way  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said the peak might take three more weeks.  "My notions are harmonious in that I also anticipate ... (the next) three to six weeks will be critical here in the United States," he said. He added it might take six weeks as the US is a "very diverse country with a hot spot in New York right now and warm spots. The rest of the country is warming up. In the next three to six weeks, all those areas will start to surge or will have their curve depressed or blunted by the social distancing that's going on. The virus will tell us."  He said he was more skeptical about the United States being able to lift restrictions on only part of the population. "Asking a subset to remain sheltered in place, to remain in home, that's more difficult to do," he said by phone.  A second expert agreed broadly. Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said by email: "I agree that by 3 weeks, we will have a better idea of what is going to happen going forward. The outbreaks seem to be hitting different communities at different times and at different intensities, so it is hard to generalize However, I agree in general. And that is why action now in terms of social distancing is so important."  Epidemiology has informed US, UK and other government policy as it provides informed guesses as to where and how fast infections are spreading. A recent sharpening of US and UK restrictions was, for example, based on modeling from the UK's Imperial College, which significantly worsened its prediction of how many people would require intensive care in hospital, using data from Italy.  Peak is 'impossible to predict,' another expert says  One disease modeler said it was "impossible to predict" when the peak would hit.  Dr. Stefan Flasche, a disease modeler at The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told CNN by email the peak was influenced by the efficiency of lockdown measures, and "may be anywhere between some time very soon and not for another few months."  "One scenario is we can indeed reverse the spread as done in China and South Korea, then reach a point to lift the distancing measures," Flasche said. "But (we may) have to repeat this cycle for a few times because of an inevitable resurgence of cases in the absence of population immunity. In that scenario, we would see multiple peaks in the upcoming 12 months."  President Donald Trump has said his desire to lift measures as quickly as possible is motivated by a desire to get the American economy moving again. He has expressed a belief that the economy could experience a "v" shaped, ultra-fast recovery. Yet one economist expressed doubt recovery could be that fast-paced and warned that snapping back in and out of restrictions could cause greater damage.  Erin Strumpf, a professor of economics at McGill University, told CNN: "Nothing suggests that we could just 'snap back' to life as it was before. We're taking concrete actions to lower the probability of an uncertain outcome."  She cautioned that it's hard to put a price on the uncertainty -- and deaths -- that might occur were the government to begin loosening restrictions. "Markets, investors, and economies don't do well in the context of panic and uncertainty," she said. "The people that are going to be dying from coronavirus are going to be very visible. We are going to know exactly who those people are. That changes the discussion a lot."
2020-03-25	(CNN) "This is not a moment of celebration -- but of necessity," US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said as the White House and Senate lawmakers reached a historic $2-trillion stimulus deal early this morning, amid growing coronavirus fears. The Senate will reconvene at noon to vote on the plan. Wall Street surged, Asian markets rallied and US stock futures pared losses on the news .  Democrats, including NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, have slammed President Donald Trump for his bid to reopen the nation's economy by Easter in order to spare business , despite health experts' warnings. "If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest," Cuomo said.  Countries the world over are grappling with how best to prioritize human life, while balancing economic losses. Announcing a 21-day nationwide lockdown of the world's fifth-biggest economy yesterday , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: "We will have to pay [the] economic cost of this, but to save every family member, this is the responsibility of everyone."  The disease is hitting all sections of society. Today, British royal officials announced that the heir to the throne, 71-year-old Prince Charles has tested positive for coronavirus . "He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual," a Clarence House statement said. He last saw Queen Elizabeth II on March 12.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  US could become global epicenter  New York has been hit hard, but other states are suffering too. In recent days, the numbers in Louisiana, New Jersey and elsewhere have also been skyrocketing . California has warned it could be the next to face a spike.  Test, test, test  A coronavirus test can be developed in 24 hours. So why are some countries still struggling to diagnose? One German scientist created a coronavirus test in January to give countries outside China a head start on the battle against the virus. Three months later, many have squandered that opportunity, reports Julia Hollingsworth  The German government was slow to take vital action, such as reducing social contact, and now has more than 29,000 confirmed cases. Yet even with similar numbers of infected patients as, for example, France, Spain and the US, the German mortality rate is much lower — about 0.4%. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist, breaks down what Germans are doing right  And, as scientists try to break down data on deaths, another finding: coronavirus may be killing more men than women. Why? Researchers say it could be down to smoking, drinking and general poor health. While insights like these are crucial to how we fight the virus, the US is not releasing the basic nationwide data needed to understand who is most vulnerable, according to a CNN analysis  Stop having coronavirus parties  A group of young adults held a "coronavirus party" in Kentucky to defy orders to socially distance. Now one of them has the disease . It's a clear signal that no one is invincible. While Covid-19 has been more deadly for older people, and those with underlying health issues, officials are imploring everyone to practice social distancing, as asymptomatic carriers of the virus can contribute to its swift, silent spread.  Presidents downplay virus warnings  Brazilians have been tricked by the media over a "little flu," according to President Jair Bolsonaro. Families should still go out to eat despite coronavirus fears, says Mexico's President Andres Manuél Lopez Obrador.

2020-03-25	An Alaska Airlines Airbus 320 takes off from Los Angeles International Airport on February 6, 2020. Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images  Alaska Airlines – which is based in Seattle and primarily serves the Pacific Northwest – is announcing it will cut its flight schedule by 70% for at least the next two months.  In a statement, the company says demand for its flights has fallen by more than 80%, forcing dramatic reductions.  Alaska Airlines says it is cutting contract and temporary jobs and suspending annual pay increases. The airline also is offering employees the opportunity to take a voluntarily leave of absence. Those who accept would not be paid a salary, but would keep their health and travel benefits.  Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden will forgo his pay through September 30, as will president Ben Minicucci, according to the airline. Additional pay cuts will be made in the executive ranks — all the way down to vice president level — and the board of directors will receive no pay.  The moves are being made as the company actively lobbies the federal government to pass a relief package for the airline industry.
2020-03-25	New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump, fearing an economic catastrophe ahead of the November election, is hoping to swiftly remove the severe health restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. But opening America for business in a few weeks could have the opposite effect: It could lay the groundwork for a repeat of the Great Depression.  Trump said Tuesday he wants the United States "opened up and raring to go by Easter."  The goal would be to ease the debilitating financial pain caused by the unprecedented shutdown of large swaths of the nation's economy. Unemployment claims are spiking . The stock market has cratered. And gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the economy -- will probably suffer an historic collapse.  But there are massive risks involved with quickly reversing the social distancing policies. Not only would a premature re-opening of the economy defy the advice of health experts, but economists warn it would backfire.  If you reopen the economy prior to the termination of the virus, you're creating a better probability of second and third waves that shut the economy again."  Instead of a one-time blow, the economy could face repeated shutdowns over a prolonged period.  "If the president decides to go 180 on us and open by Easter, that will create chaos and confusion. That is the prescription for a depression," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNN Business.  The goal of the health restrictions is to slow the outbreak, buying precious time to prevent the nation's hospitals and doctors from becoming completely overwhelmed.  "If people are panicked because hospitals are overflowing and loved ones are dying, the hit to the economy will be even worse than if we remain in lockdown," said Zandi, who advised Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008. "It's a massive gamble -- and one without science on his side."  Bernanke warns against rushing back to work  Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman credited with rescuing the American economy from the 2008 crisis, issued a similar warning Wednesday.  "It's important that before we put everyone back to work, we have the public health situation under control," Bernanke said on CNBC  Bernanke, who studied the Great Depression, said the current situation is "more like a major snowstorm or natural disaster than a Great Depression-style downturn."  But in this case, it's a snowstorm being intentionally brought on by governments desperately trying to prevent the spread of the virus.  "We're at a Volcker moment," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, referring to former Fed chief Paul Volcker's painful decision in the late 1970 and early 1980s to put the United States into a recession to tame runaway inflation.  "The federal government is slowing the economy down to try to terminate the virus. It's a conscious policy choice," Brusuelas said.  Morgan Stanley: Unemployment could spike to 12%  Conscious or not, the pain is severe for both Wall Street and Main Street.  Unemployment benefits spiked 33% last week, the sharpest increase since 1992 . Goldman Sachs predicted that figure will spike eightfold this week to a record 2.25 million.  The US unemployment rate will climb rapidly from current levels of 3.5% . Morgan Stanley sees unemployment averaging a record 12.8% in the second quarter.  And economists are bracing for an historic collapse in GDP. Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will contract at a 24% annualized rate in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley sees a record-breaking drop of 30.1%.  Sniffing out the looming recession, the stock market has gotten crushed. The S&P 500 has lost a quarter of its value, ending the longest bull market in American history.  Washington wasted little time mounting a powerful response.  The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero, promised to buy an unlimited amount of bonds (infinite QE) and is working overtime to unfreeze the financial pipelines in a bid to prevent a financial crisis.  Congress and the White House reached a deal on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package early Wednesday that provides relief for households, small businesses and lifelines for major corporations.  Blankfein supports phased return to work  But the stimulus won't erase the economic fallout. Moody's still expects second-quarter GDP to plunge by 17.6%, compared with 28.3% without stimulus.  Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that efforts to flatten the virus curve are "sensible," but have a real cost, too.  "Crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue - and beyond," Blankfein tweeted on Tuesday. "Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work."  Zandi urged US officials to study what happened in Asia, where China, South Korea and Singapore imposed very restrictive lockdowns.  "They're on the other side of this. While they are still battling the virus, their economies are coming back to life," Zandi said.  Yet Beijing is also discovering that it is difficult to persuade companies to get back to normal. And there is a risk that rushing that return to normalcy could spark a second wave of coronavirus in China.  Better off with one-time hit  With the presidential election barely five months away, Trump is clearly getting anxious to lift the health restrictions and revive the economy.  "Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly," the president tweeted on Tuesday. "THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!"  Of course, Trump would not be able to singlehandedly bring the economy back to life.  Various mayors and governors would likely keep their shutdowns in place, especially in hard-hit areas such as New York, New Jersey and San Francisco.  And countless CEOs would chart their own course, keeping their offices and factories dark to protect workers and morale.  Still, lifting federal restrictions would re-open parts of the economy, despite pleas from health officials not to do so.  "One can't help but think this is just a naked expression of the president's own narrow electoral interests," RSM's Brusuelas said.  But Brusuelas urged Trump to put the national interests ahead of his own political ambitions.  "If you reopen the economy prior to the termination of the virus, you're creating a better probability of second and third waves that shut the economy again," he said. "The US is better off taking a one-time hit."
2020-03-26	Although the United States government is making every effort to provide necessary supplies in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, supplies will only help so much, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said at a town hall for the American Society of Anesthesiologists on Thursday.  “We will not supply our way out of this problem,” he said.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided 9 million N95 respirators from the Strategic National Stockpile, and it has worked with manufacturers to increase production of N95 respirators to 100 million a month, according to Adams.  He also said the national stockpile purchases 0.1% of all national supplies, while the remaining 99.9% are utilized by commercial and private markets.  “A lot of the capacity that folks are looking for is already out there. It’s sitting on shelves in surgery centers. It’s sitting in hospitals. It’s just misaligned,” Adams said. “I really want you all to think about how you can help us fix that misalignment.”  Other ways to increase supplies are elimination of elective surgeries and converting anesthesia ventilators to ICU ventilators, according to Adams.  He also talked about the importance of testing. “By this time next week, we expect to be close to two million tests,” he said.  Other than provision of medical supplies to areas that need them most, Adams reiterated the importance of the general public taking social distancing and good hygiene practices seriously. According to Adams, the disease runs its course about six to eight weeks after strict social distancing, as seen in China and other parts of Asia.  By decreasing the number of infected people, he explained, the demand for supplies would also decrease. “The way we get out of this crisis is to lower demand,” he said.

2020-03-26	How do you choose between saving lives and saving the economy? CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans talks to investor Bill Ackman, and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta consults with bioethicist Arthur Caplan about some of the tough issues we're facing during this pandemic.  You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below:  CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans: We have never pushed this much money out the door, a big $2 trillion package. It shows that both parties are willing to spend some money to prevent the economy from falling off a cliff.  President Trump: America will again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than the three or four months that somebody was suggesting.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo: It's a false choice to say public health or restart the economy. You cannot put a value on a human life.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: We've seen wild swings in the stock market over the past few weeks. The S&P dropped to its lowest level in over three years this week, unemployment rates are soaring and a global recession is now expected this year. But lawmakers in Washington have reached an agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus package.  At the same time, doctors around the world are scrambling to address the Covid-19 outbreak and facing some difficult decisions about how to best care for their patients.  On today's episode, we're looking at what happens when we're presented with the choice of saving lives or saving the economy.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is "Coronavirus, Fact vs. Fiction."  Dr. Gupta: My specialty is medicine, not the economy. So for part of this episode, I want to hand things over to CNN's Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans.  She is our resident explainer-in-chief of all things money. Christine spoke with billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who recently made headlines with his radical proposal to save the US economy.  Bill Ackman, founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management: What I'm proposing is a 30-day lockdown of the entire country, a coordinated 50-state lockdown. I call it the "rip the Band-Aid off" strategy.  Christine Romans: Why do you think that's the best option to rescue the economy?  Ackman: The interests of the economy and the interests of the health care system are really identical here. The economy will recover quickly if we can shut down the virus. And the way to shut down the virus is the ultimate in social distancing, i.e. a total country shutdown.  And what I mean by shutdown or lockdown is basically what they're doing in New York state right now, but on a national basis -- which means all essential services, obviously health care, infrastructure, transportation, food, agriculture, you know, things that you need, you know, people need to eat, people need to be taken care of, etc. Those things continue. But everything else, you know, is a work-from-home mode. That's basically what they did in Wuhan, that's what we need to do in the United States. That's what they're doing in the UK. That's what they announced in India.  Romans: You know, the President himself said he doesn't want the cure to be worse than the problem. Do we risk dragging this out and really crushing capitalism if we can't fix it now and then move on and have it behind us?  Ackman: Yes. So the President is right in the sense that you don't want the cure to be worse than the problem. The problem is that the President, by not instituting a lockdown and trying to reopen the country early, when you've only had kind of a rolling series of partial lockdowns in maybe a dozen states, is that the virus will be completely out of control.  And instead of using the next week of this 15 days to squelch the virus and do it for real. If instead you said, look, we're gonna rip the Band-Aid off to take the hard step of locking down the entire country at once. By the way, we're going to do it for 30 days and then we've got to carefully reopen parts of the economy.  We're going to have to maintain social distancing. We're going to have to you know, people are gonna have to wear masks. People are going to have to be careful. But we start to begin the recovery. And with the beginning of the recovery, you'll see a massive recovery in the stock market that will help to build confidence.  You know, business fundamentally is a confidence game. And what's happened in the last period here is there's been a dramatic loss in confidence. If you look at the Chinese economy, what's interesting is the stock market in China began to fall as the virus number of cases went to skyrocket.  So if you look at the chart and the case level is skyrocketing up to into the sky and the market's plunging into the into the floor, if you will. And then as the cases begin to slow and eventually they almost capped the number of cases, the stock market began to soar again. And the stock market is sort of the best weather vane on how the economy's gonna do three, six months from now.  Romans: How much of a recovery bet are you making on the economy?  Ackman: We've invested about two and a half billion dollars of our investors' assets in stocks in the last ten days. We've been aggressively buying stocks that have been marked down. Prices are down 30%, 40%, 50% or more. So we've been, you know, betting that the economy is going to recover from here.  Dr. Gupta: That was Bill Ackman -- the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management.  The economy is also top of mind for New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo: This is unsustainable that we close down the economy and we continue to spend money. There is no doubt about that, no one is going to argue about that. But if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest. No American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life. Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.  Dr. Gupta: He went on to say ...  Cuomo: My mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters are not expendable.  Dr. Gupta: Gov. Cuomo's remarks got me thinking about medical ethics and some of the tricky hypotheticals we talked about in medical school ... Now, some doctors are having to make those hard choices in real life.  For more on this, I turned to a friend, and an expert: CNN Medical Analyst Arthur Caplan. He's also the director of the medical ethics division at NYU's Langone Medical Center. I asked him how you really can put a value on a human life.  Art Caplan: If everybody gets an equal opportunity to be considered, people understand that not everyone can live. They don't want to see bias. They don't want to see discrimination. Everybody wants to get a chance. Americans will accept rationing if they think the system is fair. That's what I've learned.  Dr. Gupta: The issue that I think a lot of people are starting to ask about is, is this an either-or conversation? Is there either economic damage or health damage?  Caplan: We can't just say we're going to be in isolation and distancing and quarantining for the next two weeks, and then we've got to come out because we've got to fix the economy. I don't think that's realistic and I don't think it's the right thing to do. It's not because I think you've got to put lives ahead of money, because I understand those who say the economy being in the tank also can cost lives.  There can be starvation. There can be crime. It can be a lot of ways in which people may die because the economy isn't functioning. But we've got to maintain the only weapon we've got right now, which is the social isolation and the distancing. I don't even think you can restore the economy in the middle of a pandemic.  You know, putting it crudely. There'll be so many people surging and dying and trying to get into the hospital system that you'd break it. You can't run the economy with no health care system because you've overwhelmed it. And that would happen if we stop being prudent and stop trying to isolate too soon.  If we want to get the economy started, the best thing the federal government can do is give us testing. Then you can start to isolate and quarantine the infected, and then you can probably start to let some people go back out to work. And by the way, that's the lesson from South Korea. It seems to me how they've gotten through this and are starting to open up. China's lesson was severe quarantine really enforced, if you will, at the point of a gun. We've not been willing to do that. But South Korea seemed to have plenty of testing, and they knew who to isolate. And I think that's why those two places are coming back more quickly.  Gupta: One of the things that sort of struck me was this this comment that I heard about these families that are really suffering economically, and the concern that their quality of life has greatly diminished and that there's maybe increasing suicide rates and things like that. It becomes a little a little blurry there. Right? It's not just about the economy in that situation.  Caplan: Well, I think that's right. There are public health consequences to isolating everyone for weeks. Domestic violence, suicide. Let's not forget that there are many people lonely. I can imagine other people who are impaired with cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's, strokes. What are they experiencing? What is it like? So I think this is a time where Americans do have to look out for one another. Call one another. Contact one another. It wouldn't even bother me if they went over to the yard and waved at one another. I think those kinds of supports are crucial to getting us through this impossibly difficult, but nonetheless, something we have to endure, period.  Gupta: It's a good point. When you look at this overall plan over the next several weeks. In in the spirit of optimism, do you see the light at the end of the tunnel, as has been described? You do have a timetable that you think this is going to take?  Caplan: Well, I have some optimism that not next week and not next month, but within the next six months, I think we'll start to see some drugs appear that do have a beneficial impact, at least in maybe attenuating, tamping down the nastiness of the disease, maybe shifting it from death sentence to survivability.  Again, it's optimistic, but there are so many teams working diligently out there. If we do this rapid testing and rapid clinical trial design that's in place, that's starting to move through our system, and indeed worldwide, I think we have the brainpower to come up with something.  Dr. Gupta: We don't yet know the lasting economic effect of the Covid-19 pandemic -- but I can tell this isn't really an either/or conversation. We know we're going to see an impact on the economy and also a loss of human life. As doctors, we take an oath to protect human life to the best of our ability.  Not only do we need to get people healthy first before we can rebuild the economy, we have to. One can't happen without the other.  A lot of people are going to be exposed to this virus, but we need to focus on slowing the pace of exposure so hospitals are not overrun. Now is not the time to pull back on social distancing efforts. We finally have some evidence that they're starting to work. For the short run at least, we need to prioritize public health and try to get this situation under control.  This isn't gong to last forever. When you look at China and South Korea and look at their timetable, it was around 8-10 weeks. Now it might be different here in the united states, but it's clearly not gonna be forever.  And don't forget, as I've said, we're all in this together.  Never before have we been as dependent on one another as we are now. At least not in my lifetime.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.
2020-03-26	Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) On Thursday, we hit a grim watershed. The US overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. This is a dire crisis and an extraordinary failure of President Donald Trump. Americans are suffering and dying because the Trump administration failed to act quickly and decisively to prevent the virus' spread. The US has now seen about 1,195 deaths and the number is rising rapidly.  On Thursday, the US saw an increase of more than 15,000 cases in one day -- a shocking surge that can be explained by both the spread of the virus and increased testing after weeks of shortages -- pushing the total number of confirmed cases over 82,000 . China, in comparison, has reported 81,285 cases.  There is a fundamental difference between China and the US. China has broken the spread of the virus with a lockdown that first started in Wuhan on January 23 and is now being lifted in stages; only a few dozen new cases are allegedly confirmed each day, and most of these are apparently introduced from abroad. The US has not broken the epidemic. And if Trump has his way, easing guidelines to stay at home by Easter , we will fail to stop the epidemic and millions more will be infected. Even with active control, we might be facing around 81,000 deaths by July according to a new detailed analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.  The transfer of the virus, which may have originated in bats , to humans was an unforeseen event. The response to that event has been determined by the policies of nations. On December 31, the Wuhan government publicly confirmed it was treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new pneumonia outbreak and on January 7 , officials identified a new coronavirus as the cause. The first confirmed case in Japan was identified in mid-January, with South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and the US following suit within days.  The East Asian countries went into action. Many had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak and had public health teams on alert for new epidemics. More than two months later, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed in the US, with more than 250 cases per million people, far higher than China, which has approximately 57 cases per million; Hong Kong, 60; Taiwan, 11; Singapore, 117; Japan, 11; and Korea, 180.

2020-03-26	(CNN) — As China slowly eases lockdown restrictions and life returns to somewhat normal conditions, residents have once again started traveling.  From the Bund waterfront in Shanghai to scenic Huangshan Mountain park in the eastern Anhui province, major landmarks across the country welcomed thousands of visitors over the weekend.  But an uptick in domestic sight-seeing doesn't necessarily mean international travel will rebound as quickly.  At least, not according to a recent study conducted by the Trip.com Group, China's largest online travel agency.  Related content Chinese tourist sites packed as country comes out of lockdown, but experts say risk still high  Based on a survey of 15,000 people across 100 cities in China at the end of March, the company found that 16% of respondents will be ready to travel again in May in time for Golden Week, a five-day public holiday.  However, the vast majority -- to the tune of 90% -- would prefer to travel domestically, with destinations like Yunnan, Hainan island and Shanghai sweeping the top three preferences.  "China is recovering well. Wuhan's lockdown will be lifted and at the same time, everyone around the world is fighting against Covid-19," Jane Sun, the CEO of Trip.com Group, tells CNN Travel.  "With the national holiday, we feel that May is a good time for travelers to go domestic since many countries have closed off their borders."

Many travel agencies, hotels, shops and guides around the world have come to rely on Chinese travelers, who comprise the world's largest outbound tourism market when it comes to trips and spending.  In 2018 alone, Chinese travelers took roughly 150 million outbound trips and collectively spent more than $277 billion.  "In 2001, Chinese residents made 10.5 million foreign trips. By 2018, that number rose by an astonishing 1,326%. For some countries, China is now the top inbound source of travelers," adds Sun.  "Domestic travel is the first step toward recovery. We remain optimistic about the future."  China's domestic recovery  An aerial photo, taken on April 7, shows bullet trains lined up at a station in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. STR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images  With many Chinese New Year plans cut short by the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, embarking on a post-Covid-19 adventure has certainly been on the minds of many Chinese residents.  And for some, that initial trip is just around the corner. According to Trip.com, roughly 61% of Chinese travelers surveyed indicated that they would feel ready to travel again by August.  A smaller-scale survey of 1,000 people across the country conducted by international management consulting firm Oliver Wyman supports these findings, while also exploring the rationale for staying close to home.  Roughly 77% of those surveyed said they would prefer a domestic destination for their first post-epidemic trip, citing "the severe virus situation overseas" as one of the main considerations when choosing a destination.  "From our survey, it is encouraging to see that the majority of Chinese travelers have a strong appetite to resume traveling and retail spending after Covid-19 subsides," Katie Sham, a principal of Oliver Wyman based in Shanghai, tells CNN Travel.  "The major reason that Chinese travelers want to explore domestically is that China is in a much more stabilized condition versus the rest of the world, at least in the coming three to four months."  Adventures at home  In the 1980s, Dong Yao-hui was part of the first three-man team to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall. Today, he's focused on its preservation.  As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps through regions like the US, UK and Europe and international air travel has slowed to a near standstill, it's hardly surprising that many Chinese travelers would prefer to explore at home, where new domestic infections have dropped dramatically.  What's more, there's no shortage of things to see and do across the vast nation.  "Within China, cities are popular and China is home to many UNESCO sites, so there remains lots to discover," says Sun.  Across the country, China counts 55 UNESCO World Heritage Sites as well as countless natural wonders , like Zhangjiajie's "floating" peaks, the karst scenery of the Li River outside of Guilin and Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan.  As Covid-19 restrictions ease, many of the country's most famous tourist attractions are slowly reopening, including the Badaling section of the Great Wall of China and the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.  Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group “Domestic travel is the first step toward recovery. We remain optimistic about the future.”  "Chinese people are curious and passionate about exploring their country and seeing different provinces, cities and landmarks," Holger Jakobs, vice president of sales and marketing of Wharf Hotels, tells CNN Travel.  "There is an extensive list of destinations which many younger people haven't seen. As international travel became easier, they were focused on quick trips to Hong Kong and Taiwan and Southeast Asia. But now I think there will be a big resurgence of classic destinations in China that were always there but were in the background for some travelers."  Wharf Hotels operates 10 properties in China, providing a solid overview of how the travel market is recovering.  "I think the (Trip.com) survey is spot on. We have actually already seen a rebound in domestic travel -- including leisure and nonessential business travel, corporate meetings and events -- at our properties in areas that were not as affected as central China," says Jakobs.  "In particular, we have seen recent upticks in Chongqing and Chengdu. These cities were already major drawing cards for shorter domestic travel, so these hotels are leading the recovery at the moment across our portfolio."  Shifts in travel style  As China emerges after months of lockdown, people are back on city streets and crowds flocking to popular destinations. CNN's David Culver reports on the cautious optimism officials are warning.  When it comes to the needs and preferences of Chinese travelers, it won't be business as usual -- at least not at first.  Both the Trip.com and Oliver Wyman surveys found that concerns about safety and ease of travel are top of mind.  "Chinese travelers want to feel safe and virus-free at each touchpoint along the journey," says Sham.  "They want to make sure that the hotels and the restaurants they choose are frequently sanitized, with hygiene being the top priority of the staff."  In addition, many travelers will prefer easy, short trips that are not too far away to test things out. The idea being, that if they encounter any problems, they can easily return home.  Jakobs agrees.  "What we've seen with our hotels is that flexibility is essential," he says.  "We are seeing a resurgence of voucher bookings and buying -- meaning that you can buy a voucher for a few room nights and have full flexibility on when to use it in a given time frame, just in case something happens."  Travel modes will also shift as people adjust to travel post-Covid-19. According to the Trip.com survey, the most popular style of travel will be independent, self-guided trips and smaller group tours.  By contrast, travel styles that are considered unsafe -- such as large group tours or cruises -- may take more time to assuage virus-wary residents.  According to Oliver Wyman, 71% said they would avoid tour bus excursions and 55% would avoid cruises, due to perceived health risks.  What about overseas travel?  Airlines, train companies and transit systems are increasing their cleaning routines to keep people safe from coronavirus, but surfaces like subway poles and escalators can become contaminated quickly. Watch the latest videos on Covid-19.  While shorter domestic trips may kick start the travel resurgence in China, international travel is likely not too far behind.  Roughly 14% of Trip.com respondents noted interest in visiting European countries, although their plans will be dependent on safety and travel restrictions.  "Outbound travel will gradually pick up as soon as the pandemic is contained, borders are lifted and subsequent visas from respective embassies and consulates are made available," says Sun.  Indeed, a renewed desire to travel within China signals a return to the status quo, rather than a dramatic shift in travel habits.  Chinese travelers took over 6 billion trips domestically in 2019, compared with just 155 million outbound trips, based on figures from the China Tourism Academy.  "More than 90% of all Chinese travelers were already traveling domestically (before Covid-19), so if you ask a more or less representative sample of the Chinese population, that is what you will get," Wolfgang Georg Arlt, founder of COTRI, tells CNN Travel.  Related content Meet the man building a human zoo in China  "At COTRI, we are looking at the 10% of Chinese travelers with a passport who are traveling internationally, and how their travel behavior will change after the crisis is over," he adds. "I think this clientele will choose short domestic trips at first, as well as regional outbound trips."  When considering the first outbound journeys post-virus, Arlt predicts travelers will likely choose nearby destinations in Asia such as Thailand, South Korea and Vietnam.  "It depends on a few factors: which destination will let Chinese travelers in, which have shown empathy when Wuhan was the center of the crisis, and which destinations are not considered dangerous," he adds.
2020-03-27	Federal health officials on Friday green-lit a point-of-care coronavirus test that can provide results in less than 15 minutes, using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests.  Teased by Vice President Mike Pence in a Thursday press briefing, the new diagnostic could accelerate testing in the United States, allowing for rapid results in doctors’ offices. But shortages of critical equipment used to collect patient specimens, such as masks and swabs, could blunt its impact.  The US Food and Drug Administration authorized the test for emergency use, signaling that federal regulators were satisfied with the test’s validation data and believe its benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.  The test’s maker, Abbott, said it expects to deliver 50,000 tests per day beginning next week. The technology behind the test looks for genes that are present in the virus, similar to PCR tests already on the market.  The platform used to run the test weighs less than 7 pounds, according to Abbott, and could be deployed “where testing is needed most,” such as at coronavirus hotspots.  More on this: Last week, the FDA authorized another rapid test – one from molecular diagnostics company Cepheid, which provides results in about 45 minutes. Most laboratory tests for the coronavirus take anywhere from a few hours to days to receive results.  All FDA-authorized tests, however, require samples from patients – and health care facilities say they’re facing shortages of critical supplies needed to collect specimens.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued guidance allowing some patients to collect their own nasal swabs in health care facilities, which could reduce the amount of protective equipment needed for health care workers.  But some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have said that patients with coronavirus-like illness should stay home – saying that is “safer for the patients and health care workers” and doesn’t change the treatment patients receive.
2020-03-27	London (CNN Business) For people living in South Korea, emergency texts from officials now come about three to five times a day.  They detail the exact locations and movements of people who have tested positive with novel coronavirus. Or they issue regular reminders and instructions on how to prevent the disease from spreading.  One district sent out a message on February 25 detailing a person's movements four days previously, down to the specific hours they were at an elementary school, town center and grocery store.  Another from the Central Disaster Relief Headquarters on March 26 gave what has become for South Koreans a near daily instruction on social distancing, hand washing, coughing etiquette, and how to care for seniors.  South Korea has apparently managed — for the time being — to "flatten the curve" and limit the spread of the virus. Experts attribute the recent decline in new cases in the country to its early testing efforts, contact tracing and surveillance.  South Korea's emergency alert system uses cell broadcasting, meaning that through technology installed within the mobile network, the government can blast out messages, reaching most people with a cell phone.  But the United Kingdom and other European countries lag behind places like South Korea on emergency text messages, a service experts in security and emergency preparedness believe could be vital in helping inform populations and control the virus.  So how do governments get messages directly to millions of people? Do they have everyone's number?  There are three main ways to get mass mobile messages to people, and in all of them, governments don't need direct access to every single number.  The government had to ask each mobile network operator to send out the alerts on their behalf, and as a result some people The first is through cell phone companies, which is how UK residents received an alert earlier this week about new stay at home rules.The government had to ask each mobile network operator to send out the alerts on their behalf, and as a result some people received the message hours after others.  Everbridge EVBG There are another two ways governments can blast out messages to all users without asking the network operators for permission, said Javier Colado, senior vice president of, a software company that provides governments and organizations tools to manage critical events.  Both require specific technology and hardware to be embedded within mobile networks, and operators can be compelled by governments to allow that.  The first option is the cell broadcast service used by South Korea and the United States where the government uses the network operators' cellular towers and radio cells to push out a message in a matter of seconds, without officials needing access to any specific information on SIM cards or phone numbers.  Though this system typically reaches more than 80% of the population (including people who have mobile data switched off), those with older phones or the cell broadcast feature somehow disabled may not receive the message.  The second option, called SMS location-based messaging, can target people based on a specific location, get more information on them and interact with them.  Governments can choose a specific area on a map and send a message to all cell phones active in that area. Though the messages don't go out as quickly as the cell broadcast service, Colado said, the upside is governments can ask people if they need help, or if they have symptoms of the disease.  Michael Hallowes, who previously lead the implementation of the emergency alert system in Australia as emergency commissioner for Victoria, told CNN Business that a SMS location-based service can be so finely tailored it could send messages to everyone crowding in a park, or just a single apartment block. If people need to disperse or be evacuated, the system could message all cell phones in the area, and be able to check on a heat map whether they complied.  The system in Australia, Hallowes said, has a 97% successful delivery rate, which Hallowes said is far above mass cell broadcasting or asking the operators to text their subscriber base.  These types of text messages work, said Dr. Fred Muench, president of the US-based Center on Addiction who has conducted extensive research on using digital messaging for public health.  "Overall, SMS campaigns for public health are the most effective medium for mass dissemination due to their reach, immediacy, opportunity for data collection and personalization, ability to tailor and adapt information, and opportunity to link to other sources," Muench told CNN Business. "We found that personalizing and adaptively tailoring text messages has the largest effects compared to other types of messages."  EU and UK lagging behind  is anonymized and data protection laws such as GDPR Hallowes, now managing director of Zefonar which advises governments on emergency alert systems, said personal information used for this purposeis anonymized and data protection laws such as GDPR contain specific caveats for processing of certain data for emergencies and public health issues like pandemics.  "The ability to remotely monitor and manage the human impacts of this coronavirus through data our mobile phones naturally generate and operator networks process lawfully everyday has got to be of great utility to protecting our key workers from having to encounter people in breach, as well was giving us the analysis in real time of how widespread the infection is," Hallowes said.  An EU directive passed in 2018 says that by June 2022, all member countries should have a mobile alert system in place that can warn citizens and visitors in a specific area about any local emergency.  recommending it, hence the need this week to ask the mobile network operators to send out a message on their behalf. In 2014, the United Kingdom tried out an emergency alert system, but it was never put into place despite a government report recommending it,hence the need this week to ask the mobile network operators to send out a message on their behalf.  Toby Harris, a Labour Party member of the House of Lords who has long advocated for emergency alert systems and resiliency planning, slammed the UK government for dragging its feet on a system he believes could "undoubtedly" save lives.  "This shilly shallying has been going on for the last six years. Now is the time to take action," Lord Harris told CNN Business. "What seems to have happened, they did some testing, and no one could agree which department should lead on it and which would pay for it and in the end nothing happened."  Colado said as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, several countries are just now ramping up efforts, reaching out to his company in recent weeks for help.  "It's a pity because the reality today we face is a lot of countries coming to us asking what we can do quickly and these things don't get set up in 24 hours so we need more time," he said.  — Jake Kwan contributed to this report from South Korea.
2020-03-27	(CNN) President Donald Trump called into Sean Hannity's show on Fox News Thursday night -- and then spent more than 40 minutes talking about the coronavirus , China, governors he doesn't like and all sorts of other things.  Why was the President spending so much time griping on the phone with one of his most ardent defenders even as the United States became the country with the most documented coronavirus cases in the world? I have no idea -- but I did go through the interview and pick out the lines you need to see.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  1. Well, because of you, I made it to 10:30. So, that shows the power of ... That shows you have the number one rated show on television."  In which the President of the United States says he postponed a phone call with the Chinese President so he could appear on Hannity's TV show. And away we go!  2. "We had 20 people in the office, 21 to be exact. And we had a lot of experts. And they never really thought to do that."  Trump is explaining his decision to ban travelers from China entering the US here. And making sure it's clear that despite "a lot of experts" being in the room, they never thought of doing that. It was him who thought of it.  3. "A lot of the people decided to go to Italy instead. They went to Spain instead. And you see the problems they're having."  To be clear, what Trump is suggesting here is that because he banned travelers from China coming into the US, those Chinese travelers instead went to Italy and Spain -- which is why those countries are having such bad coronavirus outbreaks. What evidence did he offer for such a claim? Oh, none.  4. "I had Biden calling me xenophobic. And yet he can't define the word. If you ask him, what does it mean? I'm sure he couldn't tell you what it means."  [narrator voice] Joe Biden knows what "xenophobic" means.  5. "If you were a betting man, I guess you'd have to bet against it. But a lot of people are saying this could be a big answer."  This is classic Trump. He's talking about the use of anti-malarial drugs in a trial to see if they work against the coronavirus -- an effort he pushed heavily. If it works, he'll take all the credit. But if it doesn't, he'll point to the "lot of people" who were saying it "could be a big answer."  6. "Now, the vaccine is going really well. But for the vaccine, you need about a year, at least a year of testing because, you know, you can't put things into somebody's body by the thousands and then if it's dangerous."  "I've heard very quick numbers — a matter of months — and I've heard pretty much a year would be an outside number." -- Trump on a coronavirus vaccine, March 2  7. "So that's, you know, they -- they acted very, very late. They were incredibly late and the news, the media, I won't be a wise guy on your show and call it what a lot of people know it is. It's so unfair. It's so unfair."  Trump hates to be blamed or criticized and, when he is, tries to change the subject by blaming someone else. So, for those who have criticized his handling of the coronavirus, he seeks to note how many people died from the swine flu late last decade. Because that was when Barack Obama was president. The problem with the comparison is, well, there are lots of problems. One big one? Trump is totaling all suspected swine flu deaths through the life of H1N1 and comparing that to the current stats on coronavirus, which, unfortunately, is nowhere near its end. Read this from The Wahington Post's Philip Bump  8. "You look at the Gallup polls and all the different polls that are coming out, we're really being given good marks for what's happening."  This is, broadly speaking, true  9. "Now, I think that we inherited a broken system from the previous administrations, not just one. And it was very broken."  For Trump, it's always someone else's fault. Always.  10. "It's -- it's incredibly powerful -- I mean, you can do almost anything as president. You can demand that they give you whatever you want, I mean all of these things. It's a powerful tool.  This is Trump on the Defense Production Act . And yes, saying "you can do almost anything as president" is slightly chilling.  11. "So I haven't had to use it because like we had Ford step up, General Motors step up, 3M step up."  12. "And you know, they'd say, like Gov. (Andrew) Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them, 30,000. All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers."  No big deal! Just the President of the United States suggesting that the governor of New York is lying about the number of ventilators he needs to help keep people alive! What proof did Trump offer to back up this claim? Um, none.  13. "Gov. (Jay) Inslee, that's the state of Washington. He was a failed presidential candidate. And you know, he's always complaining."  What relevance does the fact that the governor of Washington ran unsuccessfully for president have when it comes to how he is handling the coronavirus outbreak in his state? Oh, thanks for asking! It has no relevance.  14. "And your governor of Michigan, I mean, she's not stepping up. I don't know if she knows what's going on. But all she does is sit there and blame the federal government."  Ah yes. Trump suggesting a female Democratic governor -- her name is Gretchen Whitmer, by the way -- doesn't know what's going on. Normal stuff here!  15. "And you know, you look around and you see what's going on."  So, so true.  16. "The governor, he's a -- and he ran for president, didn't exactly do well. He got zero."  Uh, relevance, your honor?  17. "And we've had a big problem with the young, a woman governor from, you know who I'm talking about, from Michigan."  OK, so now Whitmer is "young" too. (She's 48.) This isn't condescending or sexist. Not at all!  18. "And you know a lot -- a lot of equipment's being asked for that I don't think they'll need but I'm building."  Again here Trump is suggesting that governors are being greedy -- using the coronavirus crisis to force the federal government to give them medical supplies they don't need. What evidence does he have for making these claims? You already know the answer to that one.  19. "In all cases, we intend on getting the money back, getting interest, and in many cases, some cases, issuing what they call warrants. We'll get pieces of the company, large pieces of the company."  Trump seems to suggest here that in exchange for the loans for business contained in the $2 trillion economic stimulus package , the government will take ownership -- at least part ownership -- of the companies. Which, uh, isn't really capitalism?  20. "In the case of Rand Paul, a good guy, by the way, he actually has this problem. And I'm sure he'll be all right."  Rand Paul spent almost a week around his Senate colleagues while awaiting the results of a coronavirus test. It came back positive.  21. "I don't understand Mitt Romney. I'm not a fan but, of course, I want him to get well, absolutely."  22. "And you take a look at some states, a big portion -- I mean, they all have a little bit, but many of them have just a little bit. And they have it under control, their incredible governors, their incredible senators. And they're watching it and they are very well-run. And they have it under control."  It may be true that states with low numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases have it "under control." It also may be true that they simply are behind the curve in terms of testing and so their cases will go up once there is adequate testing.  23. "But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be."  What is this "feeling" based on? He didn't say.  24. "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?"  This is Trump outright suggesting that governors are lying about their medical needs. It's a stunning accusation. For which the President offers no proof.  25. "And it was also if you had it, you had a very good percentage of not making it. You know, it was -- it was really something."  Trump on the Spanish Flu: "It was really something."  26. "We're -- we're testing -- we've tested now more than anybody."  Trump loves to note that the US has now tested more people that South Korea, which is widely regarded as having handled the coronavrius outbreak the best of any country in the world. The one problem with the comparison? The population of South Korea is 52 million. The population of the United States is almost 330 million.  27. "He's got a lot of ranting and raving and, you know, let's give everything away. But Bernie is not a bad debater."  Trump on Sen. Bernie Sanders: "He's got a lot of ranting and raving."  28. "Going last is much better because when you go first, and then they do it. So going last is much better."  (He's talking about when to hold the party's national convention.)  29. "But nevertheless, it got out there and I started calling it the Chinese virus. And everybody picked it up."  "And everybody picked it up." (Read this on that.)  30. "I don't like it, though, when some governors, I mean, I mentioned two of them but some of these governors, you know, they -- they take, take, take and then they complain. They take and you do a great job."  Trump always wants to be thanked. Profusely. For doing his job. This feels like a good place to end.
2020-03-27	New Delhi (CNN) Thousands of migrant workers are attempting to leave India's major cities after a government lockdown designed to prevent a local epidemic of novel coronavirus left them without jobs or pay.  The potential mass migration may undermine attempts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to prevent the localized spread of the coronavirus, with some workers even attempting to make the journey on foot, due to widespread closures of public transport.  According to government statistics, every year more than nine million migrant workers move from India's rural areas to large population centers to find work at construction sites or factories, sending money back to their home towns and villages.  But with those industries closed by the government lockdown, many have been left with little choice but to attempt the return journey home.  Migrant worker Bablu Ehrewal, 24, used to work at a mall construction site earning $7 a day (500 rupees). Construction stopped this week when the lockdown came into effect. Now he is stuck in a slum with 70 other migrant construction workers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and hasn't been paid in 20 days.  Read More
2020-03-28	Holland America's Zaandam cruise ship enters Panama Bay on Friday, March 27. Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images  The Zaandam cruise ship has been given permission to cross the Panama Canal and will then head toward Florida, according to a press release issued by the Panama Canal Saturday.  The green light comes a day after the Panama Canal said on Twitter the Zaandam would not be able to use the canal to get to Florida because the ship had passengers on board who tested positive for coronavirus.  Four "older" guests have died on the Zaandam and two others have tested positive for coronavirus. The cause and manner of death for the individuals who have died has not been determined yet. More than 130 others have displayed flu-like symptoms, according to the cruise line.  Panama’s Ministry of Health approved the passage of the Zaandam for “humanitarian reasons,” the release said.  "The Panama Canal supports all the efforts that are being made to make it easier for the passengers and crew of the Zaandam cruiser to reunite with their families," the Panama Canal said Saturday.  No passengers or crew members will be allowed to disembark on Panamanian territory, the statement said.  The ship was scheduled to cross the Panama Canal on April 1, but passage could happen earlier, according to the Panama Canal.  There are a total of 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam. The ship departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was scheduled to sail to Chile, but has been denied access to ports.
2020-03-28	Alice Driver is a freelance journalist whose work focuses on migration, human rights and gender equality. She is based in Mexico City. Driver is the author of " More or Less Dead: Feminicide, Haunting, and the Ethics of Representation in Mexico ." The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) When my plane landed in Mexico City from Mérida on March 15, I was on my way to my apartment to self-quarantine. The World Health Organization had declared coronavirus a global pandemic just days before -- and many countries were closing their borders to prevent its spread -- so it seemed like the responsible thing to do after traveling, even within Mexico.  But when I turned on my phone, I was flooded with messages and photos from friends enjoying the Vive Latino outdoor music festival among some 40,000 attendees . I was upset and worried, though not surprised because, at that point, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had not yet decided to cancel any large events in Mexico due to coronavirus.  As I passed through the Mexico City airport, I saw no signs that measures were being taken to screen passengers for fever. Again, while this disturbed me, it didn't shock me. López Obrador had followed in US President Donald Trump's footsteps in terms of initially downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus.  The Mexican President's poor leadership, which has been on display for weeks, has now placed Mexico in a precarious position -- with a looming health crisis and no clear plan in place to address it. As of now, the country has relatively few cases , especially compared to its neighbor to the north. But, according to Bloomberg, there are concerns over adequate testing, which means the reported numbers may conceal a much larger problem on the horizon.  For background, on March 4, López Obrador responded to news of the global spread of the coronavirus by telling Mexicans , "This idea that you can't hug. You have to hug. Nothing happens." Compounding the issue of his statements was the fact that López Obrador had made serious cuts to the very institutions that would be needed to respond to coronavirus. In 2019, as a part of austerity measures, his government cut funding to hospitals and medical centers by $120.7 million. This decision has contributed to the fear that doctors and nurses, who are working in understaffed hospitals without appropriate protective gear or supplies, are now experiencing.  Dr. Francisco Moreno, who is overseeing Covid-19 patients in one of Mexico City's hospitals, said in a recent interview with the New York Times, "You have all the facts to know that this is going to be as bad as Italy or worse." And, as a health crisis nears, many Mexican citizens question why López Obrador has ignored recommendations made by doctors and scientists.  Over the past few weeks, López Obrador has continued to hold political events around Mexico, and photos of him kissing and hugging children have gone viral on social media, as citizens and journalists questioned the example he was setting by seemingly not taking any safety precautions.  In response, López Obrador, seemingly defiant, posted videos of himself on Twitter, holding large events where he continued to hug and kiss supporters. He further declared, "I have faith that we will get our beloved Mexico through. Misfortunes, pandemics, nothing like that will do us any harm." On March 14, López Obrador reiterated his commitment to ignoring social distancing by posting on Twitter a video of himself at a political event hugging and kissing citizens in Guerrero.  Meanwhile, López Obrador, on March 22 said , "Let's continue living life normally." Then he added , "If you're able and have the means to do so, continue taking your family out to eat ... because that strengthens the economy."  Members of López Obrador's own administration have begun to challenge him publicly. At a press conference on March 26, López Obrador announced that by April 19 social distancing would end because the country would have "overcome the worst of Covid-19." The Minister of Health, Hugo López Gatell, who was sitting nearby, added, "more or less," which upset the President, who responded, "What did you say?"

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Despite the Mexican President's downplaying of the virus, other government officials are beginning to take steps to mitigate the threat of coronavirus. On March 24, Mexico's deputy health minister announced social distancing measures and, on March 25, the federal government announced that it would suspend all non-essential activities beginning Thursday. Meanwhile, Mexico's Public Education Secretary decided to close schools nationwide from March 20 through April 20.  And in a surprising twist, on Friday, López Obrador said that he had signed an order to give the Ministry of Health the means to acquire medical equipment to face the coronavirus pandemic.  Given Mexico's underfunded and understaffed medical system, the reported lack of coronavirus tests and the weeks the President spent encouraging citizens to act in defiance of social distancing, only time will tell the price that Mexican citizens will pay. But regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear -- López Obrador failed, at least initially, to uphold his duty to protect the Mexican people.
2020-03-29	Moscow (CNN) Russia under President Vladimir Putin has pioneered authoritarian tech: Last year, the Kremlin leader approved measures that would enable the creation of a "sovereign" Russian internet , able to be firewalled from the rest of the world.  The Covid-19 pandemic is now giving Russian authorities an opportunity to test new powers and technology, and the country's privacy and free-speech advocates worry the government is building sweeping new surveillance capabilities.  Perhaps the most well-publicized tech tool in Russia's arsenal for fighting coronavirus is Moscow's massive facial-recognition system. Rolled out earlier this year, the surveillance system had originally prompted an unusual public backlash, with privacy advocates filing lawsuits over unlawful surveillance.  Coronavirus, however, has given an unexpected public-relations boost to the system.  Last week, Moscow police claimed to have caught and fined 200 people who violated quarantine and self-isolation using facial recognition and a 170,000-camera system. According to a Russian media report some of the alleged violators who were fined had been outside for less than half a minute before they were picked up by a camera.  "We want there to be even more cameras so that that there is no dark corner or side street left," Oleg Baranov, Moscow's police chief, said in a recent briefing, adding that the service is currently working to install an additional 9,000 cameras.  In this photo taken on Feb. 22, a surveillance camera, top left, is seen as people walk down in a Moscow's Metro.  The system has also been used to analyze the social networks of those who have or are suspected of having coronavirus. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin described in his official blog how municipal authorities tracked a Chinese woman who flew to the city from Beijing back in February.  While a test eventually came back negative, Sobyanin said the authorities located the taxi driver who took the woman home from the airport, a friend she met outside her apartment block in violation of the quarantine, and collected data on all 600 people living in her building.  And then there's the use of geolocation to track coronavirus carriers. Epidemiologists see tracking and data-crunching as one important tool for tracking and localizing outbreaks, but Russia has taken a distinctive approach. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin earlier this week ordered Russia's Ministry of Communications to roll out a tracking system based on "the geolocation data from the mobile providers for a specific person" by the end of this week.  In other words, the data hoovered up by the system will not be anonymous: According to a description in the government decree, information gathered under the tracking system will be used to send texts to those who have come into contact with a coronavirus carrier, and to notify regional authorities so they can put individuals into quarantine.  Such measures have prompted little public debate. And Russia is far from being the only country in the world that increased surveillance capabilities to curb the spread of the virus.  A video surveillance camera is pictured at the Novomoskovsky multipurpose medical center for patients suspected of the coronavirus infection symptoms, in Moscow.  In Israel, the Shin Bet security service has shifted its powerful surveillance program to retrace the movements of coronavirus patients or suspected carriers. The mechanism is similar to that used in Russia -- phone and credit card data are used for mapping, and health officials must then alert and quarantine people who were within 2 meters, for 10 minutes or more, of someone infected with the virus, according to the country's Health Ministry.  The ministry said in a statement the information will only be used by its specialists and deleted after 60 days. But rights groups have filed a petition against it to the High Court of Justice, which warned it will shut the program down unless more oversight is in place. On Thursday, Shin Bet said in a statement that it helped the health authorities to identify and isolate more than 500 residents who were found to be sick with the coronavirus.  In South Korea, the government used data from credit card transactions, phone geolocation and surveillance footage to give detailed information on coronavirus patients, without identifying them by name, according to a government website. The result was a map where people can see if they were in close proximity to a coronavirus carrier. Detailed histories led to some patients being doxxed -- having their personal information outed without consent -- and authorities decided to scale down the data-sharing policies.  Mobile carriers in the European Union are sharing data with health authorities in Italy, Germany and Austria to help monitor how people comply with social distancing, Reuters reported. The US government is looking into using anonymous data gleaned by tech giants for similar purposes, according to The Washington Post. But in Russia, privacy advocates worry that the country's use of facial recognition had already been a legal gray zone; stricter measures amid coronavirus could allow the state to exert even more control over its citizens once the epidemic is over.  "The difference lies with the countries that have a higher culture of privacy and a significant limitation of access and use of this data," said Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with Roskomsvoboda, a non-government organization that tracks online freedoms in Russia. "The scariest thing is that the epidemic will end someday, but these measures I'm sure will stay."  Meanwhile, Russia plans to expand its existing systems as the number of coronavirus cases grows. But Moscow's system of Big Brother surveillance is far from perfect. Outside Russia's capital, facial recognition is usually limited to airports and railway stations, but the government says it is preparing to tap into other surveillance tools in an effort to further map out the virus patterns.
2020-03-29	The exterior of Elmhurst Hospital in Queens on Sunday, March 29. Mary Altaffer/AP  President Donald Trump described a grim scene of Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, including body bags and refrigerated trucks to take away bodies.  "I've been watching them bringing in trailer trucks. Freezer trucks. Freezer trucks, because they can’t handle the bodies because there are so many of them," Trump said.  Trump added that he has never seen anything like this in this country.  This is in my community in Queens, New York. I have seen things that I’ve never seen before. I mean I've seen them, but I’ve seen them on television and faraway lands, never in my country," Trump said. "When I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies, and these are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden. And they're pulling up to take out bodies and you look inside, and you see the black body bags and you say what is in there? (It's) Elmhurst Hospital, must be supplies. It is not supplies, it is people. I have never seen anything like it."  Trump also described body bags in hospital hallways, but CNN has seen no evidence that there are body bags in the hallways of the hospital. There are refrigerated trucks where hospital personnel have been putting bodies to alleviate the capacity of the regular morgue.
2020-03-30	Trump's extension of social distancing guidelines until April 30 is a highly significant move that means American life will remain shut down for at least a month, and probably longer.  Despite cascading humanitarian and political impacts of that decision, the devastating toll of the virus left Trump little choice -- even though some conservative backers have been urging him to ease lockdowns.  A President, who a month ago was predicting a miracle that would just make the virus go away, was presented with cataclysmic figures that 2.2 million Americans could die if he indulged his itch to start reopening the economy in the coming week  "Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won," Trump, who last week repeatedly suggested that win was near, said Sunday, extending restrictions due to expire on Monday for another month at least.  Trump's decision to listen to his advisers will relieve public health officials and emergency physicians countrywide and shows that he is, in extremis, willing to listen to science -- in a way that would be a given for most presidents but has not been so for a commander-in-chief who has so often blurred truth  The President appeared at a Sunday evening news briefing in which he rattled off multiple false statements , called corporate CEOs to the mic to praise his leadership and falsely and personally attacked journalists who asked him tough questions.  He also bizarrely appeared to accuse health workers of stealing surgical masks amid huge shortages brought on by terrible conditions in hospitals and accused states of "hoarding" ventilators. Trump also boasted about his own TV ratings.  His antics appeared especially questionable given the sobering apparent reality that tens of thousands of Americans will die in the coming weeks as the pandemic takes a terrible hold.  At a desperate moment in America's modern history, Trump appears to continue to be focused intently on his own political image, claiming personal credit and remaining highly sensitive to any form of criticism.  Trump's reversal appeared to be the latest occasion when his officials have brought flattery and the power of argument to bear to change his mind on leadership decisions that were apparently based on hunches and limited reasoning.  Trump concedes death toll could be 100,000 or more  Trump predicted the death rate in the US -- which doubled from Thursday to Sunday -- could peak within two weeks but the nation could get "to the bottom of the hill" by June 1.  Even that figure seems characteristically optimistic. "We should be so lucky," Rhode Island emergency physician Megan Ranney told CNN, pointing out that only even if social distancing were adopted nationwide now, two weeks was probably not sufficient for all of the most critical cases to emerge.  He had been desperate to start some county-by-county opening of the economy in the days to come. But the President's decision -- potentially a turning point in the nation's fight against the pandemic -- appears to have followed concerted lobbying by two top public health officials, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx.  "We showed him the data. He looked at the data and he got it right away," Fauci told CNN's John Berman on "New Day" Monday. "It was a pretty clear picture. Dr. Debbie Birx and I went in together in the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said, 'Here are the data. Take a look.' He looked at them, he understood them and he just shook his head and said, 'I guess we got to to do it.'"  Trump predicted his decision would save hundreds of thousands of lives, in an apparent moving of the political goalposts to account for the fast worsening US pandemic.  "2.2 million people would have died if we didn't do what we are doing," the President said.  "If we can hold that number down ... to 100,000, it's a horrible number, maybe even less ... we all, all together have done a very good job," Trump said.  The new April 30 date marks yet another reversal of position on the pandemic by the President, who last week made clear he did not pick the Easter date, April 12, based on data but because it was a "beautiful timeline." Shrugging off his row back, Trump claimed Sunday that Easter had only been an "aspirational date."  Almost no one, who closely followed the science, modeling and data -- including governors, health experts and commentators -- thought Trump's original timeline was smart.  Fauci explained Sunday that the US death toll, based on modeling, could reach 100,000 deaths or more , a comment first made on CNN.  "I think it's entirely conceivable that if we do not mitigate to the extent we are trying to do is that you could reach that number," Fauci said at the White House news conference.  He described Trump's decision as a wise and prudent one.  Earlier on Sunday, Trump's rationale for a county-by-county reopening of the economy was undercut by comments from his top official.  "I'm not against releasing the restrictions. I'm actually for it in an appropriate place. But I don't recommend it unless we have the tools in place in real time," Fauci said.  Birx also undermined the rationale for Trump's plan to put in place new recommendations for social distancing after options were presented to him during the weekend.  "We all are deeply concerned and why we've been raising the alert in all metro areas and in all states," Birx said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."  "No state, no metro area will be spared," Birx said. "At this moment, we are asking every single governor and every single mayor to prepare like New York is preparing now."  Birx also said Monday morning that rural communities in the US should prepare for the spread of Covid-19, "even though you think it's not there."  "This virus, we think, can spread with a lot of asymptomatic and mild cases. It's not until it gets into the vulnerable groups that you start to see the hospitalizations," Birx told NBC. "If you wait for that, if the metros and rural areas don't take care now, by the time you see it, it has penetrated your community pretty significantly. And that's what we're concerned about. And that's why you have to prepare, even though you think it's not there,"  Pelosi claims Trump 'fiddles' while people die  The darkening mood over the pandemic did not convince Trump to moderate his extreme political rhetoric.  On Sunday, two journalists, Yamiche Alcindor of the PBS NewsHour and CNN's Jeremy Diamond, read the President's own controversial comments back to him -- which he denied in real-time on television.  JUST WATCHED Trump spars with CNN reporter when confronted with past remarks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump spars with CNN reporter when confronted with past remarks 04:54  "We're getting the word out. We're getting the accurate word out," Trump told reporters.  In another example of the President being corrected, he said last week on Fox News that he just didn't believe calls for 30,000 new ventilators, apparently referring to warnings of a shortage of the life saving equipment from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Fauci effectively corrected Trump on Sunday.  "I tend to believe Governor Cuomo," Fauci told CNN.  "One way or the other, he needs the ventilators that he needs. And, hopefully, we will get him the ventilators that he needs."  The generational challenge of the coronavirus pandemic would have tested any administration. And any President would have racked up failures under such intense pressure.  But Trump's incessantly confusing positions, claims of huge personal success and willingness to politicize are raising scrutiny of his own administration's performance.  His litany of false statements and misleading statistics -- for instance his claim the US had tested far more people than South Korea -- even though on a per capita basis the US figure is far lower, also focus criticism on his handling of the situation.  The President again celebrating what he says is the low mortality rate in the US comes across as in poor taste when the death toll in the United States is soaring.  Trump is not the only senior political leader willing to inject explosive political language into the debate.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday highlighted Trump's initial handling of the epidemic in her own interview with CNN, which contained exceedingly strong language.  "The President, his denial at the beginning, was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where it -- it continues, his delay in getting equipment to where it's needed is deadly," Pelosi told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union."  "As the President fiddles, people are dying and we have to, we just have to take every precaution," Pelosi said.
2020-03-30	Two weeks after San Francisco issued the country’s first shelter in place order for residents to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus, hospital emergency rooms throughout the region appear to be seeing the early effects.  “The surge we have been anticipating has not yet come,” Dr. Jahan Fahimi, an emergency physician and medical director at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN. “We’re all kind of together holding our breaths.”  As of Monday morning, the city reported a total of 374 confirmed infections and six deaths from the virus. While the availability of testing is still much lower than officials would like, the modest daily count compared to other major urban centers may be an encouraging sign that the early aggressive action in the country’s second most densely populated city is having its intended effect.  “We have already made a difference in saving lives,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said during a news conference Monday, though she and other officials repeatedly cautioned that US communities are still in the early stages of the battle against the virus.  "We’re watching the data very carefully,” added Dr Grant Colfax, the city’s public health director, cautioning that the numbers could still explode rapidly.  The situation in Los Angeles: But that sense of hope has not necessarily reached Los Angeles County, where hospitals are seeing a steady increase in the number of patients.  Close to 2,500 people are confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus in the county, with 342 new cases reported in the past two days.  "Honestly, I would be very, very cautious because I really think we are at the beginning of the uptick,” Dr Armand Dorian, the chief medical officer at the University of Southern California Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale, said.  Across town at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, doctors expressed more optimism in the early efforts.  “We are cautiously hopeful that there has been a flattening of the steep curve because we have not seen the exponential rise of traffic coming in,” said Dr Anish Mahajan, the hospital’s chief medical officer, referring to the rate of new transmissions.  Harbor-UCLA has seen a steady rise in coronavirus patients in recent days, increasing from 12 patients on Thursday to 35 on Monday.  “And that may be because of the stay at home order,” Mahajan said. “But it’s far too premature to say because we have done such little testing.  What the authorities say: At a news conference Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked if officials were beginning to see a flattening of the curve of coronavirus patients.  “We’re in the middle of this. It would be too easy to say what has or has not worked,” Newsom said. “The stay home effort has bought us time to prepare.”  California currently has at least 5,763 coronavirus cases, including 118 deaths.
2020-03-30	Trump inaccurately characterized previous statements he has made downplaying the severity of the crisis. He again talked up medications that have not been clinically proven safe or effective for use against the coronavirus. Immediately after boasting about having superior knowledge of South Korea, he misstated the population of Seoul. And in touting progress on coronavirus testing, he omitted important context.  Here's a fact check of his statements from the briefing.  South Korea and coronavirus testing  Trump touted the number of coronavirus tests the US has conducted, saying "over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far." Later in the briefing, when asked when the US per capita number will be "on par" with the per capita number in other countries, Trump said, "It's very much on par." (He later added, "I didn't talk about per capita.")  Facts First: Trump was omitting important context. The US has conducted far fewer tests per capita than some other countries, such as Trump was omitting important context. The US has conducted far fewer tests per capita than some other countries, such as South Korea and Italy , though it has been closing the gap in recent days.  Some state governors continue to say that they have not been given access to all the test kits they need ; CBS and the New York Times reported that Trump responded to such an assertion from Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock on a Monday phone call between the President and governors, by claiming, "I haven't heard about testing in weeks."  Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, was asked on Fox News on Monday night how long it will take until the average person who feels sick with symptoms such as a dry cough, body aches and fatigue -- which can be indicative of the coronavirus -- can get tested. He responded , "It's not going to be this week or next week."  Anti-malaria drugs for coronavirus  Trump and members of his administration on Monday again mentioned two drugs that could potentially help combat the coronavirus.  Over the weekend, large drugmakers announced that they were providing millions of doses of the drugs to the federal government, and the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency approval for the Trump administration's plan to send the drugs to hospitals across the country.  The medicines, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , are anti-malaria drugs that have been used off-label at hospitals to treat coronavirus patients.  Facts First: While public health officials are hopeful that the drugs will work against coronavirus, Trump's tone hasn't matched the science, which is extremely limited and anecdotal at this early stage.  Trump's over-the-top optimism has been tamped down by the medical professionals on the White House task force handling the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top public health official on infectious diseases, said the proof is only anecdotal. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was similarly careful with his language on Monday, and referred to the drugs as "potential Covid-19 treatments."  Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs in recent weeks, even though there haven't been any clinical trials in humans proving that they work for coronavirus. Earlier this month, Trump tweeted that the drugs "have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine."  CNN Health's Arman Azad wrote about this on Sunday. He said: "Thus far, there is little scientific evidence that chloroquine, or its closely-related analogue hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. ... While there's limited evidence on the efficacy of chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said the drugs' benefits outweighed their risk."  Trump's past comments about the virus  CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta asked Trump what he has to say to Americans who are upset with him for having repeatedly downplayed the virus in February and early March. Acosta read out a series of Trump quotes, including a February 23 remark in which Trump claimed the virus was "very much under control in this country" and a March 10 remark in which Trump said , "It will go away. Just stay calm, it will go away."  Trump responded, "If you look at those individual statements, they're all true: stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away."  Facts First: Trump's previous comments were not "all true." The virus was clearly not "under control" in February -- nor was it under control in mid-March, when Trump made Trump's previous comments were not "all true." The virus was clearly not "under control" in February -- nor was it under control in mid-March, when Trump made another version of the claim , and nor is it under control today.  And Trump was misleading when he said on March 10 that the virus "will go away." While the virus may eventually be eliminated in the United States, Trump did not mention that thousands of Americans could die before this happened, nor that the country could have to implement drastic measures to try to slow its spread.  Experts also warn that there could be a second wave of the virus in the US even after the immediate crisis is over.  "#COVID19 won't go away. It'll infect the southern hemisphere as they winter and will want to come back to U.S. in fall," Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who formerly served as Trump's Food and Drug Administration commissioner, wrote on Twitter after Trump's comment on Monday. "But we'll have a massive surveillance system by then, and I believe more than one drug to both prevent and treat infection. Our tool box will be very different."  Seoul's population  Talking about why South Korea has conducted more coronavirus tests per capita than the US, Trump noted that South Korea is more densely populated. He said, "I know South Korea better than anybody. It's a very tight. Do you know how many people are in Seoul? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is? Thirty-eight million people. That's bigger than anything we have."  Facts First: Trump was wrong about Seoul's population. The population of the city itself was Trump was wrong about Seoul's population. The population of the city itself was about 10 million in 2019 . The Seoul metropolitan region, known as the Seoul Capital Area, had a population of about 26 million

2020-03-31	(CNN) It is falling to President Donald Trump to lead America into its most tragic month in decades, as experts say the coronavirus pandemic could kill more citizens than the Vietnam and Korean wars combined.  But the President's bullish, self-congratulatory rhetoric -- a staple of a presidency that has divided the nation -- is still jarring with the desperate reality of a fast-worsening pandemic that is running out of control.  On the day that heralded another grim new record in reported deaths -- more than 500 -- and that the fatality toll was roughly on par with those killed on September 11, 2001, Trump opened his daily news conference with a stark message, even though he still struggles to summon the empathy appropriate for such a time of mourning.  Trump, who will be called upon to steady an anguished nation in the days to come, warned the country of a "vital 30 days" ahead, a day after extending social distancing guidelines until the end of April.  "Our future is in our own hands and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory," he said.  Historic test  No recent President has faced the kind of pervasive public health crisis that now confronts Trump. No administration's response would be completely surefooted. And Trump's optimism is important for a country that may be about to lose tens of thousands of citizens, according to forecasting models. His belated decision to listen to top public health officials represents progress and will save many lives.  The President's administration faces many crucial decisions in the coming days that will determine how grave the eventual death toll will be, and how quickly the economic shutdown that has pitched millions out of work can be lifted. He must put in place intricate plans to stem the full fury of Covid-19 and to eventually ease the nation out of its defensive crouch.  It's no exaggeration to say Trump faces the most critical month of his presidency yet -- and how he conducts himself will be crucial for the country and his own hopes of reelection. But there are signs that he does not fully understand the stakes nor is willing to relegate his own interests in favor of the common good.  Trump still appears to be marveling at the spread of the virus, which he says no one could have predicted. Health experts had anticipated its arrival in the US for months as he predicted a miracle would occur and it would just go away.  And on a day when so many Americans died, he boasted at one point that his hair blowing in the breeze in the White House Rose Garden was his own, marking an inappropriate tone for a harrowing national moment.  Trump blasted reporters for asking "snarky" questions when they use facts and his own words to point out shortcomings in the effort to combat the virus in the United States, which now has more confirmed infections than any other nation. His reaction did not dispel the impression that he is more interested in protecting his reputation than fixing mistakes that may worsen the pandemic.  Governors warn federal government is still falling short  There are clear signs that the federal government response -- for instance, with the approval of fast new viral testing kits and the swift construction of field hospitals -- is finally gearing up.  Yet Trump's belated mobilization of the federal government, which he touts in briefings every day -- after his weeks of downplaying the crisis -- appears likely to come too late for the peak period of infections, expected in the next few weeks.  He announced on Monday the dispatch of thousands of surgical masks and protective gear for health care workers. But front-line doctors and nurses still lack what they need.  Trump boasted that the United States had now conducted more coronavirus tests than any other nation -- more than a million. But health experts say the administration was unprepared to test sufficient people when it might have done more to stop the pandemic. And the US is still testing fewer people per capita than some other countries, such as South Korea.  Trump lauded Ford and GE, saying they would churn out 50,000 ventilators in 100 days. But governors in multiple states told the President on Monday that they lacked the machines and other supplies needed ahead of a surge on hospitals within days.  In his news conference, he denied there had been any criticism of his leadership in his call with governors.  "I think for the most part, I think they were saying thank you for doing such a great job," the President said.  With Trump in the thick of his reelection race, his daily early evening briefings are increasingly fusing with his political strategy, and the crisis is already shaping the 2020 race.  On Sunday, he embraced warnings by senior health officials that 100,000 or more Americans could die from coronavirus if he failed to extend his self-distancing guidelines. Trump alone among senior officials had been itching to ease the measures.  There was a subtle yet significant shift in his rhetoric on Monday.  "By very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives. Think of that: 1 million American lives," the President said.  The comment suggested that at the end of a national disaster that has been exacerbated by his leadership failings, he will bill himself as a victorious wartime President who rescued many Americans from death.  Split America  JUST WATCHED CNN exit polls: Trump on majority of Dem voters' minds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN exit polls: Trump on majority of Dem voters' minds 01:07  National Democrats -- who unlike governors do not have to work with the federal government each day -- appear to be laying the groundwork to block this strategy with their own new counter-messaging. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Sunday on CNN: "As the President fiddles, people are dying."  Trump's entire presidency has been an exercise in whipping up his political base, and a new CNN/SSRS poll on the pandemic suggests his leadership in this crisis is following a familiar model.  Some 48% of Americans said the government has done a good job in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus, while 47% say the government has done a poor job. Opinions are sharply split according to partisan identification -- a factor likely to hamper national unity at a vital moment.  Some 77% of Republicans say the federal government is doing a good job preventing the virus's spread, compared with 27% of Democrats.  Trump's news conferences remain a self-serving mix of the most positive developments in the coronavirus fight, saved up for campaign-style announcements. On Monday, Trump posed like a game show host's assistant as he lifted a new testing kit out of its box for the cameras -- and the President basked in testimonials to his leadership from Cabinet officials and invited corporate CEOs.  The reality of the coronavirus crisis appears far less upbeat on the front lines than it does from Trump's boisterous sessions in the White House Rose Garden, however.  Maryland's Larry Hogan, a Republican who's one of several governors who introduced tough stay-at-home orders on Monday, warned that the Washington metro area was likely to replicate the difficult scenes in New York soon.  "We're just two weeks behind New York, with ... higher numbers here than they were at two weeks ago," Hogan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.  Hogan warned that warnings by the federal government's top infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci that 100,000 Americans could die in the pandemic were a best case scenario.  "Just to put that in perspective, that's more than the number of Americans that died in the Vietnam war and the Korean war added together. And we're not talking about over a number of years. We're talking about in a very short period of time," Hogan said.
2020-03-31	(CNN) — The Taj Mahal in India has joined the list of attractions around the world that are closing their doors amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Prahlad Singh Patel, the country's Minister of Tourism, made the announcement official on his Twitter account on March 17.  "All the ticketed monuments and all other museums have been directed to be closed until March 31, 2020," he wrote.  While the announcement was sudden, the news shouldn't come as a complete surprise.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in India stands at 114, including two deaths.  "The scale and extent of our interventions have increased in alignment the evolving situation of COVID-19 [coronavirus] across the world, and India in particular," Harsh Vardhan, India's Minister of Health, told reporters earlier this month  The Taj Mahal is India's most-visited attraction. Victor Cheng  The Taj Mahal, which is the country's most-visited attraction, was mentioned as being a particular concern by Vardhan, who said there was a "containment plan" in the works for Agra, the city that is home to the structure.  Commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its name means "crown of palaces" in both Urdu and Persian.  The enormously popular marble monument often sees 50,000 visitors passing through a day. Almost 6.5 million people visited the Taj Mahal in 2018, according to statistics from the Indian Ministry of Tourism.

2020-03-31	Jennifer Lee, MD is a CNN medical analyst and a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at The George Washington University. Follow her @DrJenLee . Opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says no. China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic say yes. In some parts of China, it is mandatory to wear a mask when in public. Those caught outside not wearing a mask are stopped by police and may be fined or even arrested. In South Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong , health authorities advise everyone to wear a mask in the presence of others, especially in crowded places (i.e., riding the subway).  However, here in the United States, the CDC guidance continues to be, "If you are NOT sick: you do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a face mask)." The CDC goes on to say that "face masks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers." In line with this guidance, the US surgeon general tweeted in February, "Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!"  But as Covid-19 cases continue to climb in the United States, an increasing number of health experts, such as the director of Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Tom Inglesby , advise wearing masks as a means to prevent the proliferation of the virus. Additionally, the Trump administration is now reconsidering the nation's stance on wearing masks in public as a preventative measure. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, said that the White House is in "very active discussion" about whether to recommend the use of masks by citizens in some circumstances.  Are masks really unnecessary or are there just not enough?  Since we don't have enough face masks, we absolutely have to prioritize providing masks to those with the highest risk of infection, such as health care workers and first responders. But we, as a nation, should also be honest about whether the current guidance for healthy citizens not to use masks in public is really supported by the science or is just an attempt to prevent panic-buying and to preserve a limited resource for high risk groups.  The reality is that the proper use of face masks by citizens when they are in public spaces can benefit public health. (It should be noted that experts warn that if a face mask is worn improperly the wearer may be more susceptible to the virus, as they may touch their face more frequently.)  The US should strongly consider more widespread use of this protective gear, in addition to hand hygiene and social distancing.  What does the science tell us about masks?  We know that the virus is spread primarily by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplets can also be generated by talking, laughing, singing or just exhaling. They can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be inhaled into the lungs, which is why people have been asked to stay at least 6 feet away from each other.  It's also possible for infected droplets to be transferred to surfaces and then spread by contact when another person touches the surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. This is why public health officials have emphasized frequent hand-washing and cleaning of surfaces.  It has been suggested by institutions such as the Mayo Clinic that when someone infected with a respiratory viral illness wears a surgical mask it protects others from getting infected because the masks catch the droplets and keep them from reaching other people. But we have also learned that individuals can be infected with the coronavirus and be contagious even when they have no symptoms . In fact, it is likely that in some outbreaks, a significant number of individuals were infected by those with no symptoms who were unknowingly spreading the virus. Could they have minimized spread of the virus if they had been using face masks before they felt sick?  Also, let's be realistic about how easy it is to be less than 6 feet away from others when we're at the grocery store or taking public transportation. Would it not be worth having an additional layer of protection? While brief encounters with others involving minimal interaction may not be high risk, why have we emphasized hand-washing and disinfecting surfaces after those interactions so much more than face masks when this virus is spread largely through respiratory droplets?  The scientific evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of masks at containing viral spread when worn by healthy people.  Some studies have not found a benefit. However, many were limited because the subjects didn't wear the masks as often as they were supposed to. In contrast, the CDC's own 2017 guidance on how to prevent pandemic flu in the community stated that "the use of face masks by well persons might be beneficial in certain situations (e.g., when persons at high risk for influenza complications cannot avoid crowded settings or parents are caring for ill children at home). Face mask use by well persons also might reduce self-inoculation (e.g., touching the nose with the hand after touching a contaminated surface)."  The same logic should apply to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  What's more, we can look at the measures shown to be effective to slow community transmission of SARS in 2003 as an example of steps to be taken today. A large study in Hong Kong found that wearing a face mask regularly in public places, frequent hand-washing and disinfecting one's home were all effective in limiting the spread of that virus in the community.  Another study conducted in Beijing found that always wearing a mask when going out was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of being diagnosed with SARS during the outbreak compared with never wearing a mask.  That brings us back to the shortage. If wearing masks could help reduce the spread of the virus, how do we get more masks?  Taiwan offers a helpful model. Like the United States, Taiwan has seen an increased demand for face masks and disruptions in the supply chain. Prior to the pandemic, the majority of masks sold in Taiwan were manufactured elsewhere, with over 90% coming from China. In the past month, the Taiwanese government aggressively ramped up private manufacturing so that Taiwan can now make millions of masks per day and has enough N95 masks and hazmat suits for all their medical personnel.  The Taiwanese government also made it easier for the general public to buy surgical masks, creating a centralized online system to ration and ship them (each mask is sold for less than $0.25).  Through this system, more than 2.3 million people were given the ability to buy seven million masks over the course of a single week. Of note, Taiwan, a densely populated country of 23 million people about 80 miles off the coast of China, has had only 322 confirmed infections and five deaths due to Covid-19 as of March 31.  And Taiwan has, for the most part, not closed schools or businesses and has not implemented a lockdown.  In an effort to protect citizens with minimal disruption to everyday life, the US government should use every possible authority, leverage and funding source to rapidly manufacture or acquire more masks and ensure they are distributed in a rational way nationwide to the highest risk groups first. But then perhaps we should turn our attention to helping the general public get access to masks. If Taiwan can ratchet up private sector manufacturing in one month, the United States most certainly can, too.  What can we do in the meantime?

2020-03-31	Two nurses at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado, have told CNN that they're running out of proper sedation drugs because they've had to intubate so many patients since the coronavirus epidemic began in the US.  A nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, tells CNN that their hospital is running out of fentanyl, which they used to sedate intubated Covid-19 patients.  "We are starting to run out of proper sedation medication like propofol and fentanyl," one nurse says.  "It’s hard to watch when you have to flip these people onto their bellies and use oral medications to sedate them through their feeding tubes."  SCL Health Vice President of System Communications Nikki Sloup said that their hospital system, which includes St. Joseph's Hospital, currently has an adequate supply to meet patient needs. But Sloup warns that if they experience a patient surge, it could see shortages.  "We have put in place numerous conservation programs and continue to work with public and private partners to secure the supplies we need to provide safe and appropriate care to our patients and ensure the safety of our caregivers," Sloup told CNN in a statement.  CNN reached out to Johns Hopkins Hospital for comment but did receive a response.  One nurse said they've never seen so many ventilators being put to use.
2020-04-01	Washington (CNN) Thousands of South Koreans who work on US bases in South Korea were furloughed on Wednesday after the Trump administration and South Korea failed to reach a new cost-sharing formula for the cost of US troops stationed.  CNN previously reported that top officials warned in February the move could undermine the US military mission amid tensions with North Korea. Approximately 4,500 South Korean workers are furloughed from their jobs on various US military installations on Tuesday.  The dispute over the cost of the 28,500 US troops stationed on the Korean peninsula erupted after President Donald Trump asked for a 400% increase in South Korea's contribution under the so-called Special Measures Agreement. The demand outraged Seoul and concerned US lawmakers in both parties.  In February, a senior State Department official said US officials had "adjusted our stance" during the course of negotiations, and said they are not currently laser-focused on getting the South Koreans to increase the amount they pay by 400%.  The last deal agreed upon in February 2019 boosted South Korea's contribution from about $800 million to nearly $1 billion.  Read More
2020-04-01	London (CNN) As Covid-19 brings the world to a halt, some world leaders have spotted an opportunity to tighten their grip on power.  It gives him the authority to punish journalists if the government believes the reporting its not accurate and allows the government to hit citizens with heavy penalties for violating lockdown rules. It also prevents any elections or referendums from taking place while the measures are in effect.  The move led to calls for the European Union to act, with Italy's former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, going to far as to suggest the bloc kick Hungary out if the measures were not revoked -- something that's far easier said than done.  Orban's move is perhaps the most flagrant power grab to take place during this pandemic. However, other strongman leaders have spotted the opportunity to seize greater authority.  In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte -- a man who arrests his critics and has boasted about personally killing suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City -- has secured emergency powers, giving him greater control of public services.  Earlier this month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism after his government approved the electronic tracking of patients, using technology that had previously only been used in the fight against terrorism.  Netanyahu, of course, isn't the only leader using technology to track its citizens during the crisis. In Russia, authorities are using facial recognition technology to crack down on people violating quarantine and self-isolation.  And from South Korea to Western Europe, democratically-elected governments are using digital tools to track the whereabouts of patients with coronavirus and monitor how effectively citizens are obeying social distancing measures.  While such moves naturally spark immediate fears of political overreach from leaders, they also raise questions around what happens when this pandemic is over.  The concern is that as the world comes to terms with its way of life, citizens become numb to what were initially extreme and extraordinary measures.  "During crises, the window of what governments can get away with without pushback from the public tends to expand," says Brian Klaas, assistant professor of global politics at University College London.  In nations with strong democratic traditions, governments can be better held to account by institutional checks and balances on governments -- ensuring that these powers truly are extraordinary and subject to review. That's a little harder in countries where democratic principles have been undermined, such as Hungary.  "The problem with weak systems like Hungary is that Orban has eroded democracy for a long time and he's going to want to make this the new normal ... And he might get cheered on as he does because in crises, people look for leadership," says Klaas.  JUST WATCHED Migrant workers in India sprayed with disinfectant Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Migrant workers in India sprayed with disinfectant 01:03  It's not just Orban. Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, explains that the "new authoritarians that take advantage of democratic majoritarianism, such as Duterte in Asia, and Orban in Europe," have in recent years "accorded themselves the right to rule by decree."  While recent actions of these "new authoritarians" might seem extreme, they are largely legal and, in many cases, proportionate to the challenge of this coronavirus. Which puts the leaders of stronger democracies in a difficult position.  "Democratic leaders have to avoid any statement criticizing the actions of other leaders that might downplay the significance of the pandemic," says Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham. "But their silence now risks handing authoritarians a blank check to cash at a future date."  Worse, during a pandemic, strongman leaders can impose extraordinary measures in lockstep with nations like the United Kingdom and Italy, making them appear altogether more ordinary.  "The worrying thing during a crisis is that leaders with authoritarian instincts can claim to only be doing what some established democracies are doing," says Cheeseman. But while robust democracies are expected to eventually roll back such measures, citizens in weak democracies might get saddled with them at the behest of the leader.  Of course, this "new normal" problem doesn't apply only to nations with weakened democratic institutions.  Historically, even the United States has this century seen the executive hand itself extraordinary power during a crisis, the most obvious example of this being the Patriot Act, following the September 11 attacks in 2001.  "If a 'rally round the flag' mentality kicks in around the world, leaders could find ways to exploit it," says Klaas. "If you accept 9/11 made people happy to give up certain liberties, consider this: The Imperial study says there will be 2.2 million deaths in the US if there's no extreme and sustained government intervention. That's the equivalent of 9/11 happening nearly every day for over two years."  The example set by the US and its democratic allies really does matter. How countries like America, the UK, Germany and France emerge from this crisis will set the new bar for democratic norms.  "During crises, centralized government power is generally ratcheted up," explains Cheeseman. "However, when the crisis is over, that power is not always handed back to the public and lower levels of levels of government."  These go far beyond new legal instruments a leader might wield. As we have seen in Israel and Russia, new technologies can be used that curb people's civil liberties.  JUST WATCHED Governors contradict Trump on lack of coronavirus tests Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Governors contradict Trump on lack of coronavirus tests 01:18  Israel's electronic tracking of coronavirus patients allows the Israeli Security Agency, or Shin Bet to keep, tabs on citizens by using national ID numbers and phone numbers. Netanyahu defended approving the legislation to allow this without parliamentary oversight, claiming that "the virus is spreading at a tremendous pace, a delay of even one hour in these tools can lead to the deaths of many Israelis." The Knesset did later approve the use of the tracking technology, mandating it receive regular reports on how the information gathered had been used.  Moscow's police claimed earlier this month that Russia's facial recognition system had led to 200 people flouting lockdown rules being caught and fined, a hardline message that in a time of crisis could play well with the public.  "We want there to be even more cameras so that that there is no dark corner or side street left," said Oleg Baranov, Moscow's police chief, before saying that he wanted to add 9,000 cameras to the existing network of 170,000.  And as nations ramp up efforts to handle the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, large, government-funded bureaucracies will be set up, handling everything from distributing medicines and benefits to nationalizing infrastructure.  Laws on criminal detention might also be tweaked to impose lockdown measures in countries. Even in countries like the UK and France, police have been given extraordinary powers to implement social distancing rules.  The fear is that those technologies, laws and institutions will outlive any government of the day and be exploited for political gain in the years that follow this crisis.  "Even break clauses wouldn't necessarily help when it comes to new technologies because they don't cover infrastructure and technology changes that come into place during a crisis," says Cheeseman. "Cameras that tracked terrorists were then used to track extinction rebellion protestors; legislation that allows governments to detain suspects for longer in a crisis often stays on the books."  And leaders that emerge from the pandemic on the front foot might, as Khanna puts it, not "let a crisis go to waste."  At some point, this crisis will end and citizens around the world will be free to leave their homes. However, it's becoming abundantly clear that the world they walk into will be dramatically different from the one they left behind their front doors. And if the global population hasn't twigged this yet, their leaders already have.  "Taking advantage of a crisis has little to do with managing it well," says Khanna. "Strongmen leaders or elected authoritarians should never be confused with public-spirited technocrats ... they are very much wolves in sheep's clothing."  Global crises have a habit of creating distractions that leaders can exploit for their own power hunger. Right now, the world has plenty of power-hungry leaders. Couple that with a crisis the likes of which most of us have never seen, and it's not hard to see how this coronavirus global outbreak could be bad news for democracy, and those who depend on it.
2020-04-01	(CNN) Shin-Soo Choo, an outfielder and designated hitter for the Texas Rangers, is giving every player in the Rangers' minor league system $1,000 to help alleviate the financial hit they may take amid the coronavirus pandemic.  That's 191 players, meaning the 37-year-old from South Korea is pledging $191,000.  "I can help other people," Choo, who is heading into his final year of a $130 million, seven-year contract, said Wednesday in a conference call. "That's a good thing."  "Twenty years ago ... coming from Korea, I (had) nothing," he said. "Baseball gives me a lot of things. I want to pay back to other people...It's a hard situation in the world, but still I can help other people."  Choo spent seven years in the minor leagues. He remembers how little money he had in those days, and said at times he would skip dinner to keep his $20 meal money.  Read More
2020-04-01	(CNN) A growing chorus of Tennessee doctors and local leaders want Gov. Bill Lee to issue a stay-at-home order, warning that the coronavirus outbreak will only worsen in the state if he doesn't.  At least 80% of the U.S. population is under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, according to a CNN count. In Tennessee, Lee has resisted issuing a mandate, opting instead to issue an order that strongly urges residents to stay at home.  "I want again, to speak to the Tennesseans, who have the privilege and the capacity to safely stay home for the next two weeks. We need you to do that," Lee said at a press conference on Tuesday.  Signed Monday, the order closes non-essential businesses that were still open, like hair salons, spas, theaters, concert venues and other entertainment establishments. Churches are exempt from the state order which took effect overnight on Tuesday.  Lee said Monday that he was not issuing a mandated shelter in place order because it is "deeply important to me" to protect personal liberties.
2020-04-01	(CNN) The Trump administration will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas as the United States grapples with critical shortages of supplies and coronavirus cases continue to soar.  A congressional source told CNN on Wednesday that they were informed late last Friday night that the coronavirus task force -- led by Vice President Mike Pence -- was stopping overseas shipments of the medical equipment and instead asking that the supplies be distributed within the United States.  Asked about reports of the freeze on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said there was "no truth whatsoever" to them. However, minutes later, he noted that "whatever we have, whatever we've committed to, we commit," but added that "we also need a lot for ourselves."  "Obviously, we're not going to be shipping too much," he said during a White House briefing.  Politico was the first to report on the freeze. CNN has reached out to the US Agency for International Development for comment.  Read More
2020-04-01	A person wearing a mask walks on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California on April 1. Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Residents of Los Angeles should wear non-medical grade face coverings when in public, the city's mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news conference Tuesday.  Garcetti emphasized that all medical-grade N95 masks were reserved for front-line workers in hospitals and clinics.  “Please do not get medical grade or surgical masks, or N95 masks. We must not contribute to the shortage of these essential personal protective equipment for medial personnel and first responders,” he said.  Face coverings, like a bandanna, are only effective with safe physical distancing, he added. There are currently 8,155 cases of the virus in California.  Global debate on face masks: Despite the regular use of masks in Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Western governments have been slow to embrace them to stop the spread of the virus.  But with the number of new cases remaining low or stable in Asia, it appears that more countries in the West may change their approach.

2020-04-01	He stood in front of his coronavirus task force and, in somber terms, told the public that the next two weeks would see more illness and more death. He acknowledged that the death toll, if America keeps to its current social distancing guidelines, will likely fall somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 dead Americans.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  "Our country is in the midst of a great national trial unlike any it has ever faced before," Trump said.  Which, well, it's about time.  The truth here is that everything Trump said on Tuesday about the spread and dangers -- and even the number of dead -- has been known publicly for weeks. The only leader who failed to acknowledge it was, well, the President.  "So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"  Even when he sent that tweet, scientists and infectious disease experts were telling anyone who would listen that this was NOT the flu -- its mortality rate was far higher, we had no herd immunity to it and there was no vaccine.  Trump didn't want to believe that. So he decided it was wrong. And through his words and actions -- whether his tweets and public statements downplaying the threat or his administration's too-slow reaction to the lack of adequate testing -- Trump's decisions helped get us to this bad place.  Now, to be clear: This is not to lay blame for the coronavirus at Trump's feet. This was -- and is -- a virus that had never before been transmitted to humans. There is no vaccine. Governments around the world are struggling with combating it and protecting their citizens even as I write.  But there is NO question that Trump's downplaying of the virus in these critical last few weeks has played a role in the fact that we are now faced with the blunt reality of significantly more deaths of Americans from coronavirus than died in the Vietnam War ( 58,220 ).  "There's no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus," Bill Gates wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post on Wednesday.  The Boston Globe editorial board was even more blunt, writing in an editorial headlined " A president unfit for a pandemic :"  "While the spread of the novel coronavirus has been aggressive around the world, much of the profound impact it will have here in the United States was preventable. As the American public braces itself for the worst of this crisis, it's worth remembering that the reach of the virus here is not attributable to an act of God or a foreign invasion, but a colossal failure of leadership.  "The outbreak that began in China demanded a White House that could act swiftly and competently to protect public health, informed by science and guided by compassion and public service. It required an administration that could quickly deploy reliable tests around the nation to isolate cases and trace and contain the virus's spread, as South Korea effectively did, as well as to manufacture and distribute scarce medical supplies around the country. It begged for a president of the United States to deliver clear, consistent, scientifically sound messages on the state of the epidemic and its solutions, to reassure the public amid their fear, and to provide steady guidance to cities and states. And it demanded a leader who would put the country's well-being first, above near-term stock market returns and his own reelection prospects, and who would work with other nations to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases around the world."  Trump is in the process of doing what he always does: Rewriting history -- and, specifically, his own actions to ensure that he is the hero of the story. Over the past 48 hours, he has repeatedly cited estimates that without any interventions -- like social distancing -- more than 2 million Americans could lose their lives as a result of the coronavirus.  Which, sure. But there was never ANY question as to whether the US needed to follow best practices on how to flatten the curve on the spread of the coronavirus. Especially given that Trump -- and the rest of the country -- saw how coronavirus had affected China and led to an effective shuttering of society to stop its spread.  What Trump is doing is the equivalent of taking out your parents' brand-new car, getting in an accident because you were looking at your phone while driving and then telling them that they are lucky that the smashed-up front end is the only damage because it would have been worse without your amazing driving skills. Your parents wouldn't buy that. They'd want you to not have been looking at your phone and for their new car not to be damaged.  Again, I am not saying that Trump and his administration could have prevented all deaths in America from the coronavirus. Because of the openness of our society and the infection/mortality rate of this virus, that would have been totally impossible.  But what I am suggesting is that Trump doesn't deserve plaudits for finally realizing and acknowledging the severity of this crisis when there are already 3,000+ Americans dead and even the rosiest projections suggest tens of thousands more will die.  Keep in mind that South Korea and the United States both got their first cases on the same day: January 20. The two countries took very different approaches in responding to the virus. South Korea has so far reported 165 deaths from the coronavirus and successfully flattened its curve due to aggressive testing and isolation practices  There were ways in the US -- stocking up earlier on needed medical equipment like masks and ventilators, widespread availability of testing, a federal shelter-in-place edict -- in which the catastrophic loss of life we are now facing could have been mitigated. Trump didn't do those things and, worse, he publicly dismissed concerns about the virus, sending a signal to many Americans that they should go on with their daily lives. (Trump isn't the only politician guilty of this; New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio did the same earlier this month .)  Those decisions inarguably made things worse. And played a major role where we are today -- hoping that only 100,000 of our fellow Americans die from coronavirus.
2020-04-02	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that airplane and train passengers are being given "very strong tests" for the coronavirus both before departure and after arrival.  Asked at a White House briefing if he is considering a temporary ban on domestic flights and rail travel, Trump said he was thinking about how to handle flights to and from virus "hot spots," but that it's "a very tough thing" to shut down "entire transportation systems." He also claimed that there are safeguards already in place.  "They're doing tests on airlines -- very strong tests -- for getting on, getting off. They're doing tests on trains -- getting on, getting off," he said  Facts First: There is no evidence plane and train passengers in the US are being tested for the coronavirus at all, let alone both when they get on and get off. Trump might have meant to refer to screening -- which involves questioning and sometimes temperature checks -- rather than actual testing, but major US airlines and rail company Amtrak are not doing screening, either. Some plane passengers are being subjected to government screening upon landing, but most passengers are not -- and this screening, unlike testing, cannot conclusively determine whether someone has the virus.
2020-04-02	CNN  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 response, chimed in on the current debate about when to wear face masks and who should be wearing them.  "What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks -- medical masks, not N95 masks with respirators. Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients," she said.  "We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks," she said.  She said right now, it's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers.  "We have to prioritize the use of masks for frontline workers, if that is one thing I can stress. Medical masks, respirators, gloves, gowns, these are people who are putting their lives on the line to help us, to care for other people and they must be protected," she said.  The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks. US health officials recommended the same, but may be shifting course.  On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection. Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days.  When asked about President Trump's suggestion that people use facial coverings like scarves, Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating.  "We are constantly looking at evidence, all the time, for the use of masks for anything that is related to this and related to health issues. We are talking with scientists around the world, including US CDC scientists," she said.  Read more about the global debate on face masks here:  Watch:

2020-04-02	Tokyo (CNN Business) Salary men in suits crammed into trains during the rush-hour commute are staple scenes in Tokyo.  Up until a few weeks ago, 52-year-old Hideya Tokiyoshi, who traveled into the capital from neighboring Saitama prefecture for work each day, was among them.  The English-language teacher moved to online lessons after his students grew anxious over the coronavirus pandemic , which has killed more than 46,800 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University.  Tokiyoshi, however, is a rare case.  While Tokyo's governor Yuriko Koike has urged the city's 13.5 million residents to telework where possible until April 12, and major Japanese companies such asandhave asked staff to work from home, many employees are still commuting into the capital, where subway trains are busy during rush hour.  It's a similar story across Japan, where about 80% of companies do not have the ability to let their employees work remotely, according to 2019 government data.  And with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week declining to declare a state of emergency, which would put pressure on businesses to enforce social distancing, companies can still legally operate from their offices.  People wearing a protective face mask wait at a pedestrian crossing Thursday, April 2, 2020, in Tokyo.  Underpinning this is Japan's notorious hard-work culture. A 2016 government study found that one in five employees was at risk of working themselves to death. The country even has its own word for it: "karoshi," or death by overwork, which is defined as employees working so hard that they die from stress-related diseases — or become so depressed that they kill themselves.  "The [coronavirus] information is on our mind and we're scared more than you would expect," tweeted Tokiyoshi recently. "But for average Japanese, work is always the highest priority and the biggest excuse.  "Unless [the] government shuts all businesses down with a few exemptions, no one will stay at home. We're slaves to work."  Exposing old habits  The now-delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics were meant to showcase Japan as a high-tech nation with robots showing guests to their seats and artificial meteorites in the sky.  In reality, often people are wedded to more traditional ways of conducting business.  The fax machine, for example, remains a fixture in many offices, and people still use the company stamp to give official documents a seal of approval. In Japan, personal and company stamps are often used instead of electronic or handwritten signatures.

MUST WATCH Experts call for more testing as coronavirus worsens 03:05  But Rochelle Kopp, a business consultant at Japan Intercultural Consulting who has worked between Japan and the United States for more than three decades, says Japanese firms have not made sufficient IT investments to do this.  Many employees don't have laptops they can take home, Kopp said, and companies do not have VPNs or remote access to their servers, meaning things can only be accessed in person at the office.  To accelerate change as the coronavirus crisis continues, Japan's Ministry of Labor is offering grants of up to $77,000 to help small and medium-sized companies prepare for teleworking, said Misaki Togoshi, a spokeswoman at the Japanese Teleworking Association.  Commuters wearing face masks ride on a train on March 26, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.  Nevertheless, barriers remain. "We've started receiving up to 25 applications a day since March 9 from companies that want to adopt teleworking practices, but the funding is finite so not everyone will receive it," Togoshi said.  Another barrier is that a quarter of Japan's population is aged 65 and over . Many still occupy senior positions and are not known for being tech savvy. In 2018, for example, the country's then 68-year-old cybersecurity minister admitted he had never used a computer in his professional life.  "Even if the hardware became available, older people may not have the experience or knowledge to adapt quickly," said Hisakazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo. "There's a clear digital divide in Japan."  Face-to-face work culture  The reluctance to close offices and work remotely speaks to Japan's intense work culture, where employees are expected to put in long hours.  "Some workers will stay at the office after hours because they think that the boss may be coming back after dinner with his associates," said Jesper Koll, a Japan-based economist and financial strategist. "All of this is very real part of Japanese corporate culture."  The cultural emphasis on collective decision-making in Japan can also make people feel reluctant to work from home, where they will not be physically surrounded by colleagues.  "The situation in Japan is a bit unique compared to other countries where people have a more individualistic work style. It's easier for them to transition to teleworking," Kato said. "In Japan, one person can't make an important decision alone at their home — people have to come together to make decisions."  Japanese office workers are seen reflected in a window as they walk to a train station.  In many places, governments have led by example. In Hong Kong, for instance, the government announced that civil servants would work from home when it asked private businesses to let employees work remotely.  Japan has not done that. While some government employees are teleworking, many are still going into the office.  Nakane Tsuyoshi, a human resources officer at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Tokyo, is going to work, although the ministry has staggered the arrival times of staff, with some starting at 8 a.m. and others at 10 a.m.. "We would worry that we can't help people and get the job done properly if we worked worked from home," he said.  At the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, workers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the delayed Olympics and those answering calls from the public are still going to the office, according to a spokesman.  Service industry  More than 70% of Japan's workforce was also employed in the service sector in 2019, according to Japan's Bureau of Statistics. For many of those workers, it is near impossible to telework, Kato said.  Haru, who works as a massage therapist in a mall in Tokyo, still catches a bus to work. But now many customers are canceling their reservations, especially since 78 people tested positive for coronavirus in the capital on Tuesday — the country's highest single-day jump.  "I'm anxious as the number of cases keeps going up in Tokyo and I want to stay at home. But I feel conflicted," Haru said.  "Even if the boss told us to close the shop and stay at home, we would have nothing to fall back on. So far, the government has only told people to avoid public gatherings and that has meant fewer customers for us. But the government hasn't specifically said how they would support businesses teetering on the edge."  Bebe Ishikawa runs a Tokyo business supplying fruit to cake shops, hotels and wedding venues. She manages five staff in her office, all of whom come to work.  "If they take the train, I tell them to come in late or leave early to avoid the rush hour or to take a traxi to and from their homes," she said.  Ishikawa said she understood that a complete lockdown might be needed eventually to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but warned that many businesses would go bankrupt.  "If we stop delivering our produce then that means our customers can't sell their commodity so each link in the supply chain is affected," she said.  False sense of security?  So far Japan — a country of 127 million people — has more than 2,300 cases of coronavirus, including 57 deaths. A total of 472 people have recovered.  Commuters wait in line at a bus stop on March 26, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.  However, Japan has only tested about 34,508 people, compared with over 431,700 people tested in South Korea, which has a population of 51 million  The relatively low recorded infection rate has created a sense of security in Japan, which could be encouraging workers to go into their offices.  "The [Japanese] government should be stricter like in Europe," Kato said. "The government has too much faith in the public doing the right thing by themselves, but they should send a clearer and more decisive message that tells people that this [coronavirus] situation is really serious."  Back in Saitama, Tokiyoshi has embraced his teleworking lifestyle and found more time for passion projects. He and his students have overcome the occasional delayed connection, and he hopes this work style can become more accepted in the long term.  "Before, people thought it would be impossible for people to work from home as employees might not be able to focus on their jobs. But now people have realized they can do a lot of things from home," he said.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) Want to feel better in this moment of crisis? Stop binge-watching the shows. Put down the ice cream. (They'll be there later.) Tune in to Tony Fauci when he appears on TV or better yet, listen to him chat with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his CNN podcast.  When you do, you'll hear the leader we need as others fail us. Dr. Fauci is a man with a scientific mind, a compassionate heart, and a Jesuitical commitment to helping others. He refuses to blame even the President, who was tragically slow to heed his counsel. And he won't stop fighting until we are safe.  If you don't know him by now, Anthony Fauci is the silver-haired, bespectacled physician-scientist who stands in the background at White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic and steps up to speak when the questions get technical and, more importantly, demand precise, authoritative answers. Head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, he has taken responsibility for fights against everything from HIV/AIDS to now Covid-19, and has never sought to hold the spotlight or grab credit.  For weeks it has been Fauci who has countered the President's hype about possible treatments and vaccines with realism. An anti-malarial drug Trump feels good about will need "the kind of trial where you get the good information," Fauci said. A vaccine would be great, but won't arrive sooner than 12 to 18 months.  As he offers sober facts like these to counter President Trump's loose and emotional talk, Fauci performs some nearly miraculous feats. First, he manages to contradict the President without provoking his ire. Second, he gives the country reasonable hope. Lastly, he demonstrates what compassionate authority and grace under fire really look like.  You may be surprised to learn, as I was, that the nimble-minded, indefatigable Fauci is 79 years old. Daily exercise -- 3.5 miles of running or power-walking -- has blessed him with a level of fitness that puts many people decades younger to shame. A lifetime of engagement with high-level medical science seems to have kept his mind young in the same way.  However, it is Fauci's strong character that we sense when listening to him speak with care for both the facts and the human beings who now hang on his words.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  "I'm very much of a people person but also I'm very analytical and very scientific," Fauci explained to Gupta on the CNN podcast. He recalled attending a Jesuit high school and college and noted that "the one theme always underlying our interactions was service to others." Put it together -- "science, I like people, service to others" -- and "that's medicine."  Listen to Fauci talk with Gupta one-on-one, physician-to-physician, and you hear how much he cares about the people and science he is supposed to serve. Free of the tension that the President brings to the White House briefings, the podcast conversation offers Fauci unfiltered. You can feel the affection and concern he expresses for every person he mentions and for the country he serves. You can also hear a mind on fire as he describes the puzzle of Covid-19's effects on those who contract it.  As Fauci says on the podcast, many people suffer only mild illness before recovering fully but some endure a shocking turn for the worse. Speaking of "the dynamics of the virus against our attempt to mitigate it" he observes that a patient can be doing well then "bingo, they're on a respirator. They're on ecmo (heart/lung treatment.) Then they're dead."  Fauci's tone is not callous but rather it echoes with the clinical fascination a general might feel for a persistent battlefield foe. "There's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing," he adds, "from the pathogenesis standpoint."  The tenacity that Fauci has displayed as a scientist was evident early in his life when, as a kid surrounded by Brooklyn Dodgers fanatics, he remained devoted to the Yankees. Though bookish, he worked construction during school vacations, and though slightly built, he was a fierce competitor on the basketball court.  These experiences helped him develop the skills that let him navigate around difficulty throughout his profession. He became fast friends with activists who at first vilified him during the AIDS crisis. Now he's forging a productive relationship with a President who, famously dismissive of experts and advisors, considers gut instinct to be his compass.  Somehow Fauci seems to have won President Trump's confidence even as he has corrected him in real time. In this way the doctor has served both the President and the country while maintaining his own credibility. Neither a toady nor an attention-seeker, he has put himself in the position to tell everyone the truth, even when it's hard to hear. Fauci has been the target of criticism from some on the far right who falsely accuse him of being politically opposed to Trump.  On the podcast Fauci agrees that in the federal response, "there probably were some missed opportunities." Considering how America has lagged behind South Korea and others, to say otherwise would be foolish.  But Fauci says he is more concerned about the future right now than the past.  When it's over, he hopes the country will make itself better prepared for the next public health threat. In the meantime, he'll lead, with a modesty and seriousness that is refreshing in this age of Trump.  "I'm doing everything I can," he says, "and I'm not alone."
2020-04-02	Tokyo (CNN) Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing a public backlash after he said the government would distribute two reusable cloth face masks per household amid growing concern over medical shortages as the country faces a worsening coronavirus outbreak.  The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks, after it appeared that Japan's initial response had got the virus relatively under control. As of Wednesday, there were more than 2,300 cases across Japan, and 57 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally  That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place in Tokyo and other major cities, and a run on protective gear, including face masks. On Wednesday, Abe said the provision of cloth masks to the worst hit areas "will be helpful in responding to the rapidly increasing demand."  But Abe's proposal to send two masks to each household attracted outrage and mockery online Wednesday, with the hashtag "Abe's mask" and "screw your two masks" trending on Twitter.  Many felt the move was lackluster and would not go into effect fast enough to have a chance at curbing the spread of the virus, with masks not due to be distributed until the end of the month. Others dubbed the policy "Abenomask policy" as satirical memes showing well-known cartoon characters sharing one mask between four family members popped up online.

2020-04-02	(CNN) The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, under newly invoked biosecurity laws.  Home Minister Peter Dutton's office said in a statement Wednesday that the fines were one of several new emergency measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country as doctors attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  To date, more than 5,000 people in Australia, including Dutton himself , have contracted the virus.  Under the new measures, authorities have amended customs regulations to "stop exploitative exports of essential goods," and to ensure that all surrendered medical supplies are redistributed to the national stockpile.  Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ($128,275), while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars ($38,480), Dutton's office said.

2020-04-03	Alex Brandon/AP  President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both stumbled over medical details, and spread inaccurate information, while touting new coronavirus tests and potential treatments.  Trump mentioned anti-malaria drugs that are being tested as potential treatments, saying that the clinical trials are “having some good results,” even though public health officials say the results are months away.  Moments later, Vice President Mike Pence said the Food and Drug Administration had “approved” a new method to test the coronavirus, even though the FDA only granted emergency authorization for the test, which requires a much lower standard.  Facts First: Both comments overstate the medical realities a bit. For Trump, he has repeatedly touted and expressed unbridled optimism about the drugs, even without conclusive scientific data to back up his claims. For Pence, he oversold the FDA’s confidence in the new Covid-19 test.  In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly touted two pharmaceuticals, chloroquine and the chemically similar hydroxychloroquine, as potential “game-changers” that could end the pandemic and save lives.  This is the continuation of a glaring messaging gap within the administration. Trump has breathlessly promoted the drugs while the public health officials are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence, and tamping down expectations, by saying that the information out there already is only anecdotal and not proven on a large-scale.  Later in the press conference, Pence brought up the new blood test for coronavirus antibodies. “And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA, once again, in near record time, has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex,” Pence said.  This isn’t quite accurate. The FDA uses very specific terminology about medical drugs, tests and equipment, and the FDA would likely disagree with the notion that it “approved” the test. These terms are important, as medical professionals need clarity to be sure their use of these items is safe for every patient.  What really happened was that the FDA granted “emergency use authorization” for the tests. This essentially means that the FDA will let health care providers use the tests during this crisis, even though it hasn’t gone through all the steps that medicines and medical tests usually go through before receiving a full “approval."
2020-04-03	(CNN) In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell, and therefore taste, is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of the disease called Covid-19.  "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.  "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones."  While fever, cough and shortness of breath are the key classic signs of contracting Covid-19, a recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.  In response, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK, a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom, are calling for the loss of smell or taste to be added to the screening tools for possible Covid-19 infection.  But those with worrisome signs -- which may or may not be coronavirus -- are being told to stay home and monitor their symptoms so as not to stress already overburdened hospitals, clinics and heath care workers struggling to save lives.  So is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell?  The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test."  'Jellybean test'  "You take a jellybean in one hand, and with the other hand you hold your nose tightly so you're not getting any air flow," said Steven Munger, director of the Center for Smell and Taste at the University of Florida.  "You put the jellybean in your mouth and chew it. Let's say it's a fruit flavor jellybean: if you get the savory plus the sweetness of the jellybean you'll know you have functional taste," Munger said.  "Then, while still chewing, suddenly release your nose. If you have a sense of smell you'll suddenly get all the odors and you'll say 'Oh! that's a lemon jellybean,' or 'Oh! that's cherry.' It's really a very dramatic, quick, 'Wow' type of response," he explained.  "So if you can go from sweet and sour to the full flavor and know what the flavor is," Munger said, "then your sense of smell is probably in pretty good shape."  The scientific name for this process is retro nasal olfaction, where the odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity.  But what if you don't have a jellybean? You can use other foods too, said ear, nose and throat specialist Dr. Erich Voigt, director of the division of sleep otolaryngology at NYU Langone Health.  "The pure smell sense would be if you can smell a particular substance that's not stimulating other nerves," Voigt said. "So some examples of that would be if you can smell ground coffee or coffee brewing, or if you can smell someone peeling an orange. That's the smell sense."  But you have to be careful, because it's easy to think you're using your sense of smell when you're not, Voigt said.  "So for example, ammonia or cleaning solutions, those stimulate the trigeminal nerve, which is an irritant nerve," he said. "And so people will think, 'Oh, I can smell Clorox, I can smell ammonia, which means I can smell.' But no, that's not correct. They're not actually smelling, they're using the trigeminal nerve."  Still aren't sure if you're getting it right? Check the internet for medically-based scratch and sniff tests.  Smell loss is common  Of course, not everyone who flunks a smell test is going to have coronavirus. Any respiratory virus, such as cold or flu, will temporarily impact smell and taste, sometimes even permanently.  "The amount of swelling that can occur in the nose from the viral effect can prevent the smell particles from getting all the way up to the top of the nose where the olfactory nerve is," Voigt said. "When that swelling goes down, the sense of smell can return."  But there are also neurotoxic viruses, some of which are in the common cold category, Voigt said.  "If they're neurotoxic, that means that they harm the olfactory nerve and it becomes essentially nonfunctional," he added. "Many of those cases can recover smell with time, but sometimes it's a permanent loss."  A partial or complete chronic loss of smell is incredibly common, Munger said, affecting millions of Americans long before the novel coronavirus burst upon the scene.  "About 13% of the population has a significant smell or taste impairment," he said.  Besides cold and flu, other causes of smell loss include nasal polyps, tumors, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, and traumatic brain injury or head trauma, including whiplash.  "If someone has been in an auto accident or had a whiplash injury or head injury, that could also impact the little nerves as they go from the brain down to the nose," Voigt said. "So a whiplash injury could also cause a permanent loss of sense of smell."  A loss of taste is commonly associated with the loss of smell, because we rely on smell to identify flavors. But there can also be medical reasons: Some medications can affect taste; chemotherapy and radiation therapy can certainly disrupt taste; and then there is physical damage, such as nerves severed during dental surgeries.  A coronavirus connection  If you believe you've lost your sense of smell (and do not have a medical reason to explain the loss), experts say to take the symptom seriously.  "At this point I would be fairly confident to put it in the same category as, say, fever," said Munger. "Obviously a variety of things can cause a fever. But if you lose your sense of smell quickly you want to self-isolate and contact your physician to talk about what actionable steps you might want to take."  Voigt agrees: "My recommendation is you should self-isolate and quarantine for about 14 days and don't spread that virus to other people," he said. "If you have to go out, wear a mask so that you're not sharing the virus with others."  If you do experience a loss of smell, take care because there are dangers such as not being able to smell a gas leak, or perceive rotten milk or rancid food.  And be aware that the loss of smell can occur further into the illness, along with other, more common symptoms.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  "It can precede the viral symptoms," Voigt said. "There were people with very mild illness symptoms, but they did lose their sense of smell. And there are other patients where the loss of smell kicked in after they were having fever and chills.  "So the timeline is not predictive," he stressed. "And it's also not a predictive sign of the severity of the disease -- it does not predict that you're going to get the bad pulmonary complications at this point. We don't have any data saying that."
2020-04-03	Tokyo (CNN) Each day seems to bring more bad news for Tokyo.  The daily count of new coronavirus cases has doubled in the past week, from about 40 in the final days of March to 97 on Thursday and 89 on Friday, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.  If the current trend continues, the outlook is bleak, said Kentaro Iwata, an infection control specialist from Kobe University, who has repeatedly warned that Japan isn't doing enough to halt the spread of the virus.  "Japan needs to have the courage to change, when we are aware we are on the wrong path," Iwata said. "We might see the next New York City in Tokyo."  New York is considered the epicenter of America's coronavirus outbreak. There, the number of known cases is doubling every five days, according to a CNN count . More than 2,900 people have died.  As of Friday, Japan had 3,329 confirmed cases and 74 deaths.  "The beginning of the burst of the infections in Spain, France, Italy, New York City -- was really like Tokyo right now," said Iwata.  He says there needs to be more testing.  As of Friday, Tokyo had tested fewer than 4,000 people in a city of 13.5 million. And just 39,466 people had been tested in this nation of 125 million, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.  That's a tiny fraction compared to countries in the region and around the world. As of Friday, South Korea -- which has a much smaller population than Japan -- had tested more than 440,000 people.  The Japanese government says its testing regime is adequate and suitably targeted to high risk cases.  "Testing people with a low probability of novel coronavirus would be a waste of resources," Japan's Health Ministry told CNN in a statement. "We ask people with some symptoms to stay home for a period of time."  Turned down for a test  Coronavirus patient Issei Watanabe spoke to CNN from his Tokyo hospital room. He struggled to breathe in between coughing fits. Doctors consider his a "mild case" and expect he'll be discharged on Tuesday.  Watanabe is 40, a non-smoker, in good health. His symptoms came on quickly. Body aches, chills, no sense of taste or smell.  #breaking Japan Health Ministry confirms 235 more infections and 3 deaths from coronavirus on Thursday.

Watanabe says he infected at least two people during that time.  "People don't know what to do. There's a real lack of good information," Watanabe said. "Your life is in your hands. Stay home. Please stay home. Don't go out."  Watanabe worries about the tens of millions of Japanese who are older than 65. He knows he'll recover, but many in Japan's aging society won't.  Infectious disease experts warn of a steep price in human life -- if coronavirus spreads rapidly, in this rapidly aging society.  "Coronavirus is very dangerous to old people," said Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japan's nonprofit Medical Governance Research Institute. He said most coronavirus patients in Japan are likely showing few, if any, symptoms.  "When they are asymptomatic, they can transmit the coronavirus to others," Kami warned.  No lockdown  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly stated the situation inside Japan does not warrant declaring a state of emergency or imposing a lockdown in Tokyo.  He said such drastic measures would further damage an economy already grappling with the severe economic fallout of the coronavirus and the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 summer Olympics.  JUST WATCHED Japan's tourism industry braces for economic 'bloodbath' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's tourism industry braces for economic 'bloodbath' 02:37  Japanese lawmakers are mulling a massive economic stimulus package that could include cash handouts to Japanese households. The government has been widely mocked for a plan to distribute two cloth face masks per household.  Japan has imposed tough new travel restrictions -- banning foreigners from more than 70 countries, including the US, the UK, and most of Europe. Japan has also beefed up health screenings at airports and is requesting all incoming travelers quarantine for 14 days, although compliance is not actively monitored.  Yet there is growing concern -- inside and outside of the country -- that the government's increasingly dire warnings about the danger of spreading the virus may have reached many people too late.  The US Embassy in Japan posted a travel alert Friday, imploring US citizens to make preparations to go home in the wake of strengthened border control.  "The Japanese government's decision to not test broadly makes it difficult to accurately assess the Covid-19 prevalence rate," the alert said.  "While we have confidence in Japan's health care system today, we believe a significant increase in Covid-19 cases makes it difficult to predict how the system will be functioning in the coming weeks. In the event of a spike in cases, US citizens with pre-existing medical conditions may not be able to receive the medical care they have grown accustomed to in Japan prior to the Covid-19 pandemic."  Carrying on  Last week, huge crowds gathered for hanami, the viewing of the cherry blossoms. Some people were seen wearing masks, but many did not.  The startling images -- shared widely on social media and on domestic and international media -- prompted the unprecedented closures of some Tokyo parks over the weekend.  Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and Abe are pleading with the public to stay home, avoid travel, and practice social distancing. Some are listening, but many are not.  The government's policy so far has been to try to contain clusters by contract tracing positive cases and instructing suspected cases to quarantine.  Proponents of the Japanese coronavirus approach have argued the society's cultural practices -- such as bowing instead of shaking hands, widespread use of surgical face masks, and more frequent washing of the hands and mouth -- could spare Japan from the kind of rapid spread of coronavirus seen in other nations.  When asked if Japan is protected because it is not a "hug and handshake" culture, Iwata said "it is possibly one of the reasons for having less infections when compared to Europe and America."  He calls the theory "valid," but "unproven." He does not believe Japan should base its strategy on the hope that hygienic cultural practices will be enough to spare Tokyo the worst.  While Koike and Abe have urged the city's population of 13.5 million people to work from home -- advice heeded by major Japanese corporations like Honda, Toyota and Nissan -- telework is not possible for about 80% of Japanese companies, according to 2019 government data.  Scores of people are still commuting into the capital, as evidenced by packed subway trains during rush hour. And despite the temporary closure of some major Japanese department stores and around 500 Starbucks locations, many bars and restaurants remain open and full of customers.  Governor Koike announced Friday that 628 of the 750 beds Tokyo has secured for coronavirus patients are occupied, mostly by people with mild symptoms.  Health authorities are in negotiations to move patients who are asymptomatic or reasonably well to separate lodgings such as hotels, she said.  Once again, Koike warned of an impending crisis and urged people to stay at home.  The curve does not appear to be flattening in Tokyo. If anything, the situation seems to be getting worse.
2020-04-03	(CNN) Perhaps half the world's population is living under some form of restriction to help curb the spread of coronavirus. Many are starting to wonder when and how these tough limits on everyday activities will end.  Most experts agree that the only way out of a lockdown is testing. Reliable tests would allow people to know whether they have had the virus, and therefore enjoy at least a degree of immunity. They would give officials the ability to isolate new outbreaks when they emerge.  But just how would people prove their status -- and just what rights would that status confer? These are big questions that countries around the world are grappling with.  In the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock -- who has himself just emerged from self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 -- suggested that Britons who've had the virus might be issued with a certificate, which has already been dubbed an immunity passport.  "We are looking at an immunity certificate, how people who've had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity, can show that and get back as much as possible to normal life," he said. On the BBC later, he said it could take the form of a wristband.  For many who have already lost their jobs or are desperate to return to work and keep businesses alive, the idea sounds like a godsend. But little is yet known about how feasible or reliable such a scheme would be -- not least because the evidence surrounding Covid-19 immunity is not clear. "It's too early in the science of the immunity that comes from having had the disease" to take any firm decisions now, Hancock said.  Potential challenges include finding a reliable test to determine who has antibodies for the coronavirus, establishing the level of immunity conferred by previous infection and how long it lasts, and the capacity of overstretched health systems to carry out reliable, widespread antibody tests in the general population.  Difficult social questions could also be thrown up. Could immunity passports create a kind of two-tier society, where those who have them can return to a more normal life while others remain locked down?  The UK government has already been widely criticized this week over its limited coronavirus testing capacity for frontline health care workers and others, prompting skepticism about whether it could deliver a more ambitious program.  Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock is seen at the opening of the NHS Nightingale field hospital in London on Friday.  Pressed about the immunity passport idea Friday, Hancock told UK broadcaster ITV that the UK government had not so far found an antibody test that works.  The idea of immunity certificates is "a really smart one," he said. "But as yet we're not going to bring them in because we don't know yet that the immunity is strong enough and there's still more science that needs to be done about the levels of immunity in people after they've had the disease.  "So it's only when we have the confidence that that's reasonable are we going to do that."  Scientists are looking seriously at the idea, he added, including at Public Health England's laboratories at Porton Down, a top-secret government research site.  Two-tier society?  Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at England's University of East Anglia, told CNN that his first reaction on hearing Hancock's proposal was "what a brilliant idea" but that his thoughts had quickly turned to what could go wrong.  On the positive side, he said, "if you get something like this, you can get people back into areas where they are going to be meeting lots of others -- health care workers, front line workers, supermarket workers, who would otherwise be at risk but once they've had the infection know that they don't need to worry they will take the infection back to their families."  One big downside, however, is the potential for people to act fraudulently. "Could people pretend they were immune when they weren't because they needed to go out and earn money?" Hunter asked.  It's also not clear whether the antibody test, once a reliable type has been developed, would be administered at home or in a healthcare setting.  "If you are basing it on home tests, how does whoever signs your 'passport' know that you have actually read it right?" said Hunter. "How do they know that you have tested properly, read it properly, and the result is accurate? If you go somewhere else, how do they know that you are who you say you are and that you haven't swapped with someone who looks like you on your driving license?"  Another more serious issue, he said, is whether people might deliberately seek to get infected in order to -- hopefully -- recover and go back to work. "If that happens, that might undermine a lot of what we are trying to do with social distancing."  But while such an immunity passport would be divisive, the inequality wouldn't last forever, Hunter points out.  A vaccine will most likely be developed by early next year, he said, allowing those most at risk to be protected, and by then more of the population would in any case be immune.

China's color-based QR codes  The United Kingdom is not alone in grappling with the idea of how safely to end its population's confinement and get people back to work.  China, which is cautiously beginning to open back up after weeks of restrictions, is using smart phone technology to try to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus.  Residents of Hubei province, except for the city of Wuhan, were told last month that they would be allowed to leave the province if they have a green QR code on their mobile phones.  Hubei had previously ordered all its residents to obtain the color-based QR code -- which comes in red, yellow and green -- and acts as an indicator of people's health status.  The colors are assigned according to the provincial epidemic control database: people who have been diagnosed as confirmed, suspected or asymptomatic cases, or people with a fever will receive the red color code; their close contacts will receive the yellow code; and people without any record in the database will get the green code -- meaning they're healthy and safe to travel.  On April 8, the easing of restrictions will be extended to Wuhan , where the coronavirus first emerged in December, and residents with a green QR code will be able to leave the city and the province for the first time in more than two months.  Officials in the city of some 11 million residents have warned people not to go out too much, however, amid fears of a renewed wave of cases  The authorities last week introduced strict new limits on foreigners arriving in the country, in order to prevent just such a second wave.  South Korea, which has relied on aggressive testing and contact tracing to curb the coronavirus' spread, introduced a GPS-based app to make sure that people who were self-quarantined at home stayed put.  Denmark looks to testing  One European nation, Denmark, is perhaps closer than most to lifting its lockdown.  JUST WATCHED This Spanish town is taking isolation to another level Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This Spanish town is taking isolation to another level 01:28  Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Wednesday that restrictions to curb the spread of the virus appear to be working, with hospital admissions rising at a stable rate although the virus has yet to peak there.  Unforeseen developments aside, officials say the next step will be a gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April.  Part of the plan will be to offer as much testing as possible -- not just for the virus but also for antibodies -- so people may know whether or not they have acquired a level of immunity.  Since the first case was diagnosed in Denmark on February 27, more than 104 people have died and more than 535 have been hospitalized. Denmark was among the first European countries to close its borders on March 13, and in that same week closed schools, cafes and shops, as well as banning gatherings of more than 10 people and visits to hospitals.  A combination of widespread testing with social distancing seems for now to be the most reliable way to stop the virus' spread.  As Hancock told Britons, "The number one thing people can do to get out of this as fast as possible is to stay at home."
2020-04-04	Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images  President Donald Trump continued to claim hydroxychloroquine has high efficacy against Covid-19, stating lupus patients – who are commonly treated with hydroxychloroquine – are less likely to contract the virus on Saturday at a White House press briefing.  "[Hydroxychloroquine has] been out for a long time, it's a malaria drug and also a drug for lupus …There's a study out that people with lupus aren't catching this horrible virus," said Trump. "Now maybe that's correct, maybe it's false. You're going to have to check it out."  However, there is no "definitive information to be able to make any comment," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the briefing. The relationship between lupus and Covid-19 is currently being studied in "a natural history study," Fauci said.  Trump later stated he would take the medication, likely as a preventative measure, given his negative Covid-19 testing.  "But I think people should [take hydroxychloroquine]," he said. "If it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it … I have to ask my doctors about that. But I may take it."  There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent Covid-19.
2020-04-06	(CNN) Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-Min will undertake military service in South Korea during football's ongoing shutdown, his agent, Son Seung-hyuk, confirmed to CNN.  Son is currently completing two weeks of self-quarantine after returning to South Korea last month with the Premier League suspended amid the coronavirus outbreak.  The 27-year-old, who captains his national team, avoided military conscription in 2018 after winning the Asian Games with South Korea, but exempt athletes are still required by law to undertake four weeks of national service, or three weeks with the Marine Corps.  "(Son) will move to Jeju Island as soon as he has completed self-quarantine, and will receive three weeks of basic military training at the 9th Brigade of the Marine Corps beginning on April 20," said his agent.  "Basic military training in the army is usually scheduled for four weeks, but the navy (the Marine Corps) has been changed to three weeks from 2019."  Son celebrates scoring against Manchester City earlier this year.  In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged between 18 and 35 are required to complete at least 21 months of military service.

The popular boy band Big Bang, for example, was forced to take a break so members could perform military service.  However, the mandatory duty can be waived for some athletes, including those who win Olympic medals or Asian Games titles.  It was announced Friday that the Premier League season had been indefinitely suspended amid the pandemic, and that play will resume "only when it is safe and appropriate to do so."  Son underwent surgery after fracturing his arm against Aston Villa in February; at the time, Tottenham said he would be sidelined for a number of weeks.  He has scored nine goals and recorded seven assists in the Premier League this season, with Spurs eighth in the table.
2020-04-06	CNN's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Our sponsorship policy .  (CNN) In 1975, Vietnam emerged from its 20-year-long war as one of the poorest nations in the world.  Since then, its economy has been transformed -- largely thanks to a package of economic and political reforms, designed to engineer growth, that was launched by the government in 1986.  More than 45 million people were lifted out of poverty between 2002 and 2018 as the country developed industries that span textiles, agriculture, furniture, plastics, paper, tourism and telecommunications.  Vietnam is now undergoing another transformation -- thanks to technology.  Smartphones are changing the way of life in Vietnam.  New infrastructure has given Vietnamese citizens easy access to the internet -- and propelled their country across the digital divide.  A 2018 report by Google and Singaporean investment company Temasek described Vietnam's digital economy -- which is growing at more than 40% a year -- as "a dragon being unleashed."  It's not all plain sailing. Vietnam's government has been widely criticized for its surveillance of citizens and restrictions on freedom of speech. And like the rest of the world, it's impossible to predict how the coronavirus will impact the country's economy.  What's clear, though, is that technology is reshaping the way people in Vietnam do business, manufacture goods, entertain themselves, shop, organize their finances and communicate. CNN spoke to three business leaders -- to take the pulse of a changing nation.  The startup pioneer  Nguyen Thuy Lien, head of corporate development for Appota  Nguyen Thuy Lien.  One of the country's most dynamic startups, Appota has hitched its wagon to the growth of Vietnam's smartphone market.  Appota, which launched in 2011, has around 40 million users on its "digital ecosystem," says head of corporate development, Nguyen Thuy Lien. The company publishes games licensed from developers in China (martial arts themes are especially popular) and has developed an e-wallet for gaming purchases. Its apps include a wifi password-sharing facility, a book reader, news, movies, comics and other forms of entertainment.  "Vietnamese of all ages love their smartphones" says Nguyen. "Everything Appota does is through mobile."  A 2019 report by Google and the Mobile Marketing Association identified Vietnam as a "mobile-first market" with "over 51 million smartphones, representing over 80% of the population aged 15-years and older."  Network coverage is extensive. "People get access to 3G and 4G even in rural and mountainous areas," says Nguyen, adding that handsets and tariffs are competitively-priced.  The company also operates a business-to-business advertising arm and is looking to expand its mobile payments operations.  Nguyen is responsible for securing funding for Appota -- which has raised $17 million to date. She says that attracting investment is easier now than it was in the past, with the majority of funds coming in from overseas, especially Japan and South Korea. Vietnamese investors, however, tend to lack confidence in tech, she says. "They are more conservative and prefer putting money into real estate."  Appota's next foray will be into physical products -- which function via smartphones. The company recently launched a "smart lock," operated by an app, that secures everything from front doors to suitcases. Nguyen says her company's vision is to fully integrate smartphones into the workplace and the home. "It's the next step in digital transformation."  The sustainability trailblazer  Hans Barkell-Schmitz, assistant to the chairman, Royal Spirit Group  Hans Barkell-Schmitz at the DBW factory.  A manufacturing powerhouse, Vietnam is the world's third largest exporter of textiles and garments (after China and Bangladesh).  But the global textile industry is highly polluting, churning through more than 90 billion cubic meters of water a year, and contributing around 10 percent of global carbon emissions.  Hong Kong-based garment manufacturer Royal Spirit Group opened the Deutsche BekleidungsWerke factory (its name reflects the company's German heritage) on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, in 2016. "We decided to position ourselves at the forefront of sustainability," says Hans Barkell-Schmitz, who conceived and led the project.  DBW from the air. The roof is fitted out with solar panels and a garden, and is painted with light-reflecting paint.  Known as DBW, the $20-million facility is designed to sustain both the environment and the 1,000-strong workforce. The chairs were designed locally to fit the average Vietnamese body size, says Barkell-Schmitz. Throughout the factory, LED lights glow at the optimal level to reduce eye strain and headaches, and complex calculations were used to set the ventilation and air conditioning systems at the right temperatures. "Our ethos is -- if we have a happy workforce, we'll have more efficiency and it's a win-win" says Barkell-Schmitz.  Cutting energy consumption was key. The factory runs on renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, biofuel and solar, says Barkell-Schmitz. His team chose equipment with "great care," he says, comparing the energy use of different options. They selected German sewing machines that automatically switch off when not stitching, and machines that make and apply pockets with minimal waste and electricity consumption.  DBW's ironing and sewing machines use much less electricity than conventional machines.  The factory is equipped with "highly technical dyeing machines that use less dye and water," says Barkell-Schmitz. The building itself acts as a giant funnel, channeling rainwater into tanks -- which is then filtered and used to wash textiles. The factory also incorporates a "gray water system" in which handwashing and dishwashing water is filtered and re-used to nourish a rooftop garden that produces fruit and vegetables for the factory cafeteria.  According to Barkell-Schmitz, the single biggest challenge was the paperwork. By planning and documenting all aspects of the project according to stringent requirements, DBW earned top level awards from both LEED, the US green building certification system, and Lotus, its counterpart in Vietnam.  Barkell-Schmitz hopes that DBW will inspire other manufacturers. "It's a win for the planet, for the companies which invest, and for the consumers."

In 2010 Tran Ngoc Thai Son launched his company, Tiki, in his bedroom at his parents' house in Ho Chi Minh City. An online bookseller specializing in English-language titles, he used the family garage as a warehouse. "It was a tiny store, but my dream was very big," says Tran.  Ten years later, Tiki is the one of the top e-commerce platforms in Vietnam, says Tran. It sells a vast array of consumer goods with an average of 17 million customer visits, and around 4.5 million items shipped, per month.  Tiki's expansion has tracked explosive growth in Vietnam's e-commerce market, which was worth $6.2 billion in 2019.  This boom reflects, in part, the youthfulness and increasing affluence of Vietnam's population, says Tran. The Vietnamese embrace new technology and feel optimistic about the future, "which drives them to go online and buy stuff," he says.  Additionally, smartphones and internet access are extremely affordable, says Tran, while fierce competition between international conglomerates and local startups "drives innovation and consumer benefits."

2020-04-06	(CNN) The mother of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has died after contracting coronavirus, the club confirmed on Monday.  On its official Twitter account , City said that Dolors Sala Carrió, 82, had passed away near Barcelona, Spain.  "Everyone associated with the club sends their most heartfelt sympathy at this most distressing time to Pep, his family and all their friends," read a succeeding tweet.  Guardiola had previously donated €1 million ($1.08 million) to the fight against the virus, helping fund the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and the Medical College of Barcelona.  The College said the donation would go towards the purchase and supply of medical and protective equipment for doctors fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.
2020-04-06	During Monday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump claimed that the Paycheck Protection Program -- a small businesses lending program -- has “really been performing well.”  Trump said there were a few “minor glitches that have already been taken care of.”  Facts First: CNN has reported significant issues to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with system wide failures as lenders process these loans.  Days after the launch of the Small Business Administration's rollout of the PPP, there are still delays in the system lenders use to upload loan application information and the money is still largely not going out to the businesses that need it yet.  According to an industry source who spoke to CNN, major system-wide failures continue to crop up in the PPP system, including shutdowns preventing the submission of applications from lenders on their system known as E-Tran. These issues have slowed down the ability for banks to participate in the loan program, this source tells CNN.  Additionally, several bank executives tell CNN they want the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration to offer more guidance on how they are supposed to disburse funds. CNN reporting indicates there are also concerns among lenders who say they won’t cut checks until there is clear guidance on how they should distribute the money.

2020-04-06	(CNN) Up until last week, official guidance suggested that presumptively healthy people didn't need to be wearing masks. Now, that has changed. In this episode, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains the new recommendations.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Our second episode ever — which, if you can believe it, aired just a month ago -- was all about masks. On March 3, we told you that, if you appear to be healthy, you probably don't need to be wearing a mask. At that time, that was the advice from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC has now issued new guidance recommending that even people who are not displaying symptoms of Covid-19 should cover their faces in public when they cannot maintain social distancing, in places like grocery stores and pharmacies. The change was announced by President Trump at a briefing on Friday, and we want to make sure you know why and have the latest information about keeping yourself and others safe.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is "Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."  Part of what inspired the CDC's new guidance on masks is a letter by a panel of prestigious scientists that warned Covid-19 may be spread through talking or even breathing -- not just coughing or sneezing.  In some ways, we've known this for a long time. It is the essence of asymptomatic spread: spreading without symptoms.  Dr. Harvey Fineberg, one of the scientists who sent the letter to the White House last week, said he would start wearing a mask when he goes to the grocery store. Here he is on CNN.  Dr. Fineberg: What we know about respiratory viruses is that they are spread by visible droplets and tiny invisible droplets and then even tinier aerosol that can be in the air. And there have been studies of all three modalities to show that they are produced by humans. Breathing: Some of us put out many more aerosols than others when we breathe. By talking, especially when we use something like a T or a P. And also, just by singing, coughing, sneezing. All the things that produce visible spray. All of these modalities can carry virus.  Dr. Gupta: Fineberg's letter pointed to the growing body of evidence about the role of asymptomatic people.  It's still not clear just how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in the spread of the disease. But the CDC now recommends that everyone cover their face as a precaution. It is to keep you from spreading the disease, not necessarily to protect you from getting the disease.  As I've said before, we should all behave as if we have the virus.  Just two days after Fineberg's letter was sent to the White House, the President announced the CDC's new guidelines.  Trump: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you'd have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.  Dr. Gupta: Before Trump's announcement, local governments in cities like Los Angeles, Laredo, Texas, and New York City had already recommended that citizens wear some form of face covering.  Again, the purpose of a mask is not to protect yourself, so much as to protect others from you. Homemade masks like scarves or bandanas won't filter out all potentially harmful droplets, but they'll reduce the potentially harmful droplets that you're expelling.  In his announcement about new mask guidelines, Trump emphasized that the average person who isn't displaying symptoms of Covid-19 does not need a surgical or respirator mask. Those should be reserved for health care workers on the front lines.  Because of the shortage of medical-grade masks, President Trump announced separately last week that he had invoked the defense production act to bolster the supply chain and get more masks and ventilators to those in need.  Trump: We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future. In addition to the one that I have just signed against 3M for face masks. We just signed an element of the act against 3M. And hopefully they'll be able to do what they are supposed to do.  Dr. Gupta: 3M is the world's largest manufacturer of respirator masks. The company 3M is the world's largest manufacturer of respirator masks. The company said in response that it is working to comply with President Trump's order to ramp up mask production.  Equipment shortages have hindered the United States response to Covid-19, prompting health care workers across the country to publicly beg for protective gear.  CNN Investigative Correspondent Drew Griffin: Many medical workers are fighting this battle without the thinnest level of protection ... that could mean the difference between treating the infected and becoming one of them.  Dr. Gupta: The lack of an adequate stockpile and global supply chain disruptions have contributed to this issue, but so have individual hoarders.  Just last week, the Department of Health and Human Services redistributed almost 200,000 medical grade N95 masks and other medical supplies seized by the FBI from a man in Brooklyn.  There is no need to hoard anything. Not masks -- not toilet paper. But now, cover your face when you leave your house if you're going to be in a public setting where it's difficult to maintain social distance. To be fair, the general consensus is that it is not exactly clear how much this will help, but it certainly won't hurt.  I asked White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci about the optics of masks last week, before the Trump administration had issued any new guidance.  Dr. Fauci: So if everybody wears a mask, does that look like we're all frightened of each other? But, you know, the people in Asia have been doing that long before coronavirus and it's become part of their culture. I mean, is it good? Is it bad? I think it's neither. It's neither good nor bad. They've just integrated that into their culture. And, you know, as I said, I cannot imagine it's doing harm and it might be doing some good.  Dr. Gupta: In fact, mask-wearing in countries like Taiwan, South Korea and China may have contributed to lower infection rates and rapid containment of outbreaks in those countries. A 2004 study of the transmission of SARS in Beijing found that consistently wearing a mask in public could reduce risk of contracting SARS by 70%.  Results like that are what make the conflicting guidance on masks so confusing. At the briefing where the new guidance was announced, Surgeon General Jerome Adams acknowledged the back and forth over mask wearing.  Surgeon General Adams: I want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing.  Dr. Gupta: In February, Adams had tweeted a plea for people to stop buying masks so there would be enough for health care workers. Many people wondered at the time, if health care workers needed them, why didn't the rest of us? Here's Dr. Adams on Friday.  Dr. Adams: We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms. ... CDC is always, always looking at the data ... and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates.  Dr. Gupta: Dr. Adams also gave instructions for how best to use a face covering.  Dr. Adams: I want to say, if you do choose to wear a face mask, very important, wash your hands first because you don't want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand. Do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again you could take materials from the surface, germs from the surface and bring it to your face. If you choose to wear a face covering, please, please leave the N95 mask, the medical supplies, for the medical professionals, health care workers, and front-line workers.  Dr. Gupta: The bottom line is this: Yes, the official recommendations have changed. This has been an evolution. We're all continuing to live and learn. But for now, cover your face when you go out in public. Stay home as much as you can. Maintain a social distance.  And if you need inspiration for your face covering, or you want to make your own, you can take a page out of my daughter's book. She's been using her own sewing machine to make masks out of cloth. You can find instructions for how to do this at CNN.com  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.

2020-04-06	Hong Kong (CNN Business) Samsung, the world's largest smartphone maker, predicts it eked out a rise in profit last quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic was just beginning to disrupt supply chains and hobble global demand.  The South Korean company said on Tuesday that it expects to make an operating profit of roughly 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) for the January-to-March period. That's up nearly 3% from the same period a year ago and right in line with what analysts polled by data provider Refinitiv predicted.  Samsung said it expects sales will also rise about 5% to 55 trillion won ($45 billion).  Shares in Samsung rose about 2% in Seoul on the news, though later pared gains to 1.4%.  The company will report full first-quarter results at the end of this month.  Read More
2020-04-06	New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump has not fully shut down the American economy out of fear it will deal a devastating financial blow. But that reluctance could ultimately exacerbate the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic.  Trump has largely left it up to the governors to issue stay-at-home orders aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Many, but not all, US states have done so.  Bank of America is warning that the United States, as well as Europe, has failed to learn the lessons from the success of more aggressive shutdowns ordered by governments in Asia.  "The US health policy response has been slower and weaker," Bank of America economists wrote in a report published late last week. "The end result of these delays is a much bigger and longer shock."  The shock has already been staggering. More than 10,000 people have died from coronavirus complications in the United States.  The economy is on pace to suffer an historic collapse this quarter. Millions of jobs have been lost. Unemployment could temporarily spike to "depression" levels , former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen warned Monday.  "This is a huge, unprecedented and devastating hit," Yellen said on CNBC  'Ineffective response' from the United States  Bank of America, citing an "ineffective response" from the US and other governments, is warning that hit will likely get worse.  The bank significantly downgraded its 2020 GDP outlook for the United States, calling for a plunge of 6%, compared with 0.8% previously. And it now expects a global recession that will be "considerably worse" than the Great Recession.  "Only this week did the Trump Administration admit to the scale of the problem and there is still not a consistent, aggressive national policy," the bank said in its report, published last Thursday.  Here's the problem: Economists say the experience in China, South Korea and other countries in Asia showed that the most effective policy is a strict lockdown at the national level. Yet Trump has refused to issue such an order.  "If a full shutdown is needed to bend the curve, then the weeks of partial shutdown are largely wasted," the Bank of America report said.  And if those weeks are wasted, that will only drag out the impact on the economy and on human life. Each week of the shutdown cuts nearly 9% from quarter-over-quarter annualized GDP growth, the report said.  "For the economy, a delay means a rapid increase in the cost," the economists said.  New York peaking?  US stocks surged Monday on glimmers of hope in the fight against coronavirus. The Dow spiked more than 1,100 points, or roughly 5%, on signs that the virus could be peaking in New York , the epicenter of the crisis in the United States. Hospitalizations in New York have also sharply declined over the past three days.  "This is great news and seems to confirm the intuitive success of social distancing efforts," Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman wrote in a Monday note to clients.  But there is reason to believe that the national picture could yet get worse before it gets better.  "In the United States, trends continue to deteriorate," Matthew Harrison, a biotech analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report to clients Monday. "Mortality is growing exponentially and new 'hot spots' are developing in the interior of the country."  Morgan Stanley: Social distancing for another 70+ days  The problem, according to Harrison, is the US response to the coronavirus pandemic.  "We would expect it to take longer in the US given the social distancing measures are not as robust," Harrison wrote. "The containment measures continue to not be as strict as China which has delayed the time to peak."  Morgan Stanley expects the United States to experience two peaks, one for coastal regions in around two weeks and then a second peak in the interior. The ultimate apex for the nation may not happen until mid-May.  As a result, the US economy may not enjoy a rapid reopening like the one Trump envisions and that many Americans are hoping for.  Social distancing measures are "unlikely to start to recede" for about 70 days from now, Harrison said, and these restrictions will likely "wax and wane as hot spots develop over the next 1-2 years."  Some states have not issued stay-at-home orders  The federal government has taken several other steps aimed at addressing the pandemic, including building temporary hospitals in New York City, sending ships to act as floating hospitals and working with US states to help secure badly needed medical equipment.  "We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens," Trump said during Sunday's press briefing.  Trump acknowledged that the next week or two will be very difficult: "There'll be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn't done."  Eight governors have refused to issue statewide stay-at home orders -- even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said these orders are the most effective way to stop the virus.  Trump has said he wants to leave it up to governors to decide what happens in their states.  "They're doing very well, and they're doing a magnificent job in running their states," Trump said during a press briefing.  More aggressive financial response  The good news is that Washington has mounted a forceful financial response to coronavirus.  That response should help blunt the economic damage caused by the coronavirus and hopefully set the stage for a more rapid recovery. But before that can happen, the health crisis must end.
2020-04-07	Hong Kong (CNN) As the United States military was embroiled in controversy over its handling of an outbreak of coronavirus on one of its Pacific aircraft carriers , China was resuming operations in the South China Sea.  In the past week, the English language website of the People's Liberation Army has posted stories on large-scale naval exercises and the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat . In addition, it also announced the ramping up of military industries in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The South China Sea drills came after the US aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt passed through those waters on its way to Guam, where it is now docked after more than 170 cases of coronavirus have been reported aboard the ship.  Trump says it was inappropriate of commander to write memo  Trump says it was inappropriate of commander to write memo 01:32  Trump says it was inappropriate of commander to write memo  The Roosevelt's commander, Capt. Brett Crozier, was stripped of his command last week after a memo he wrote warning that urgent action was needed to protect the lives of his crew was leaked to the media.  The US Navy's other aircraft carrier in the Pacific, the USS Ronald Reagan, is also facing a "handful" of positive cases, a defense official told CNN last week. That ship is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, undergoing maintenance.  Late last week, a second US Navy installation in Japan, Sasebo Naval Base, reported its first case of coronavirus. Other virus cases have been reported at US installations in South Korea.  In total the US Defense Department reports more than 1,500 coronavirus cases within its ranks.  The Pentagon has taken steps to control the spread of the virus within the services, including stopping the movement of troops between installations worldwide and canceling training exercises and even delaying some basic training for recruits.  All that comes at a cost, including weariness among troops who were expecting to be rotated back to the States, or lack of familiarity with missions or equipment because training cannot take place.  Changing strategies  Jonathan Hoffman, US assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, told reporters last week the Pentagon makes daily risk assessments with an eye to regaining "full operational capability more quickly."  But some analysts have suggested that in the South China Sea, even short-term pullbacks can create an opening the PLA could take advantage of.

MUST WATCH Defense secretary defends removal of Navy captain 03:32  "I think China is exploiting the US Navy's coronavirus challenges to improve its position in the South China Sea by giving the appearance it can and will operate there at will while the US is hamstrung," said Carl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.  China claims almost the entire 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory, and it has aggressively asserted its stake in recent years in the face of conflicting claims from several Southeast Asian nations. The US has long accused Beijing of militarizing islands there via the deployment of military hardware and construction of military facilities.  Schuster used the recent sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat to illustrate how China will push its position.  The fishing boat sank last Thursday in water near the Paracels, also known as the Xisha islands, in the northern part of the sea. Both China and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the island group.  China said the boat sank after it rammed a China Coast Guard vessel that intercepted it in Chinese waters. Vietnam said its fishing boat was operating legally and blamed the sinking on the Chinese. Both sides acknowledge the fishing boat's crew was rescued by the Chinese ship.  Many analysts have noted that Vietnam appears to moving closer to the US as a result of tensions in the South China Sea. In fact, the Roosevelt was on a port visit to Da Nang before the coronavirus cases turned up on board.  The five-day port visit in early March, only the second by a US aircraft carrier to Vietnam since the Vietnam War, was in commemoration of 25 years of US-Vietnam diplomatic relations. It involved cultural and sports exchanges as well as, ironically, a professional exchange focused on cooperating on infectious disease prevention.  However, Schuster noted that the incident with the fishing boat may send a message to Hanoi that "it has cozied up to the US at a time when the US is not in a position to respond to Chinese actions."  In a story posted on its English-language website Friday, the PLA said that "the outbreak of Covid-19 has significantly lowered the US Navy's warship deployment capability in the Asia-Pacific region."  Aircraft carriers, with their complement of 90 warplanes and helicopters, are the US Navy's most visible and among its most imposing assets.  But with the Roosevelt quarantined in Guam for an indefinite period, it is unclear how easily it can be replaced in its South China Sea role. While the US has 11 aircraft carriers in its fleet, the nuclear-powered ships require extensive overhauls and long-term maintenance at regular intervals, making few available to deploy at any one time.  The US Naval Institute's fleet tracker showed only five carriers available as of March 30. One of those is the Roosevelt, another is the Reagan, two others are deployed in to the Persian Gulf to respond to possible threat from Iran and the fifth is on the US East Coast.  Moving a carrier from one spot on the world's oceans to another can leave vulnerabilities in the area it departed.  According to Schuster, the perception that US readiness has been impacted could embolden China, as to carry out an increased number of exercises in the South China Sea, such as those carried out in March.  'Not a geopolitical weapon'  China has consistently pushed back at the suggestion it is attempting to use the pandemic to gain geopolitical influence.  At at press briefing on April 3, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, described the spread of the virus as a war. "(But) when fighting an intense battle, does anyone think of how much prize they will get after the war? The most important thing is doing your best and racing against time to achieve the final victory," said Hua.  JUST WATCHED CNN's rare view of contested South China Sea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN's rare view of contested South China Sea 02:43  "We would like to share China's good practice and experience with other countries, but we will not turn it into any kind of geopolitical weapon or tool," she added.  The US State Department has taken issue with that. In a statement Monday, spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called the incident with the Vietnamese fishing boat just "the latest in a long string of PRC (People's Republic of China) actions to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea."  "We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic, and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea," the statement said.  Meanwhile, the PLA has consistently maintained that it doesn't face the same kind of coronavirus concerns the US does, noting a month ago that not a single soldier, sailor or airman had been infected with Covid-19.  There is widespread international skepticism about that claim. But according to Schuster, China enjoys some advantages in controlling, or at least concealing, the number of infections it has in its naval forces.  While the US Navy fleet is scattered across the Pacific, far from its home shores and operating longer patrols, most PLA Navy ships are at sea under 30 days at a time and operating close to their bases, said Schuster, enabling them to "replace known infected crewmen off the ship with known healthy sailors from other ship."

2020-04-07	(CNN) Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.  Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.  Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.  1. Shortness of breath  Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.  "If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.  "If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added.  The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen.  Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.  2. Fever  Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.  "I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.  Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).  "There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.  "We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."  Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.  "Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained.  "One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever."  3. Dry Cough  Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.  "It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained.  The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.  "It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added.  report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.  4. Chills and body aches  "The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.  'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.  "I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said.  Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.  One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.  5. Sudden confusion  Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.  6. Digestive issues  At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.  "In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.  Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.  The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.  7. Pink eye  Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.  Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.  But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.  Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.  8. Loss of smell and taste  In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.  "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.  "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones."  "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.  A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.  Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.  9. Fatigue  For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.  Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.  "I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360 . "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours."  Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.  10. Headache, sore throat, congestion  The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.  Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.  Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.  So what should you do?  "At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.

That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.  It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.  In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.  "Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises.  To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.  "People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said.  A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.  How to be evaluated  If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.  "We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue," Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. "However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated."  If you do have those three signs, where should you go?  "If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients," Harris said.  "If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers," Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.  "If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly," Schaffer said. "It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do."
2020-04-07	Tokyo (CNN) Much of Japan will enter a state of emergency Tuesday, as the country struggles to rein in the coronavirus pandemic, months after the first domestic cases were reported .  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that "basic economic activity" will continue in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka, the seven affected prefectures, with public transport and supermarkets remaining open, but urged people to exercise social distancing and avoid unnecessary trips.  The state of emergency, which is expected to be formally announced at a press conference Tuesday,will last for approximately one month. The declaration comes as Japan reported 252 new cases of the coronavirus and seven more deaths Monday, bringing the total number of infections to over 4,600, with 91 deaths.  Abe has faced criticism for not activating emergency measures earlier , as experts warned the true number of cases could be far higher than the official statistics suggest, due to a lack of widespread testing.  Growing concerns  The Japanese capital Tokyo is among one of the country's worst hit areas, and on Monday doctors in the city declared a state of medical emergency , citing a possible collapse of the healthcare system.  Ozaki Haruo, president of the Tokyo Medical Association, told reporters Monday that the rising number of coronavirus cases could result in a shortage of beds and the spreading of the virus within hospitals, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.  When this happens, medical staff will be unable to provide services to critically ill patients, Ozaki said, adding that the next six weeks will be critical in preventing an "explosive spread" of the virus.  Japan only has seven intensive care beds for every 100,000 people, a fifth of the proportion available in the US.  Part of the problem is that authorities had previously been urging anyone with symptoms to go to hospital, putting additional strain on the health care system. However, Dr. Yoshihiro Takayama, an infectious diseases specialist at Okinawa Chubu Hospital, said that the authorities are preparing to shift to a new policy of requiring those with mild symptoms to "self-isolate at home."  Takayama was concerned however that the number of cases could be far greater than it appears from the official statistics, due to the paucity of testing nationwide.  As of last week, Japan had only conducted some 30,000 tests, compared with almost 400,000 carried out in neighboring South Korea.  "In some cases, the number of patients may be several times, or could be ten times more. I think it is necessary to use such imagination and prepare the medical system to deal with it," Takayama said. "The battle has only just begun."  The country is also facing a potential shortage of ventilators for the worst affected. As of February, Japan was estimated to have more than 22,000 ventilators, for a population of over 126 million, according to a report in NHK.  At least 40% of those ventilators are already in use, as officials scramble to ramp up production and source new machines from overseas.

MUST WATCH Japan's tourism industry braces for economic 'bloodbath' 02:37  Slow response  Japan, with strong economic and transport links to China, was among the first countries to report cases of the coronavirus. For a long time, an outbreak on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama, was the worst outside mainland China.  Despite this long exposure to the virus, the country has been slow to take the kind of radical steps seen in many other parts of the world, and officials have faced accusations of deliberately dragging their feet to avoid greater damage to the economy after the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, which is expected to cause a big hit  But experts have warned that the failure to respond quickly could result in a far worse situation.  "Japan needs to have the courage to change, when we are aware we are on the wrong path," said Kentaro Iwata, an infection control specialist from Kobe University, who has repeatedly warned that Japan isn't doing enough to halt the spread of the virus. "We might see the next New York City in Tokyo."  Iwata said that the situation in the Japanese capital is comparable to that in New York, Spain and Italy just before they saw explosions in the number of cases, and he called on the government to conduct more widespread testing in order to get an idea of the true number of infections.  The Japanese government says its testing regime is adequate and suitably targeted to high risk cases.  "Testing people with a low probability of novel coronavirus would be a waste of resources," Japan's Health Ministry told CNN in a statement. "We ask people with some symptoms to stay home for a period of time."  A government panel warned last week that hospitals and medical clinics in Tokyo, Aichi, Kanagawa, Osaka and Hyogo were already stretched and that "drastic countermeasures need to be taken as quickly as possible."
2020-04-07	Alex Brandon/AP  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that he knows "for a fact" that the United States doesn’t actually have the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, saying it's simply testing more than any other country -- a comment the coordinator of his White House coronavirus task force later clarified.  "I think the reporting here has been pretty straight-forward for the past five – six weeks," Dr. Deborah Birx told reporters. "Prior to that, when there wasn’t testing in January and February, that’s a very different situation and unknown.”  Earlier in the press conference, Trump said that "America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world, and I think that’s probably why we have more cases."  "Because you look at some these very large countries," he continued, "I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do, but they don’t report them."  Per capita, countries like Italy and South Korea have done more testing than the United States by far. Many experts believe that the number of coronavirus cases in the US is likely higher than reported due to problems with testing availability.  Birx elaborated there may have been early deaths in the US that were not counted as coronavirus related, but perhaps should have been.  Birx said some countries don’t consider coronavirus to be the cause of death in some individuals with pre-existing conditions.  “There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition, and let’s say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem, some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid-19 death.”  “The intent is right now,” she said, “if someone dies with Covid-19, we are counting that as a Covid-19 death.”  She later conceded that some rural areas might not “have the same level of testing.”
2020-04-07	Dr. Terence Kealey is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a professor of clinical biochemistry at the University of Buckingham in the United Kingdom, where he served as vice chancellor until 2014. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) South Korea, the US and the UK all reported their first Covid-19 cases around the same time: on January 20 , January 21 , and January 31 , respectively. How things unfolded from there, unfortunately for the US and UK, has been strikingly different.  Today, South Korea is reporting less than 100 new cases a day, the UK is reporting around 4,000 new cases a day, and the US is reporting around 30,000. But while numbers in South Korea have fallen, in the US and UK they have been rising exponentially (around 20,000 new cases a day a week ago, about 8,000 new cases a day a week before that). We don't yet know if the exponential rise in the US has been halted or not, or whether the figure will plateau at around 30,000 new cases a day.  Nonetheless, the great success story is South Korea, and we know how they did it: they tested.  On December 31, 2019, Chinese officials informed the World Health Organization they had identified an unknown pneumonia, and on January 10, with impressive speed, Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang of Fudan University, Shanghai, published the virus's RNA sequence . (An RNA sequence can be used as the basis of a diagnostic test.)  By February 4, Kogene Biotech of Seoul had not only developed one but had also had it approved by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). And by February 10, was reporting its findings on the first 2,776 people to have been tested.  At that point, there were only 27 confirmed cases in South Korea, so -- in another impressive demonstration of speed -- the South Korean authorities tested each of them and, more importantly, isolated those who tested positive and monitored their contacts.  Initially, the authorities were swamped by the numbers of people who needed testing, but South Korean officials have tested contacts of those who have been infected. The authorities have made tests freely available and set up drive-in stations, modeled on McDonald's and Starbucks for anyone to use. Those who tested positive were then isolated, with the result that the epidemic was swiftly controlled without the country as a whole needing to be shut down.  In the US and many other countries, however, a lack of testing kits prohibited the identification and isolation of individuals, so whole populations and whole economies have had to close down instead. By comparison, South Korea has been spared that fate partly by the government's response and partly by the swift reaction of its biotech industry.  Yet the US and many of its peers could have been prepared.  President Barack Obama, for example, had established the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense within the National Security Council, specifically to anticipate pandemics such as Covid-19. But two years ago, the Trump administration forced out the directorate's leadership and fused its rump into a new directorate for counterproliferation.  Asked if the novel coronavirus had prompted him to reconsider his support for cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization, President Trump replied , "I'm a business person -- I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly."  Yet the people who can tell Trump when he needs them are the very people he doesn't like having around. If you wait for doctors by the bedsides to tell you lots of people have fallen ill, it's too late to prevent a disease from becoming a pandemic.  Trump's lack of seriousness, compared with South Korean President Moon Jae-in's, has been pointed.  On January 30, President Moon was saying that preventative "measures should be strong enough to the point of being considered excessive." Trump, on the other hand, spent most of February saying the disease was no more of a threat than the flu, that it would suddenly disappear, and would later blame the "Fake News media" for criticism of his response.  Britain under Boris Johnson has been as insouciant. Johnson advocated striking a balance between restrictive measures and a strategy of "taking it on the chin," under which increasing numbers of people would become infected until the virus would "move through the population."  But, as the interviewers protested during the very interview at which Johnson revealed his strategy, his policy was bound to fail because Britain's hospitals, under its single-payer National Health Service, lacked the capacity to handle the influx.  In pursuit of efficiency, Britain's hospitals have little spare capacity , and it would take very few extra patients to swamp them. As, indeed, swiftly came to pass: Britain has instituted a virtual lockdown nationwide, while the US has issued federal guidelines on social distancing but continues to operate under a patchwork of state and local orders on what kinds of businesses can remain open and whether citizens can gather.  Neither has gone as far as China's lockdown in Wuhan , which included a ban on travel in and out of the area, unless citizens were rated as safe to move about by a phone app that tracked likelihood of infectious contact."  South Korea was sensitive to the dangers of the virus because of the country's experience with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which spread in 2002 and 2003) and MERS (the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus of the 2015 South Korean outbreak).  In establishing the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense within the National Security Council, Obama evidently had hoped to preempt future pandemics, bringing US policy closer in line with more-prepared countries like South Korea. But perhaps he was flouting human nature. Perhaps we're not very good, as a species, in learning from the experiences of others.  In the 1722 "Journal of the Plague Year," describing the bubonic plague in London in 1665, Daniel Defoe wrote of "the Supine Negligence of the People themselves, who during the long Notice, or Warning, they had of the Visitation, yet made no Provision for it." When Trump recently said that Covid-19 was something "you can never really think is going to happen," he may have been speaking for anyone who resists preparing for abstract dangers.  The British populist politician Michael Gove in 2016 spoke for similar swaths in the UK when he declared that "people in this country have had enough of experts." Yet the one politician who has come out this crisis well is President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who listened very carefully to the experts. There may be a lesson there.

2020-04-07	(CNN) Jersey City Councilman Michael Yun, a longtime civic and business leader in the community, has died from complications of the coronavirus, according to his chief of staff, Vernon Richardson.  City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted the news of Yun's death on Monday, saying, "It's w/a heavy heart that we share that Councilman Yun has passed away. He was a great co worker and a tireless advocate for the people of #JerseyCity -- More than that he was a great father, husband and grandfather. I can speak for the entire JC community that we are devastated."  It's w/a heavy heart that we share that Councilman Yun has passed away.

2020-04-08	Outdoor meeting places used for recreation in Nevada will be closed until further notice in order to curb the spread of Covid-19, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday.  The order includes public gyms, swimming pools and golf courses. Sisolak said people can continue to play sports on their own private property.  Additionally, as most Christian denominations begin to celebrate the Easter week, Sisolak is prohibiting public worship services, except those that can be done with no more than 10 people.  “This wasn’t easy,” Gov. Sisolak said in a Wednesday news conference. “In these trying times, I have clung to my faith to guide me.”  The new Nevada orders also close retail showrooms for businesses like car dealerships and furniture stores.  Sisolak said these areas “encourage customers to wander around and touch products, and that sort of shopping experience can lead to a higher likelihood of spreading the disease.”  Although grocery stores can continue to operate as essential businesses, they can no longer sell food on open display, such as salad bars, bulk candy and freshly-ground coffee.
2020-04-08	Washington (CNN) Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday said it would not be feasible to relax current measures to combat the spread of coronavirus without a "robust system of testing and monitoring — something we have yet to put in place nationwide."  The tweet presents a notable contrast in tone compared to the views of President Donald Trump , who on Wednesday morning tweeted that the country's economy must reopen "sooner rather than later" and that the pandemic "must be quickly forgotten" for those who haven't lost a loved one. But coronavirus testing is still not widely available, limiting the ability to relax current social distancing guidelines to prevent a resurgence of the virus.  "Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring -- something we have yet to put in place nationwide," Obama wrote in a tweet Wednesday morning.  Guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that "decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians," and Trump has not floated the idea of a national system for testing and monitoring people stricken with the virus, like China and South Korea are doing.  There are nearly 400,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, and nearly 13,000 Americans have died, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.
2020-04-08	Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates took to LinkedIn on Wednesday to discuss coronavirus. "This scenario was a nightmare I was worried about," he said during a livestream. He referred to his previous talks calling for more preparation in case of a pandemic.  "The US unfortunately let a level of infections come in in February that meant that we couldn't be like Taiwan or South Korea in terms of catching it early and never having a large number of cases," said Gates. "So we've had to do very drastic measures to get the number of cases down."  He said that a number of places across the United States have done well in implementing stay at home measures. "It’s a mistake not to have the entire country take these extreme measures," he said. "It's understandable that people find this shocking."  Gates also predicted it would take the world about 18 months to recover, as that's the timeline for a potential vaccine. "Until you’ve got that vaccine widely used, life will still be not back to normal," he said, adding that things might be semi-normal by June. But he expects large public gatherings still likely won't be allowed.  Responding to a LinkedIn user's question about whether the economy could recover its lost jobs, Gates said: "The government did not do its duty to prepare for this well in advance but now people are focused on it and we can see different countries responding in different ways."
2020-04-09	Washington (CNN) On April 4, Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York heard that the Suffolk County stockpile of masks, gowns, face shields and body bags was empty.  So that Saturday night, Zeldin tweeted a plea to his followers and within minutes received a response from Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser, who asked him about the burn rate of medical supplies for the past 30 days and the expected demand for the next.  The next day, Trump announced the administration would send 200,000 N95 masks to the county encompassing much of Long Island, New York, one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  "I get a phone call from someone who is a nurse at a local hospital, and they're telling me about how they're wearing the same N95 mask for two weeks," Zeldin said. "There's few things that can possibly motivate me more in my entire time in Congress to deliver a specific item than hearing a story like that."  After rushing to pass the largest US economic stimulus in history , rank-and-file members of Congress are serving as the conduit between hospitals and protective medical supplies, the unemployed and their next paycheck, small businesses and the loans they need to survive.  The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 400,000 Americans. More than 13,000 have succumbed to the disease. Millions have lost their jobs while businesses, schools and churches have closed. The stock market has tanked.  The twin economic and health care crises have struck all parts of the country and have particularly impacted states like New York, Louisiana and Michigan. Many of their representatives in Congress say they have been working the phones at all hours of the day to try and cut through the massive red tape and get their constituents help.  Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York heard of a woman who tried her unemployment insurance line 800 times. Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana heard from a mother wondering whether her daughter with respiratory issues can stay in South Korea. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, another Democrat, has heard from workers who still have to report to work and are worried their employers aren't doing enough to keep them safe.  The far-reaching $ 2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress last month in response to the pandemic provided relief for businesses and American workers impacted by the economic toll of everyday life shutting down. It set aside billions in aid to state and local governments, unemployed workers and small businesses.  But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree that more will be be needed and that implementation of various parts of the law has gotten off to a rocky start.  "It didn't go far enough," Tlaib said of the stimulus package. "This is a crisis that is expanding."  Tlaib, whose Detroit-area congressional district is one of the poorest in the nation, is worried about first responders getting the supplies and resources they need in communities where budgets were stretched thin even before the coronavirus.  "Our local firefighters, our local police, and those at the local government level have been saying, 'you can't leave us out of any relief packages,'" she said.  Peter King, a Republican who represents another Long Island district, has heard from constituents who have been stuck on hold for hours as they try to apply for unemployment compensation or small business loans. The congressman's office has been working to alert the federal and state government to the issues as residents of his district seek to access the relief.  "There are going to be start-up pains. We have to address them, we can't deny they're there," King said.  The pandemic has also hit close to home for lawmakers.  Richmond said he knows dozens of people who have tested positive and others who have died. He noted the particular pain those in New Orleans feel for not being able to hold funerals in public.  "It's how we celebrate life and the transition to the other side," Richmond said.  King's district director, Anne, recently lost her father to the virus. She couldn't visit her father when he was in the hospital and now, after his death, she can't be with family members due to social distancing.  "This is brutal. I think the most searing impact is going to be afterwards, the fact that people who lost their loved ones were unable to grieve with them," King said. "It's definitely all around us."  Everyone has an idea on what to do next.  Zeldin wants the country to plan for the next pandemic, creating an emergency domestic manufacturing plan so the US can stockpile and be self-reliant in providing protective equipment, ventilators, tests and medicine.  Richmond wants the federal government to replenish the state's coffers decimated by a plunge in tourism and the price of oil.  Tlaib wants the next legislative relief package passed by Congress to require the Federal Reserve Bank to bail out local governments to prevent them from falling into bankruptcy.  King wants the federal government to protect and shore up pension funds that have taken a hit due to economic fallout from the pandemic.  Rice wants increased antibody testing, which could provide a clearer picture of the scope of the outbreak.  In the coming days, Congress is expected to pass an extra $250 billion for a small business loan program that directs forgivable loans to businesses with fewer than 500 employees on the grounds the money is used to pay salaries, payroll expenses and other costs like mortgages, rent or utilities. Last month, Congress appropriated $349 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, but Rice said that would not be enough to deal with an "unprecedented economic crisis" even worse than the recessions after September 11, 2001, or during the 2008 financial crisis.  For now, these members are trying to deliver to their constituents through help from both the private and public sectors. Richmond, for example, is now trying to secure a donation for 100,000 test kits.  "I think every congressman has become a middleman," said Richmond, working between vendors and constituents who need protective gear, tests and "you name it -- a little bit of everything."
2020-04-09	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Thursday that there have been more than two million coronavirus tests completed in the United States but suggested that mass testing is not going to happen.  "I'm reporting today that we passed two million tests completed in the United States," Trump said during the White House coronavirus task force's news briefing, adding that the tests are "highly sophisticated and highly accurate."  The President has been celebrating the growing number of coronavirus tests conducted in the US as a victory since the US surpassed South Korea last month as the country with the highest number of tests administered. However, compared to South Korea, the US has conducted far fewer tests per capita given the US population is more than six times larger than South Korea's.  "I think the important clarification is that we should be considering the number of cases per 1 million population and considering a rate of people tested and not the absolute numbers," said Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program. "The absolute number of tests is not very meaningful."  The Trump administration has faced widespread criticism for the lack of a testing system across the country to identify coronavirus patients and track the spread of the outbreak. While testing has ramped up in recent weeks, the lack of an aggressive testing regimen early in the outbreak led to accusations that the government missed a chance to reduce the speed and scale of the pandemic in the US. The US now leads the world in the number of reported cases.  And though the number of tests administered has continued to increase, not all labs evaluating those tests have been able to keep up.  Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation's largest commercial labs, has faced a backlog of coronavirus tests which has ballooned in the last two weeks and has delayed results up to 10 days. In late March, the lab had about 160,000 coronavirus test orders waiting to be processed, amounting to about half of the 320,000 orders for tests the company had received up to that date.  As many people with symptoms consistent with coronavirus struggle to get tested -- including health care workers such as nurses -- it's still not clear how the country will emerge from its current state. Many states are operating under stay-at-home orders and the federal government is recommending strict social distancing guidelines in order to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.  During Thursday's briefing, the President was asked by CNN's Jim Acosta whether the US would return to normal without instituting an adequate testing system, potentially through nationwide testing and monitoring. Trump appeared to interpret the question as asking whether the entire American population would be tested for coronavirus.  "We want to have it and we're going to see if we have it. Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes. We're talking about 325 million people and that's not gonna happen, as you can imagine, and it would never happen with anyone else, either," the President said. "Other countries do it, but they do it in a limited form. We'll probably be the leader of the pack."  Trump also suggested there would be "massive testing" in "certain areas" of the country.  Later on in the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence would not say if there are enough coronavirus tests available right now to reopen the country.  When asked by Acosta if the US had the testing capacity to make Americans feel comfortable about returning to work, Pence largely sidestepped the question, but when pressed, the vice president said, "We are moving every day toward meeting that moment."  He went on to say that a decision on reopening the country will be made through a combination of factors.  "First would be that we are at the end of the coronavirus for most major communities," Pence said. "Another piece of that is that we have therapeutics for Americans to take medicines if they contract the disease. Another piece of that is guidance from the CDC to public institutions, to businesses large and small about how to conduct themselves in a safe and a responsible way. And testing is also a piece of that."  Pence added that testing is being scaled up across the country daily and there is work being done on surveillance testing in addition to diagnostic testing.
2020-04-09	How does he find the balance between keeping the economy shut -- to squelch the murderous pandemic -- and allowing a resumption of normal life in order to ease the deprivation now threatening many millions of Americans?  The President and officials around the country must answer if they are willing to exchange a return to the routines on which tens of millions of people depend for a likely consequent rise in the rate of infection.  The question also has an increasingly acute political dimension for Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden is now confirmed as his Democratic rival just as the President is deprived of a crucial political asset -- a roaring economic engine -- on which he banked his hopes for a second term.  Fresh evidence of economic carnage is also likely to heap new pressure on Congress as lawmakers consider a new economic stimulus package.  New Labor Department figures on Thursday showed that 6.6 million Americans made initial unemployment claims last week, bringing the three-week cumulative total to more than 14 million. The unemployment rate had been running at historic 50-year lows but when the next monthly figures are calculated, some economists warn that it could be as high as 15%.  The jobless rate peaked at 24.9% in the 1930s while unemployment hit 10% in October 2009 as a result of the Great Recession.  The latest job losses are certain to spark fresh calls for Trump to get the economy moving again to avoid permanent damage to the jobs market, especially on conservative media which has a strong influence on his thinking.  The risk is that lifting the deep freeze too early could give the virus a chance to make a comeback. Coronanvirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx made clear on Wednesday that the reason why models have been revised downward is because of the aggressive social distancing. But those models are also based on the assumption that social distancing measures remain in place for months to come.  Earlier this month, Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci used models showing between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 even with comprehensive stay-at-home efforts. In recent days, the estimate has been revised downward to 60,000. While that total represents grave human misery -- it will add fuel to those who warn the "cure is worse than the disease."  Fauci said Thursday on "CBS This Morning" that the economy could not just be switched on like a light, and that it was imperative to keep up the pressure of stay-at-home orders to suppress the virus.  "We've got to continue in many respects to redouble our efforts at the mitigation of physical separation in order to keep those numbers down," Fauci said.  America on Wednesday experienced another tragic day with more than 1,800 deaths reported from Covid-19. Despite hopes that the pandemic is reaching its apex soon in hotspots such as New York, other regions of the country are on a slower timetable as the virus spreads, complicating any decision on an economic reboot.  Trump cannot afford to get this one wrong -- for many reasons  White House incumbents who campaign for reelection with the economy in reverse almost always lose. Trump is in a unique spot. No other American president has deliberately closed down a soaring economy in an election year. It would be a bitter irony if the economy and stock market he spent three years celebrating cannot escape the mire and dooms of a political career effectively ended by his own hand.  Given the huge pressures, the President -- who just a few weeks ago predicted he could get the economy raring by Easter -- was unusually circumspect at his daily briefing on Wednesday.  "I can't tell you in terms of the date. We don't want to go down and then start going up if we aren't careful, so we have to be careful," Trump said.  The President soberly promised to take counsel from "the professionals" and "the experts" ahead of any decision to step back from social distancing and stay-at-home recommendations that are now confining more than 90% of Americans.  Trump has long predicted that the economy will go back up like a "rocket" when it emerges from its suspended state. CNN reported Wednesday that aides are preparing plans for the "big bang" opening that he wants to see.  But it is uncertain whether the President will be able to find medical justification for such a swift restart or even whether he has the power to light things back up -- given that stay-at-home orders and restaurant and shop closures are in the purview of various state governors.  "We can say we have to be on that downside of that slope," the President said Wednesday, referring to the currently rising incidence of coronavirus infections, which are now approaching half a million.  "We can do it in phases, go to some areas where -- you know, some areas are much less affected than others," he said. "But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country."  Is time running short for Fauci and Birx?  The President, influenced by dark projections of coronavirus models and the advice of top public health officials Fauci and Birx, is committed to keeping countrywide self-distancing recommendations in place until April 30.  After that, there is going to be enormous pressure on the medical advisers -- presumably from the President -- but also his economic team, to permit a rapid reopening of the economy. Trump has been putting enormous stock in the idea that after two terrible weeks, the worst of the pandemic may have been passed. His reaction could be explosive if he's told he needs to keep the nation shuttered for another month.  Trump doesn't have time to waste. It may take many months for the economy to regain anything like its normal luster. And political science suggests that voters often solidify their choices for President months before the election, so his fate could begin to be sealed either way fairly soon.  Weeks more of economic blight could harden Biden's arguments that Trump ignored the coronavirus threat and so made the subsequent economic shutdown longer and deeper than it needed to be.  And it could give fuel to Democratic charges that Trump lacks the leadership skills to get America out of the hole and should hand it over to Biden -- a man who helped author the rebound from the Great Recession by overseeing President Barack Obama's massive economic recovery law.  A new CNN/SSRS poll published on Wednesday suggests Trump's exposure on the issue. Six-in-10 Americans say the economy is in poor shape -- up 30 points since last month in the steepest worsening of public option on the economy in polling dating back to 1997.  In March, 54% said they approved of Trump's handling of the economy. Now that number is 48%. It's the first time that figure has fallen below 50% since September. Still, there is some hope for Trump, given that two-thirds of those asked believe the economy will be in good shape a year from now. The question for the President is whether the bounce-back comes soon enough.  How far and how fast?  The biggest intangible going forward is the pace of the opening.  The US still lacks sufficient testing capabilities to accurately assess how deeply the virus has penetrated outside current hotspots.  The experience of other nations also suggests the path back to full economic health could be more of a gentle ascent than the rocket launch Trump needs before November.  China -- the origin of the virus -- has started to carefully open its economy. Although manufacturing has been expanding, it is well short of where it was before the crisis. Attempts to open movie theaters in some areas have been reversed.  Singapore has introduced a new lock down, after its initial victory over the virus was undercut by a second wave of infections. Both the city state and the rising super power have seen new infections by returning travelers, suggesting that it could be months before global air travel -- which greases global commerce -- can resume.  And ultimately, the President's hopes of a roaring economic rebound might rest with the very American people who are being credited with making sacrifices to check the virus' spread.  Weeks of confinement could unleash an outburst of exuberance once freedom is restored -- that could give the President an October surprise polling bounce.  But the experience of South Korea, which did a good job of containing the virus and is starting to open its economy, suggests that people may be initially reticent to cram back into bars, restaurants and public transport. So millions of public service jobs -- not to mention the public confidence that is vital to a sense of national well-being and prosperity -- could be months from returning.  This story has been updated to reflect the more recent unemployment claims filings.
2020-04-09	CNN  Former Los Angeles Laker player and NBA Hall of Fame point guard Magic Johnson joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to talk about his experience living through two major outbreaks -- the HIV epidemic and now this pandemic.  On racial inequality during a pandemic:  "When you think about African-Americans, we deal with a lot of health issues already. And then the lack of access to health care, that's just an unbeatable combination, and so we must get better," he said.  Change must begin at a local level, then at a state level, then at the federal level, he said.  "Until someone says, hey, we're going to make sure that African-Americans and Latinos and others have a level playing field, that the same opportunities that others have ... Until those things change, (minorities) are still going to have a lack of health care."  On the parallels between this pandemic and the HIV/AIDS epidemic:  Johnson announced in 1991 both his retirement from the NBA -- and his HIV-positive status. "I think right now is similar to what happened with HIV and AIDS," he said.  Some of those parallels include a lack of testing in black and minority communities, and a lack of accurate information within underprivileged areas, he said.  Watch:
2020-04-10	(CNN) President Donald Trump says America does not need and will never have mass coronavirus testing , despite warnings by experts that a comprehensive program is vital to getting life back to normal.  The inadequacy of testing for the virus has been a constant deficiency of the government's handling of the pandemic from the start. Fixing this deficiency, as well as creating antibody testing that can identify if someone has already had the disease and may be less apt to get it again, may be the key to effectively reopening the economy while preventing a second wave of infections. It could also help identify which workers can return to work, and those who still present a risk of infection.  Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Friday that those antibody tests are coming "within a period of a week or so" and would be especially important "for health care workers, for first-line fighters."  But the continued lack of a robust testing program, despite weeks of claims by Trump that the problem is fixed, is raising stark new questions about the White House's management of the situation. After being slow to recognize the extent of the pandemic, the testing shortfall means the administration is yet to prove it is capable of charting an effective path out of the crisis.  The new testing controversy came at the end of a grim week in which thousands of Americans have died from coronavirus. More than 462,000 Americans have now been infected and more than 16,000 have died. The human tragedy inherent in such figures is taking the edge of optimistic talk in the administration that the virus may have peaked in some US hotspots. A model often cited by the White House also this week reduced the total of Americans it believes could die from the disease to 60,000.  Medical professionals and state and local leaders still say testing is not sufficiently widespread nor fast to trace the full penetration of the novel coronavirus in the community.  Fauci said Friday that while the novel coronavirus antibody tests being developed and validated could be available "within a period of a week or so," to work to identify someone who had the virus recently, the current test used to diagnose coronavirus cases still would be needed to identify current coronavirus infection.  Many people who get sick aren't tested unless they go to hospitals. Some Americans have died before it is even confirmed that they had the disease. Other countries -- such as South Korea and Germany that have succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus -- have conducted heavy testing. The President, whose leadership during these somber days is crucial to his reelection hopes , habitually shrugs off such questions.  On Thursday, he celebrated the two-millionth coronavirus test on US soil, after White House officials administered coronavirus tests to reporters who attended his briefing.  Asked by CNN's Jim Acosta how the administration could contemplate reopening the economy without sufficient testing in place, Trump insisted the US system was "the best in the world."  "There are certain sections in the country that are in phenomenal shape already, other sections are coming online, other sections are going down, and we, in addition to that, are giving out millions of tests every day," the President said.  "We're doing it exponentially, we're picking up, and what we'll be doing in the very near future is going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing. It's not necessary but it would be a good thing to have," he said.  But seconds later, the President however appeared to contradict his own comment that the administration would put in place "massive testing" in some areas of the country.  "We want to have it and we're going to see if we have it. Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes," Trump said. "We're talking about 325 million people and that's not going to happen, as you can imagine, and it would never happen with anyone else, either. Other countries do it but they do it in a limited form. We'll probably be the leader of the pack."  The comment was typical of the imprecision with which Trump, who takes the lead in daily coronavirus briefings, has handled complex medical questions and created mixed messages that sow confusion about the true state of the coronavirus mitigation effort.  Still behind on testing  While the United States has conducted more tests than any other country after a slow start, it still lags well behind several global counterparts in terms of per capita tests. And Trump's daily boasts about the gross volume of testing have long conflicted with the apparent reality in front line health care.  Fauci , the top US infectious disease specialist who serves on Trump's coronavirus task force, said on Wednesday that the US must ensure that it is not caught napping again on testing when the economy eventually opens up.  "The keys are to make sure that we have in place the things that were not in place in January," Fauci said on an American Medical Association webcast. He said the government would need the capacity to use robust testing for "identification, isolation, contact tracing."  "There will be cases, we've got to be able to act on them in a very deliberate way that doesn't allow us to get into the situation we find ourselves right now," he added.  New CNN reporting on Thursday found multiple errors in the government testing system that squandered a critical month during which aggressive testing may have reduced the speed and scale of the pandemic as it took root on US soil. The administration failed to make early use of private labs, released a flawed test it took weeks to correct, and barred private labs from making their own tests.  Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, told CNN that the disease was not first identified when it arrived in the country from Europe.  "It has been sitting under our nose undetected because we have no ability to sniff it out with no testing," he said.  A month ago, the President said that "anyone who wants a test can get a test." But that pledge is still nowhere near being fulfilled.  And despite Trump's boasts of the world's best testing system, there remain serious problems in getting sufficient people tested for coronavirus, even those who have symptoms.  Testing a 'huge problem'  Philadelphia Public Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said Thursday that a lack of testing kits meant the disease was still advancing unseen through US communities.  "Testing has been a huge problem with us from the beginning, it's still a problem for us," Farley said. "It's a problem for us to have the data to know where this virus is moving. If we had more testing earlier on, we could have had an earlier warning sign and perhaps put in place smarter social distancing."  Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency physician in New York who has recovered from Covid-19, said she couldn't get a test to confirm that she is no longer infectious.  "The lack of widespread testing is probably the single biggest issue regarding us getting back to any sort of normalcy," Kass told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "We don't actually know who is infected. We don't know anything about our asymptotic carriers. And we don't know who is not infections anymore."  "We were told we would have unlimited capacity to test in America, but we don't," Kass said.  Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the coronavirus task force, declined to say in Thursday's briefing whether there are current sufficient tests available to begin opening the country.  The issue is becoming increasingly crucial given disastrous unemployment numbers on Thursday that show that more than 16 million people have been laid off in the economic shutdown imposed in a bid to check the spread of the virus.  "We are moving every day toward meeting that moment," Pence said.  The vice president also appeared to force a more comprehensive testing program eventually than suggested in the President's comments.  He said that the administration was aiming to put in place not just diagnostic testing, but surveillance testing "so we can identify people that may have had it and may be immune versus people that we just need to know whether or not they were ever exposed or were not exposed."  This story has been updated to include Dr. Anthony Fauci's comments on Friday.

Pritzker did not show that a mass release was the only reasonable response.  “Plaintiffs are correct in asserting that the issue of inmate health and safety is deserving of the highest degree of attention,” Dow wrote. “And the record here shows that the authorities in this state are doing just that.”  The 10 inmates named in the lawsuit – convicted on a range of felonies including murder – argued that keeping them incarcerated in the face of a pandemic amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.  Although Dow is keeping the case open – and encouraged state officials to work their hardest to preserve the health of prisoners – he refused to order the state to release, by his estimate, “at least 12,000 inmates, almost one-third of the prison population in Illinois.”
2020-04-11	A version of this story appeared in the April 11 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) Half a million Americans have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. The grim statistic means that almost one in three cases worldwide is found in the United States. New York state alone has more cases than any other country except the US.  As the country recorded the biggest single-day jump in Covid-19 deaths, President Donald Trump announced he will create an "opening our country" taskforce . But as health experts study China and other countries that are starting to lift some of the harshest restrictions, they warn that "opening" the US should not be rushed.  Earlier this week, China started allowing healthy people to leave Wuhan, where the outbreak emerged in December. In Europe, several countries are now cautiously following in China's footsteps, Laura Smith-Spark writes  Though mass gatherings and international travel remain largely off limits, some shops, outdoor exercise centers and schools are beginning to reopen in some countries including the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark and Norway.  Experts say the countries preparing to ease restrictions have something in common: They were among the first in Europe to implement harsh restrictions and quickly ramp up coronavirus testing.
2020-04-11	Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) New York state reached a tragic milestone this week: It now has more Covid-19 patients than any country in the world, aside from the United States.  The state's total of 181,026 cases, as of April 11, is higher than Spain's (161,852 cases) and Italy's (152,271), countries with populations many times larger than New York.  The disease is killing New Yorkers disproportionately. Of the 20,389 deaths in the United States, 8,627, or 42%, have occurred in New York. Its mortality rate is 4.7%, compared with 3.4% in the rest of the country, according to CNN's figures based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering  New York City and its suburban counties — Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland — are responsible for 93% of the statewide case count. Furthermore, in New York City, the Covid-19 death rate is about 6% higher than most countries.  Why does New York seem to be having a different epidemic from most other parts of the country?  Is the reason simply population size and density? New York is by far the nation's most populous city, with more than 8 million people, twice as many as Los Angeles. But New York also has eight or nine times more cases than any other city — so what gives? No other city or county has a fraction of the cases of New York City.  A caution on numbers: Counting cases and mortality rates is difficult because most counting is done by county or borough or parish rather than city, and city of residence may differ from city of diagnosis or death. Even so, New York City is off the charts.  How about population density? Covid-19 spreads most easily when people are packed together — in churches or cruise ships, in outdoor events like concerts or Mardi Gras, or perhaps in small apartments with multiple roommates or large families. New York's population density , about 27,000 people per square mile, is easily the highest in the country, though it's nowhere near the top for cities across the globe. Many cities — in Asia, for example — have a density of nearly 40,000 people per square mile.  The density explanation may explain some of the difference, but not all of it. New York's densest borough is Manhattan, while relatively sprawling Queens sits at fourth out of five. But Queens has more than twice the cases and twice the rate of cases as Manhattan.  Maybe it's because so much testing is being done in New York. If you test more, you find more, and if you find more, you test even more. It is likely that more tests, and more tests per population, are performed in New York than elsewhere in the United States, and that the New York rate stacks up favorably to countries with aggressive testing programs, such as Iceland and South Korea and Germany, but comparative information is sketchy. The split between tests performed by public versus private labs has made accurate tracking just about impossible, despite the heroic efforts of such groups as Covidtracking.com Worldometers , and Our World in Data.  Furthermore, the current advice — stay home if you are sick but stable and don't be tested — introduces additional uncertainty. This pales in comparison to the clear evidence of deaths at home likely due to Covid-19 but never diagnosed. So yes, New York City probably is testing at a brisker pace than elsewhere and yes, this may contribute to the high case numbers, but we will never have an accurate picture.  The high number of cases and rates likely do derive in some modest amount to each explanation above — plus the fact that the epidemic has been in New York City a week or two longer than many other places. A more mature epidemic is always a larger epidemic.  More concerning is the elevated mortality rate in New York City. As has been well documented, some of this is due to the tragic overwhelming of the city's hospitals. We will never know just how many people died due to the country's inept preparation for the pandemic, but the impact surely was, and still is, substantial.  Still, a mortality rate of about 6% is quite high, even though most countries, particularly in western Europe, have seen mortality rates rise as the pandemic drags on. As patients who have hung on for weeks have begun to die, and the rate of new cases has slowed, this tilts the proportion of fatal cases.  New York City also has had a very male outbreak ; substantially more men have been diagnosed, hospitalized and have died, in keeping with data seen in other countries.  Sadly, the likeliest explanation for the high death rate, though, is the chronically inadequate health care given to minorities and the poor throughout New York City, as in the rest of the country. New York City and New York state have only now released the race distribution of cases and deaths, as well as by zip code, a surrogate for poverty rates. It is clear that severe disease has not been distributed equally by race and ethnicity.  Black and Hispanic New Yorkers represent 51% of the city's population, yet account for 62% of Covid-19 deaths. They have twice the rate of death compared with whites, when adjusted for age. This likely is due to both a higher proportion of black and Hispanic New Yorkers being diagnosed with severe disease and a higher rate of death among those who are known to be infected.  This disparity likely is the result of several factors. Co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are strongly associated with death from Covid-19 and are more common in black and Hispanic communities. But what causes high rates of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes? Lack of appropriate health care. People who cannot easily find good health care for reasons of money, time, location, or trust may be more likely to stay at home undiagnosed and spread the virus — as well as experience potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The explanation is the same for New York City as for Italy, New Orleans and probably Iran: the virus exploits weaknesses in health and health care, be it advanced age or co-morbidity or access to care.  Hopefully, the Covid-19 pandemic will force us to reckon honestly with the many shortfalls that have been exposed and build a fair, forward-thinking approach that allows doctors and nurses to care for people in need. Failure to do this will only further darken the memory of those who have died and the hearts of those who remain.
2020-04-11	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks in the House of Commons in Ottawa as Parliament was recalled to consider measures related to the Covid-19 pandemic on April 11. Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP  In a rare Saturday session, Canadian lawmakers passed legislation that will subsidize up to 75% of workers’ salaries to avoid even more mass layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, now out of quarantine after his wife tested positive for the virus in March, attended the scaled-down session with a "quorum" of about 20 lawmakers.  Opposition parties joined Trudeau’s governing party to unanimously approve the wage-subsidy scheme, which will cost more than $50 billion (in US currency) and will be applied retroactively to days worked since March 15.  A majority of Canadian companies are likely to qualify for the subsidy.
2020-04-12	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during a press conference on April 6 in Istanbul, Turkey. Murat Kula/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the resignation submitted by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu after the minister came under heavy criticism for his implementation of a surprise lockdown in Turkey.  In a written statement about his resignation, Soylu said the scenes created after the lockdown announcement did not fit into the "perfectly managed process" by the government against the spread of Covid-19.  After the announcement of the curfew, people rushed out to markets to stock up on goods before the start of the lockdown leading to close contact between people.  In his statement, Soylu took near complete blame for the chaos and asked for "forgiveness from my dear nation, which I have never wanted to harm, and my president to whom I will be loyal till the end of my life."  The responsibility for the implementation of the decision for the weekend belongs to me in all aspects," he said in the written statement.  The offer of resignation was submitted to the president and was rejected, according to a written statement by the Turkish presidency.  "The decision to offer a resignation rests with the office holder but to accept it is the decision of the President. The resignation has not been accepted and the minister will continue his post," the statement said.  The statement praised Soylu's past performance across a wide range of policy issues as well as more recently on the Covid-19 measures.  Soylu has been a pivotal figure in Turkey’s fight against terrorism and is known as a nationalist hardliner.
2020-04-12	Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) The US now has the world's highest number of deaths from Covid-19 , with at least 21,692 losing their lives to the virus as of Sunday afternoon. Americans will continue to die in large numbers until our country mounts a coherent response to the epidemic. President Donald Trump has failed. The US still lacks even a basic plan for controlling the epidemic and restarting the economy.  It only takes a straightforward comparison of the US' death toll with that of Asian countries to understand the scale of the Trump administration's failure. The US now has about 62 deaths per million people. Meanwhile, according to Johns Hopkins University data , Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan all have less than 1 death per million; and China, South Korea and Singapore have each under 5 deaths per million. India, too, took decisive actions, with a complete national lockdown beginning on March 24, when there still had been only 10 deaths in a country of 1.3 billion people. As of today, India has only 289 reported deaths, or 0.2 cases per million, and the hospitals are not jammed with patients as in the US.  Unlike these Asian countries, Trump failed to prepare for the pandemic even after the alarm bells went off. He ignored urgent warning signs. He continued to make light of the high risks, saying repeatedly that everything was under control.  Trump was certainly not alone. Many European countries also failed to act in a timely way and some have death rates per million that are even higher than in the US. The United Kingdom, under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, dithered instead of acted -- and now has one of Europe's worst trajectories, while the Prime Minister himself landed in the ICU (he left the hospital on Sunday ). In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has been in denial as the epidemic grows.  Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly fails to put public health experts truly in the lead. He ignores the rudiments of basic public health and seems to view the epidemic in political and electoral rather than public health terms. As usual, he blames others for his own disastrous failings.  Trump's latest target of attack is the World Health Organization (WHO), which plays a key role in helping governments around the world to fight this disease. Here is what Trump tweeted on February 24: "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart." Yet now, with Trump's approach a tragic and obvious failure ( except to his ardent followers) he turns on the WHO because, he says, they "called it wrong."  His hyper-partisan and irresponsible allies in Congress follow his lead, calling for the US to cut off funds to WHO in the midst of the pandemic. It's hard to think of a more shameful policy that would put an end to any semblance of US global responsibility. These Congressmen have a responsibility to their suffering constituents, not to a reckless president. They should be focusing on the unfolding tragedy at home, rather than being agents of Trump's propaganda.  The attacks on the WHO are nonsensical. All countries had access to the same information at the same time. Why did the Asian countries succeed while the US and many in Europe failed so badly? The answer is national leadership and public health readiness, not the WHO, which was reporting to all countries at the same time and in the same way. An obvious truth is that WHO is just one source of information for the US and other countries. The US has its own experts, legions of them. It has its own intelligence agencies. It has its own network of epidemiological surveillance. It could directly observe China's growing alarm and dramatic actions, including China's lockdown of Wuhan beginning on January 23.  What part of this was so hard for Trump to understand?  Here's the simple truth. The alarm bells were ringing from late December onward. Taiwan, for example, began taking urgent precautions as early as December 31, 2019. The US intelligence agencies were writing to Trump in alarm in early January. The director of the China Center for Disease Control personally called the director of the US Centers for Disease Control on January 3. Trump's White House Adviser Peter Navarro wrote an urgent memo on January 28 warning of the virus' potential toll.  Trump said that he never saw these reports and memos. I believe Trump on this. He is an absentee president, other than for his rallies, reality TV "briefings," and golf games. He is propped up by a cabal of elites on the theory that not much can go wrong if the stock market is rising and taxes are low.  Trump will continue to fulminate against WHO and China and any other targets to distract attention. Yet the record is clear: China got the epidemic under control while the US did not. China implemented a strict national lockdown while the US did not. China deployed its top technologists and companies to do the job. In fact, Trump repeatedly praised China during February, only turning on China when the situation got tough in the US.  Unlike China, which turned to its public health experts, Trump turned to Vice President Mike Pence and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Thousands of Americans are dying unnecessarily as a result and we are still far from any coherent national plan. It's only the governors and mayors who are scrambling and who are consulting the experts in their public health systems, universities, and other scientific institutions.  What would be in such a national plan? It's obvious and I've outlined it before.  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook  We would be contacting symptomatic individuals and quickly isolating them. We would be tracing their contacts and testing them too. We would be using phone apps and online registries to support the tracing, testing, and isolation processes. We would be screening the public for symptoms in bus and train stations, airports, and other public places. We would be wearing face masks in public, and be using hand sanitizers relentlessly. Our goal would be to identify and isolate potential Covid-19 cases as early and quickly as possible through standard public health measures that should have been used from the start but were not. We would be doing, in short, what the Asian countries have been doing to control the epidemic.  America's failure is plain for all to see, even if Trump loyalists are blind to it. We are at the end of the "Wizard of Oz" tale. The curtain has been pushed aside to reveal the con man behind the curtain. Our choice is like Dorothy's: to go home to the country of competence we once knew, or to remain in the deadly dream kingdom of Trump.
2020-04-13	(CNN) An influential coronavirus model cited by the White House predicts the pandemic will "peter out" in May, but experts are wary about its assumption that there will be no resurgence of the virus in the summer months.  The model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, was created by Dr. Christopher Murray, who told CNN Monday the country can essentially stop coronavirus transmission this summer.  "The one thing we absolutely know for sure is that social distancing measures work," Murray said. "It leads to a situation where every case is infecting less than one other case, and that means if you keep the course, you'll get transmission essentially down to zero."  Murray cited Italy and China as places where this was happening.  According to Murray's model, Monday was the peak day for daily deaths in the United States. It projected about 2,150 Covid-19 deaths Monday, which are expected to decline moving forward.  New York, one of the hotspots for the virus, hit its peak number of deaths three days ago, according to the model, but hundreds of deaths are still expected daily for the coming week.  By August, the model predicts, a total of 68,841 people will have died in the United States, which is up from Friday's projection of 61,500 deaths.  The University of Washington model release coincides with the White House's desire to "reopen" the country soon now that the number of new cases has declined over two consecutive days, but experts warn that in the United States' coronavirus fight , different states will see different peaks.  States on both coasts are now banding together to fight the pandemic. On the East Coast, the Northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are coordinating to reopen the economy. Out West, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington agreed on a regional pact.  More than 23,600 people have died from Covid-19 since the virus arrived on American shores, according to Johns Hopkins University's numbers , but the daily tally of deaths dropped Saturday and Sunday, which could be a sign for optimism.  The number of infections -- which stood at more than 580,000 on Monday afternoon -- was also down Saturday and Sunday.  This comes as US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams says cases in some of the country's hotspots -- New York, New Jersey, Detroit and New Orleans -- appear to be "leveling off" or even declining. The situations in California and Washington, meanwhile, remain stable.  "In the midst of tragedy, there IS hope," Adams tweeted Monday . "Social distancing and mitigation IS working. There is a light at the end of this dark tunnel, so keep at it."  Still, many states are in the throes of an intense effort to stem the illness' spread. New York crossed the 10,000-death threshold Monday, as its cases topped 190,000, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. New Jersey and Michigan also have frightening death tolls, with more than 2,300 and 1,400 respectively.  The upside to New York's numbers is that the three-day average for hospitalization, new hospitalizations, intensive care admissions and intubations are all down, Cuomo said Monday morning.  States band together to fight Covid-19  Cuomo announced Monday the beginning of a "geographically coordinated" reopening plan in conjunction with leaders in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Each state will name health and economic officials to join the governors' chiefs of staffs to a working group, which will begin discussions Tuesday.  The group will come up with "parameters to go forward," Cuomo said, and while they may not agree on every aspect of the strategy, finding areas where they can coordinate will be important, especially given the states' close economic, health and transportation ties.  Calling the commuter thoroughfare from his state of Connecticut to New York the "Covid corridor," Gov. Ned Lamont said it was vital that "you don't pull the trigger too early," but applauded the partnership.  "The reality is this virus doesn't care about state borders, and our response shouldn't either," Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said.  "By working, sharing our information and intelligence, I think will help each of us make better decisions," Delaware Gov. John Carney added, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said, "We can do anything better when we work together in this region."  On the West Coast, California, Oregon and Washington are joining forces "on a shared approach for reopening our economies," a joint statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said.  The public health leaders in the three states will focus on four main goals, the statement read. These goals include: Protecting vulnerable populations at risk like those in nursing homes, ensuring care for those who may contract Covid-19, mitigating the non-direct health impacts of the virus on disadvantaged communities and protecting the public by ensuring the lifting of restrictions comes with adequate testing.  "The West Coast is guided by science. We issued stay at home orders early to keep the public healthy. We'll open our economies with that same guiding principle," Newsom tweeted Monday.  The West Coast is guided by science. We issued stay at home orders early to keep the public healthy. We'll open our economies with that same guiding principle.    CA, WA, and OR will work together on a shared vision focused on health--not politics. Together--we'll meet this moment. https://t.co/o1lTRudVwC — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) April 13, 2020  Inslee also tweeted that "any successful lifting of interventions must include a robust system for testing, tracking and isolating."  "The states will work together to share best practices and coordinate a framework to get it done," Inslee tweeted.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday he'd contact the governors of Michigan and Wisconsin to begin thinking regionally in terms of opening up the economies in each state.  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said that he would welcome a national approach to the timing of reopening the states.  "I do hope there is a focus on a better national uniformity about how we can combat this because we do have a lot of commerce and travel between our states just as we do within our state," Polis said during a Monday news conference. "We border different states that have different policies. We border different states that have different trajectories of the infection."  On the federal level, planning is underway for a federally supported "public health force" to carry out the state-level epidemiology "that's going to be necessary to open the country back up," a federal health official with knowledge of the planning told CNN.  The official, who is directly involved in the day-to-day national coronavirus response, told CNN the plan was part of discussions of next steps by the White House Task Force.  "Hundreds of millions of dollars are going out to the state health departments right now," the official said. "They are who are going to hire people to do this work. This is to beef up our public health infrastructure through individuals that the CDC hires and places in state health departments, as well as the state health departments themselves hiring people. This plan would really beef up capabilities for if in fact we reopen and we start to see a re-emergence of cases."  The federal health official told CNN that the "large-scale" push for epidemiology is part of the recent initiative led by eight "community protection" CDC field teams deployed in recent weeks. Those CDC teams were sent to states where transmission rates are low to assist state and local health departments with contact tracing and testing.  Neither the Task Force nor the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded to CNN's request for comment.  The United States is also expected to receive about 750,000 more coronavirus tests from South Korea, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  FEMA awarded contracts to manufacturers in South Korea last week to provide the tests, according to a FEMA spokesperson and federal records.  Over the weekend, the first shipment of 150,000 tests was delivered to the United States. The next shipment of 600,000 tests is expected to arrive April 15.  Trump is scheduled Tuesday to announce the formation of the "Opening our Country Council," which is expected to focus on ways to stimulate the economy. Another panel, the White House's coronavirus task force, has been focusing on providing advice to the states on what to do once reopening is advised.  The task force is weighing potential benchmarks that would precede reopening the states, but have yet to settle on specific targets, people familiar with the discussions said.  Governors say their states aren't ready to be reopened fully  Multiple governors across the country said Monday their states aren't ready to reopen their economies.  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said it was too early to know if his state was ready to loosen social distancing guidelines.  "As Dr. (Anthony) Fauci said last week, it's not like flipping a light switch, where you just go from being dark to light, all at one time. So this is going to be done in some sort of a transition. And we're going to be doing it that way here in Louisiana," Edwards said. "I cannot tell you exactly what that's going to look like yet, but we will be working really hard with all the experts to get that figured out."  Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Monday extended the state's stay-at-home order to April 30, which will make way for a "phased reboot" of the economy in May.  "Between now and then, we'll create industry-specific guidance so that businesses can be fully prepared to operate safely and to protect their employees and their customers," Lee said.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz extended the state's peacetime emergency until May 13, he announced Monday. Minnesota's stay-at-home order goes through May 4.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday also extended her state's stay-at-home order until April 30.  "By extending these Executive Orders, we ensure that our state continues to do all it can to suppress the spread of COVID-19 by limiting in-person interactions and services as much as possible right now, while also ensuring that vital goods and supplies get to the people who need them most as quickly and safely as possible," Whitmer said in a statement.  In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp dismissed the idea of formulating any plans to reopen the state any time soon.  "Our focus is on the hospital surge capacity, the ability to test more, because we are going to need that when we go back to work," Kemp said.  Governors in the Upper Great Plains say they believe the worst has yet to come as far as a peak in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The curve in North Dakota, said Gov. Doug Burgum, may be going up when other parts of the country are going down.  "We have said all along there are going to be different curves for different parts of the country, and so we are not there yet," Burgum said. "That is going to be confusing for people. If wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren't we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this."  Doctors in wait-and-see mode  All 50 states are under a federal disaster declaration for the first time in US history. There are more than 29,000 members of the National Guard deployed across the country to deal with the pandemic, according to the National Guard Bureau. Guardsmen have been called to serve a variety of roles, from staffing emergency operations centers to restocking grocery shelves.  Key to how optimistic Americans should be will depend on what comes next. The country's testing trajectory will be hugely important, experts say.  While President Donald Trump says he wants to reopen the country next month -- even telling state governments to "be ready" as he plans to announce a special council to reopen the country -- health officials say they're still in wait-and-see mode even if the numbers look promising.  "It's important to look at the country as many different separate situations," said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on NBC's "Today" show.  "This pandemic has affected different parts of the country differently," Redfield said. "We're looking at the data very carefully, county by county by county, and we will be assessing that."  Public health capabilities need to be improved to perform early case detection, isolation and contact tracing, he said, and officials need to "start working to rebuild confidence in the community, so the community has confidence to reopen."  Testing and social distancing  The US is "nearing the peak right now," Redfield told the morning show.  "You'll know when you're at the peak when the next day is less than the day before," he said. "We are stabilizing across the country in terms of the state of this outbreak."  Detroit and Los Angeles reported lower rates of cases Monday.  As for getting the country back to normal, Redfield said it has to be done correctly and "it's going to be a step-by-step, gradual process."  The call for caution is being echoed on the world stage as World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked people to remember the virus accelerates faster than it decelerates, so "control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place."  JUST WATCHED On GPS: What's the US plan for Covid testing? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On GPS: What's the US plan for Covid testing? 08:20  Redfield concurred with Adams that social distancing is working -- and said the potential death toll "while sadly too high, was far less than we anticipated" -- but said relaxing those guidelines would need to be done carefully.  Testing is still not widely available, and many states have still tested only small percentages of their populations.  The White House has worked to develop a more robust testing strategy, including shipping new rapid tests developed to states, and has worked to scale up serology testing, used to detect antibodies that would identify people who are likely immune to coronavirus and who could return to work or other aspects of normal life.  Antibody tests, which reveal past coronavirus infection -- an especially important test for health care workers -- will "give us a good idea from a surveillance point of view of how significant the outbreak was."  Weather adds to social distancing stress  As millions of Americans worried about stay-at-home orders and social distancing Sunday, about 95 million people in nearly 20 states experienced severe weather and tens of millions more will see storms Monday.  A majority of the storms were across the South and East Coast, according to the National Weather Service, with at least 34 tornadoes reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia as of early Monday. At least 18 people died.  JUST WATCHED Deadly storms that hit the South move east Monday Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Deadly storms that hit the South move east Monday 02:06  Emergency officials said Sunday people sheltering from tornadoes and protecting themselves from severe weather take priority over the social distancing guidelines Americans are adhering to during the coronavirus pandemic.  Forecast models show the worst of the weather sweeping up the eastern portions of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, but even as far north as New York, officials were urging caution.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told residents the best protection from the weather is to continue to practice social distancing.
2020-04-13	(CNN) Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.  Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.  Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.  1. Shortness of breath  Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.  "If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.  "If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added.  The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen.  Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.  2. Fever  Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.  "I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.  Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).  "There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.  "We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."  Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.  "Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained.  "One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever."  3. Dry Cough  Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.  "It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained.  The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.  "It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added.  report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.  4. Chills and body aches  "The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.  'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.  "I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said.  Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.  One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.  5. Sudden confusion  Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.  6. Digestive issues  At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.  "In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.  Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.  The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.  7. Pink eye  Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.  Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.  But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.  Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.  8. Loss of smell and taste  In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.  "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.  "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones."  "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.  A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.  Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.  9. Fatigue  For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.  Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.  "I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360 . "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours."  Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.  10. Headache, sore throat, congestion  The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.  Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.  Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.  So what should you do?  "At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.

That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.  It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.  In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.  "Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises.  To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.  "People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said.  A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.  How to be evaluated  If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.  "We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue," Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. "However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated."  If you do have those three signs, where should you go?  "If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients," Harris said.  "If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers," Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.  "If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly," Schaffer said. "It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do."
2020-04-13	Washington (CNN) The United States is turning to South Korea -- a country with an aggressive testing regime that President Donald Trump previously downplayed -- to bring approximately 750,000 more coronavirus tests to the US, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  FEMA, an agency within the US Department of Homeland Security, awarded contracts to manufacturers in South Korea last week to provide approximately 750,000 tests, according to a FEMA spokesperson and federal records.  Over the weekend, the first shipment of 150,000 tests were delivered to the US by SolGent. The next shipment of 600,000 tests will arrive by April 15. They are being provided by two South Korea-based companies, SD Biosensor and Osang Healthcare.  The intent, the FEMA spokesperson said, is to move the tests to a cold storage facility in Louisville, Kentucky, for distribution. Urgent needs will be given priority, according to a FEMA advisory obtained by CNN.  The Trump administration has waffled on its praise of South Korea's testing capabilities.  Read More
2020-04-13	Seoul (CNN) It's just after lunchtime at a central Seoul market and a crowd in hot pink jackets is gathering.  Pink is the color of the country's main opposition party, the conservative United Future Party, and this crowd of supporters is staging a legal campaign rally ahead of Wednesday's election of 300 members of the National Assembly.  Large public gatherings are a jarring sight during a pandemic.  But South Korea has never postponed an election before -- and the coronavirus is not stopping this one.  Like many democracies around the world, South Korea has been faced with a predicament: how to hold an election during a pandemic without spreading the virus.  Campaign workers for the conservative United Future Party hold posters at a market in Dongdaemun in Seoul, South Korea, on April 7.  outbreak, including Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, France and Ethiopia. Others, like the United States and New Zealand, are still deciding whether to proceed with their scheduled votes. At least 47 countries have postponed elections due to the coronavirusoutbreak, including Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, France and Ethiopia. Others, like the United States and New Zealand, are still deciding whether to proceed with their scheduled votes.  Many of those countries are at different points in the virus outbreak. South Korea peaked early, prompting praise for the government's handling of the pandemic. The country isn't in lockdown, and of the more than 10,500 confirmed cases, more than 7,400 have recovered.  Nevertheless, South Korea has made a number of election concessions for the virus.  Polling booths will be regularly disinfected and anyone with a temperature of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Farenheit) will have to vote in a special booth. About 20,000 additional workers will be dispatched to put in place the extra measures. More than 11 million people -- or 26.7% of registered voters -- cast their vote in advance to avoid crowds, according to the National Election Commission. Early voters, and those casting their vote on Wednesday, will have their temperature checked at the door.Polling booths will be regularly disinfected andanyone with a temperature of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Farenheit) will have to vote in a special booth. About 20,000 additional workers will be dispatched to put in place the extra measures.  Special voting booths have been set up at government-run isolation centers, and those under self-quarantine will be allowed to leave their house to vote after polling booths close to the public at 6 p.m.  A South Korean woman casts a ballot during early voting at a polling station in Seoul on April 10.  Voters CNN talked to were supportive of the decision to go ahead. Some said the pandemic made voting even more important.  "I'm not too worried about catching the virus at the polling station as we'll keep social distancing in mind," said 53-year-old Lee Chang-Hoe, who runs a fish tempura shop at the market in Dongdaemun where the UFP rally took place. "Just like a frozen river in winter, even though there is thick layer of ice on the surface, water must flow underneath -- I think it's the same for the election, even during this coronavirus outbreak, elections must go on."  But experts warn that going ahead with an election and delaying an election both come with risks -- not just to public health, but to democracy.  "Intuitively, we think postponing an election sounds anti-democratic," said Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia. "But actually democracy in some ways could be undermined by holding an election in these times."  Going ahead with an election  There's historical precedent for going ahead with elections in a time of crisis.  In 1864, the US held a presidential election despite the country being in the midst of a civil war . During the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak that killed about 675,000 people in the US alone, the country went ahead with its mid-term vote, although the turnout was very low, according to the New York Times  As James points out, postponing an election is not something democracies like to do, both for the health of the democracy and for practical reasons. "Elections are a huge logistical task. They take years of planning, it's very difficult to unpick from those arrangements," he said.  turn out. The Australian state of Queensland went ahead with its local body elections on March 28, with the state's electoral commission calling elections " an essential service ." But there was a backlash -- medical experts warned that holding an election posed a " lethal risk ," and political experts warned there could be a lowerturn out.  Voters keep a distance in Brisbane, Australia, on March 28.  Like South Korea, the state took precautions. Voters were asked to bring their own pencils and hand sanitizer was supplied at polling booths. Those in isolation due to Covid-19 were allowed to vote by telephone , and around a third of voters cast their ballot during the early voting period, reducing the numbers of voters on election day.  at around In Australia, voting is compulsory -- and anyone who didn't vote in Queensland faces a possible $133.45 (about $86) fine. Nevertheless, early figures put the turnoutat around 75% , down from around 83% during the last election.  "You don't know how many people would have liked to have voted, but felt too concerned," said University of Queensland electoral law expert Graeme Orr.  long-awaited parliamentary election held two weeks later. Low turnout is one of the risks of holding an election during a pandemic. James noted that turnout also dropped in France 's mayoral election in mid-March and Mali 'slong-awaited parliamentary electionheld two weeks later.  A voter casts their ballot in front of an official wearing plastic gloves in a polling station in Lyon on March 15.  Detailed information on voter demographics hasn't been released, but James noted that some at-risk groups may have chosen not to vote, which could affect the final count.  Orr said Queensland should have suspended in-person voting, and instead held an all postal ballot.  Although US President Donald Trump claimed that voting-by-mail is "corrupt" and "dangerous," due to the risks of voter fraud, experts believe that postal voting will be key for any country holding an election during the pandemic.  Campaigning in a pandemic  In a healthy democracy, elections are a time to discuss a wide range of topics.  But right now, there's really only one topic dominating conversation. James points out that holding an election during a crisis means discussion is often limited to how well the government is responding to it.  "It doesn't allow a full range of issues to be discussed, and it does really undermine a sense of democracy," he said.  That was the case during the election in Queensland, where there was no space to talk about non-pandemic issues, Orr said.  Another issue is the difficulty of communicating with voters. If countries are in lockdown, rallies, door-knocking, meeting voters in shopping malls -- might not be possible.  That was something that former South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon found during this year's campaign. He said hugs and handshakes can be more impactful than words, but social distancing has ruled that out for now. "We are limited in expressing our feeling this time," he told CNN as he campaigned in the Jogno district of Seoul. Despite that, CNN spotted Lee hugging a supporter as he campaigned.  Lee Nak-yeon, a candidate of the ruling Democratic Party, wears a mask as he meets with supporters on April 10 in Seoul, South Korea.  In recent years, electioneering in many countries has increasingly moved online -- and online campaigns could become even more important during a pandemic. Those who can't access the internet are already marginalized, but they could become even more isolated without other measures to reach them.  It's even worse in countries with state-owned media. Without rallies, opposition parties have even fewer ways to get their message out.  "Incumbents always have an advantage," said Sarah Repucci, the vice president of research and analysis for democracy non-governmental organization Freedom House. "But they have a bigger advantage in an environment where it's difficult to get information out or get organized."  Postponing an election  Faced with all those issues -- and the unfolding health crisis -- some countries have opted to postpone their elections.  But this, too, comes with risks, say experts. That's because elections are necessary to keep the public's trust, and to maintain the legitimacy of lawmaking.  In Australia's New South Wales, for instance, local government elections have been delayed by one year , meaning mayors and local councilors will stay in power for 12 more months.  Sri Lanka has yet to announce a new date after calling off a parliamentary election set for April 25. The cancellation has left the island in a constitutional predicament -- parliament had already been dissolved ahead of the election date, so technically the country has no parliament.  Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has said he will pick a new date in May. Repucci said rescheduling is vital to retain public trust in the process. She said any decision to delay an election should be done with cross-party support, to avoid situations where leaders are making unilateral decisions to extend their terms.  And when countries do eventually hold their elections, they should make sure remote voting is available for everyone, but also allow some sanitary, in-person polling stations, Repucci said.  "Democracy has survived through many different kinds of environments," she said. "It's going to look different, but that doesn't mean it can't have the same fundamental components that are so important to a democracy."  A slide into authoritarianism  Elections are only one part of a functioning democracy.  In some countries, leaders have taken on extraordinary powers to allow them to restrict freedoms so they can control the deadly spread of the virus.  In New Zealand, the government has declared a state of emergency for only the second time in the country's history, giving the government sweeping powers including the authority to close roads, evacuate any premises, and exclude people from any place. But it also set up a special committee led by the leader of the main opposition party to allow them to scrutinize the government's coronavirus response in the absence of a sitting parliament.  To Repucci, this is reminiscent of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when countries around the world pushed through restrictions as part of their fight against terrorism. At the time, the rules played on people's fears -- but in many countries, the rules were never reversed.  One example of this is the Patriot Act in the US, which was brought in following 9/11 and gave the government broader surveillance powers.  "We are already seeing (leaders) using the pandemic as an excuse to consolidate their role and to put measures in place that are there indefinitely and would be very, very hard to reverse," she said.  Both Repucci and James say that the real test will be after the pandemic is over.  "Will the president return those powers back to legislatures or will they try to hang onto them?" James questioned. "It's very early to tell -- what we do know is that this will be a huge test for democracies around the world."  For South Korea, the first test is Wednesday.  election season has been more sedate. As they campaigned in Seoul, candidates wore gloves and face masks -- one even wore a face visor. While election campaigns in the country tend to be colorful affairs, featuring K-pop style dance troupes and quirky outfits, thiselection seasonhas been more sedateAs they campaigned in Seoul, candidates wore gloves and face masks -- one even wore a face visor.  But while it's a different atmosphere, constituents such as 49-year-old construction worker Cho Seung-chul have every intention of voting on Wednesday.  "Many people are concerned because of the coronavirus," he said. "I think this situation makes it more important for me to exercise my right to vote."
2020-04-13	During Monday's task force briefing, the White House presented a digital montage of TV and radio clips of President Trump’s early actions with the coronavirus. One clip featured audio from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who can be heard describing how the President was criticized for his early travel ban from China.  Facts First: The Haberman quotes are misleading as they edit out one of her key points: that the President’s travel restriction was one of the last actions he took to address the coronavirus for weeks.  Here’s the Haberman quote as it was presented by the White House video:  “As there were more cases and it was clear that it was spreading out of China �� where it originated — the President took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time. Which was he halted a number of flights from China into the U.S. The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.”  According to a transcript of The Daily podcast from March 25, here’s the end of the quote, including a key point at the end that was left out of the White House presentation:  “At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.”  According to the transcript, the Daily’s host Michael Barbaro asks a follow up question: “So the right decision in retrospect, but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission.”  Haberman responded: “That’s exactly right. In the same way that George W. Bush was criticized for his “Mission Accomplished” banner about Iraq, the president treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment. He did not do anything after that in terms of alerting the public, or telling people to be safe, or telling people to take precautions. And it basically squandered several weeks within the US.”  As Haberman pointed out on Twitter, she went on to say that the President “treated that travel limitation as a Mission Accomplished moment,” harkening back to former President George W. Bush.
2020-04-14	A version of this story appeared in the April 14 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) Incensed by criticism of his response to the pandemic and regional pacts formed by governors to reopen states on their terms, President Donald Trump lashed out yesterday at the daily White House briefing. Trump mounted a furious defense of himself, screening a misleading propaganda video, launching an attack on the media and denying claims that he'd ignored early warnings about the virus.  With 23,000 Americans now dead and millions more without a paycheck, Trump seemed intent on conveying he was in absolute control, claiming powers never envisioned by the Constitution and insisting his "authority is total" to order states and cities to reopen, Stephen Collinson writes . Legal experts, not to mention governors themselves, disagree.  "We don't have a king. We have an elected president," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN. Cuomo is one of the governors on the country's east and west coasts working together on plans to restart businesses and ease social-distancing guidelines in a way that limits new outbreaks in their regions.  As Trump attempted to paint a rosy picture of his response to the world's worst outbreak, photos emerged of bodies being stored in vacant rooms and piled into refrigerated holding units at one hospital in Detroit -- a grisly reminder that officials across the US are struggling to cope.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: What are antibody tests?  A: Antibody tests aren't meant to diagnose active coronavirus infections. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system, known as antibodies, through a blood sample. Their presence means a person was exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean that person has at least some immunity -- although experts are not sure how strong the immunity is or even how long it will last. Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, has said a large number of the tests will be available in the next week or so.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Lockdowns extended, as others lift  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ordered the country's more than 1 billion people to remain at home until May 3, but said that some states which have avoided outbreaks may be allowed to resume "important activities."  French President Emmanuel Macron last night announced plans to begin easing the country's lockdown in four weeks time, from May 11. The move comes as other European nations are taking steps to tentatively ease measures, including hard-hit Spain , where hundreds of thousands of people are now back at work.  Russia rolls out 'cyber Gulag'  Vladimir Putin says Russia has "nothing to boast about" when it comes to its handling of a worsening outbreak, and warned that the number of seriously ill patients is on the rise.  The President's comments come as Moscow rolls out digital tracking to enforce lockdown measures, Mary Ilyushina writes . The QR code system — the latest authoritarian tech to be rolled out by the Kremlin — has been dubbed a "cyber Gulag" by critics, who say it represents an unprecedented threat to privacy.  Health concerns mount over potential treatment  Chloroquine is one of the drugs Trump has touted as a potential treatment for the coronavirus despite little evidence that it works. Now a small trial in Brazil has been cut short after patients taking a higher dose developed irregular heart rates. Hospitals in Sweden have also been cautioned against using the drugs, and American cardiology groups have urged doctors to be aware of "potential serious implications" when used by people with existing cardiovascular disease.  Democracy under threat  South Korea is holding an election in spite of the ongoing crisis. At least 47 other countries have postponed theirs, while some, like the US and New Zealand, are still deciding whether to proceed with scheduled votes.

2020-04-14	The Nebraska Crossing Outlet shopping mall is seen in Gretna, Nebreska, Tuesday, April 14. Nati Harnik/AP  Nebraska Crossing Outlets says it will fully open its doors on April 24 for brick and mortar shopping.  The outlets will allow its more than 80 tenants to invite customers to shop in what it called a “soft opening.”  Nebraska Crossing Outlets, near Omaha, would become one of the first malls to fully open back up across the country.  Owner and developer Rod Yates told CNN his tenants, which include several global retail brands, asked to use his outdoor outlet as a case study to see what best practices are necessary to start opening storefronts across the country and globe.  “At some point here, we got to start thinking about how brick and mortar is going to interact with retailers and customers and so we found an opportunity here to kind of do that,” Yates said in an interview with CNN.  “We’ll experiment, we're going to walk, we're going to be very, very cautious,” he added.  The mall has largely been open for individual stores to fulfill curbside pick-up orders but haven’t let customers actually inside the stores. This soft opening would change that. The outlet mall is home to retailers like Nike, Adidas, Polo Ralph Lauren, Kate Spade among others.  Some background: Nebraska is one of seven states in the US to have no official stay-at-home order. With less than 1,000 cases statewide, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered businesses like hair salons, tattoo parlors and strip clubs to be closed until May 31 but only “urged” individuals to practice social distancing guidelines without making them mandatory.  The state’s peak is expected around May 2, eight days after the outlet mall reopens.  Yates said he’s communicated with Ricketts about the outdoor mall opening, saying the governor cautioned against creating any mass opening events — leading to the “soft opening” that will gradually transition to a full opening in May, according to a letter sent to stores.  As a precaution, Yates said the mall bought 100 of infrared forehead thermometers to give to each store, encouraging them to take the temperatures of employees and possibly even customers. But the use is not mandatory. Covid-19 can be contagious even when those infected don’t have fevers.  Yates said he will also leave crowd size regulation up to individual stores. The outdoor mall sits on more than 40 acres of land, Yates said, but shop sizes vary so creating a one-size fits all mandate for stores isn’t ideal. He does not expect all stores will participate in the opening.

Coronavirus  Experts are hopeful that the worst of the coronavirus outbreak is over in places like Germany and the US. But the long-term consequences are just beginning. France says its national economy may contract by 8% due to the pandemic. In the UK, one third of all national health staff tested were positive for Covid-19. India has extended its nationwide lockdown to May 3 to try to keep the virus from picking up speed. In the US, President Trump delivered a vitriolic briefing from the White House , lashing out at criticism of his administration's handling of the outbreak, claiming he has "total" authority over how the country recovers, and playing what some described as a propaganda video framing his response in a positive light. He also seemed at odds with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's leading immunologist , after Fauci conceded that earlier mitigation efforts could have saved more American lives.

On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington agreed on a regional pact to coordinate their economic and health care responses. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also says he will be in contact with the governors of Michigan and Wisconsin to try to work together in the upper Great Plains. Though governors and mayors have been at the forefront of efforts to quell coronavirus spread, President Trump sharply rebuked state leaders in his White House address , asserting that when it comes to making decisions on when to open up the country, his "authority is total."

Southeast storms  A 1,200-mile stretch of deadly storms battered the Southeast, leaving at least 32 people dead in six states . At least 40 tornadoes were reported from Texas to South Carolina, some covering an estimated 100 miles of ground. The havoc and heartache caused by the storms has been made even worse by the pandemic . First responders, already taxed with Covid-19 emergencies, were inundated with calls. Food banks, already depleted, had little to offer survivors. In some places, normal evacuation procedures had to be altered because the outbreak made it unsafe to open emergency shelters. However, emergency officials made it clear that staying safe from storms takes precedence over social distancing guidelines.  JUST WATCHED Deadly storms hit the South Replay More Videos ...

The country's approach to the pandemic has been met with concern by global health and human rights organizations . Schools have stayed open, social distancing rules have been absent, and social gatherings have largely gone on unabated.

2020-04-14	His utter lack of decisiveness and his misstatements in dealing with the state's ongoing fight against coronavirus has drawn him lots and lots of attention -- none of it good.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  "You know what Florida really needs right now?  "A governor.  "But in Ron DeSantis, Florida, at this most challenging time of the coronavirus, has a hesitant leader who continues to split the baby; a man who we would like to think is acting against his better judgment, perhaps, for political favor, but to the detriment of the rest of us."  Woof.  Add to that a few things that happened just yesterday :  * DeSantis declared WWE -- yes, professional wresting -- an "essential" business in the state , meaning that the organization could run live shows from its facility in Orlando. (Sidebar: I am a GIANT pro wrestling fan. But did we need a live "Monday Night Raw" on, uh, Monday night?)  * Florida's surgeon general Scott Rivkees said that social distancing and mask-wearing should continue in Florida until a vaccine for coronavirus is approved. (That is likely to be a year or so from now.) Rivkees was almost immediately then "whisked away" by the governor's spokeswoman, according to the Tampa Bay Times . DeSantis' communications director Helen Ferre disputed that Rivkees was pulled out of the conference, telling CNN in a statement that "Dr. Rivkees was not pulled out of the press conference, which ran longer than expected. He had a pre-scheduled meeting with Governor DeSantis' Deputy Chief of Staff Adrian Lukis he needed to attend. Afterwards, he went to the State Emergency Operations Center with DEM Director Jared Moskowitz."  And that error came after weeks of criticism of DeSantis for resisting the issuance of a stay-at-home order in the state -- particularly given its considerable senior population and the virus' demonstrated deadliness for those 65 years and older.  When DeSantis did finally put out a stay-at-home order, his reasoning for doing so was, uh, questionable. "When you see the President up there and his demeanor the last couple of days, that's not necessarily how he always is," DeSantis explained. So, Trump's more somber "demeanor" at one press conference was the key to DeSantis' decision? Righto!  DeSantis' defenders note that while Florida is the third most populated state in the country, it is barely in the top 10 of states with the most coronavirus cases and its numbers of deaths (499) are nothing close to New York (10,000+), New Jersey (2,400+) and Michigan (1,600+).  To that argument I would point people to a tweet on Monday night from Yahoo News' Alexander Nazaryan  "Florida now has twice as many coronavirus cases (20,601) as South Korea (10,537).  "About 30 million more people live in South Korea than in Florida."  The simple truth about DeSantis that has been exposed over the past month is this: He simply wasn't (and isn't) ready for the challenge that coronavirus poses to his state. He spent three terms representing Florida in the US House before launching what was, at the start, considered a long-shot bid for the state's open governorship in 2018 (DeSantis had served as a Judge Advocate General in the Navy.) DeSantis was plucked from obscurity by Trump, who endorsed his primary bid -- catapulting him from forgotten to frontrunner. Trump was also by DeSantis' side during the general election, campaigning for him on the day before the 2018 vote.  While DeSantis' fealty to Trump -- he ran ads during the campaign showing him chanting "build that wall" at his toddler daughter -- served him well in getting to the governor's office, it has been a less effective strategy to deal with the coronavirus pandemic in Florida.  A much less effective strategy.

Trump said the US allots $400 million to $500 million to the WHO each year, and if the organization had better investigated early outbreaks in China, the US would have been better prepared. The WHO has faced criticism for what some say was a slow response to the growing crisis in China at the beginning of the year. However, Trump is facing his own round of criticism for his response to US outbreaks, so some politicians think he's trying to deflect blame. Others, like Bill Gates, have warned that halting funding to a major international health organization during a pandemic, even if it did make mistakes, is a dangerous move.

Unfortunately, after the FDA loosened restrictions on the tests, scientists realized new tests on the market were not all reliable .

2020-04-15	Seoul (CNN) South Korea's ruling party has won by a landslide in a parliamentary election that attracted the highest voter turn out in 28 years, despite being held during the coronavirus pandemic.  According to final results from Wednesday's election, President Moon Jae-in's Democratic Party won 180 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly, boosting the party's seats by 60.  This is the biggest win by any party since the current democratic constitution was established in 1987.  "The world had marveled again at this general election," Moon said in a statement following the win. "Thank you for giving strength to our government to overcome the crisis."  The election -- which was the first nationwide vote held in a country with a significant coronavirus outbreak -- was also remarkable for its turnout.

2020-04-15	Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the United States would halt payments to the World Health Organization (WHO). He charged the organization with "severely mismanaging and covering up" the Covid-19 pandemic and claiming that "so much death has been caused by their mistakes."  Trump is desperately trying to deflect attention from his own catastrophic behavior. He has presided over one of the largest security failures in US history, with far more deaths than at Pearl Harbor or on 9/11.  While the President has called for an investigation of the WHO, it's his own administration's disastrous response to the crisis that needs scrutiny. The urgent and practical goal should be to fix the federal response before possibly hundreds of thousands of lives are lost. The Congressional Oversight Committee should immediately scrutinize the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic so that we can change course.  At this point it's clear: The Trump Administration has failed. The United States has so far incurred 26,000 deaths, 79 per million ; South Korea, in contrast, has incurred 225 deaths, just 4 per million . Taiwan's death toll stands at just 6 deaths ( 0.3 per million ) and Singapore's death toll stands at 10 ( 2 per million ).  Many other countries have a similar record of lower death rates. Canada's is less than a third of the US rate, with 24 per 1 million . Some countries in Europe have more deaths per million than the United States, but we should judge our performance against the highest-performing countries and investigate how to improve US performance rapidly before incurring a further massive loss of life.  The overwhelming evidence is that the Trump administration received repeated early warnings of a possible pandemic. Indeed, even before his inauguration , Trump received warnings of the grave danger of a global pandemic, and such a threat was rated among the highest security threats facing the United States. The threat of pandemics was well known and well studied in the intelligence, military and scientific communities.  There is no way around the reality that Trump was unable to process this information and give direction to the federal government to respond to it effectively in the manner that Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and other countries did.  Here is what we know, and what questions remain to be answered from an in-depth congressional investigation:  First, China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on December 31. According to Reuters, the National Security Council also received notice of the outbreak around the same time from a US health attaché in Beijing. The investigation should ascertain whether and when the White House received this information and when was it first part of the President's intelligence briefings.  On the basis of the reports from China, on December 31 Taiwan immediately began to screen flight arrivals from Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged, without waiting for WHO guidance or any other advice. South Korea began to screen flights from January 3  The US screening that began on January 17 was haphazard at best, nonexistent in many places at worst. Why didn't the US government follow the lead of Taiwan, South Korea and others on flight screenings?  On January 3, according to Reuters, the director of China's Center for Disease Control, Dr. Gao Fu, called the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, to discuss the outbreak. What did they discuss? When were the details of the call conveyed to Trump and the National Security Council?  According to The Washington Post, the US intelligence agencies issued classified briefs in January and February on the dire urgency of the epidemic. What were the warnings, and were there specific recommendations made by the intelligence agencies?  Trump now seems to think the United States was misled by the WHO. In what ways did the United States rely on WHO statements and warnings for its policies, given that many other countries were proceeding on the basis of a high emergency situation?  On January 23, the WHO Emergency Committee declined to declare Covid-19 a global health emergency, an action that it took a week later , on January 30. The US CDC has a senior official on the WHO committee. What was the advice of the US committee member at the January 23 meeting? Did the US representative call for declaring Covid-19 a global emergency? Was the CDC position discussed with Trump?  The Centers for Disease Control sent out faulty test kits around the United States in early February. Red tape prevented the issue from being resolved as quickly as possible. Other nations developed test kits and went into large-scale testing weeks before the United States. What accounts for this basic failure of the CDC?  Early on in the outbreak, Trump repeatedly asserted that the pandemic was not a great threat in the United States. He told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland , on January 22, "We have it totally under control," thereby misleading or deceiving not only Americans but the entire world.  In February, he asserted that with the warm weather of April, the virus "miraculously goes away," once again contrary to scientific evidence . There are countless other such misguided statements.  The federal government and many states have been in a nonstop battle over scarce and urgently needed supplies including personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, test kits and other medical basics. What information was used to decide how to assist each state in acquiring these medical essentials? Trump long delayed invoking the authority of the Defense Production Act, causing governors and mayors to scramble desperately until now for these missing supplies. Why did Trump refuse to utilize the Defense Production Act for many critical weeks?  As of now, there is no agreed national strategy for how to reopen the economy. On the contrary, Trump and many governors are in open conflict about the best plan of action. What federal management systems and agencies are being used to obtain the best information and evidence for how to proceed and to coordinate the actions of the federal and state governments?  Answers to these questions are urgently needed. The United States failed to act early, to heed the dire alarms heard clearly by many other nations to mobilize supplies of vital commodities and to coordinate between national, state and local levels.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Addressing these urgent questions is the responsibility of the House Oversight Committee, which is the House of Representatives' main investigative committee. Its legislative jurisdiction includes the "overall economy, efficiency, and management of government operations and activities, including federal procurement," the "relationship of the federal government to the states and municipalities," and "reorganizations in the executive branch of government."
2020-04-15	(CNN) Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.  Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.  Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.  1. Shortness of breath  Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.  "If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.  "If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added.  The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen.  Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.  2. Fever  Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.  "I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.  Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).  "There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.  "We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."  Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.  "Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained.  "One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever."  3. Dry Cough  Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.  "It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained.  The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.  "It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added.  report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.  4. Chills and body aches  "The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.  'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.  "I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said.  Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.  One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.  5. Sudden confusion  Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.  6. Digestive issues  At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.  "In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.  Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.  The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.  7. Pink eye  Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.  Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.  But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.  Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.  8. Loss of smell and taste  In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.  "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.  "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones."  "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.  A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.  Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.  9. Fatigue  For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.  Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.  "I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360 . "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours."  Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.  10. Headache, sore throat, congestion  The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.  Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.  Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.  So what should you do?  "At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.

That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.  It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.  In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.  "Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises.  To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.  "People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said.  A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.  How to be evaluated  If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.  "We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue," Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. "However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated."  If you do have those three signs, where should you go?  "If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients," Harris said.  "If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers," Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.  "If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly," Schaffer said. "It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do."
2020-04-15	US President Donald Trump speaks at the daily briefing of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in the Rose Garden at the White House on Wednesday, April 15 in Washington. Alex Wong/Getty Images  Days after declaring that his authority over the states is total, President Trump threatened Wednesday to apply a never used provision of the US Constitution to allow him to adjourn the US Congress and push through many of his nominees who typically require Senate confirmation.  “As the entire US government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed, and we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress,” Trump said. “They’re just not giving it to us. We have many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get approval.”  Trump said there were 129 nominees “stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.”  Trump’s argument seemed to be that many of these vacancies needed to be filled to assist with the coronavirus response, including the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department and an Undersecretary of Agriculture.  The President argued that since the Senate has left until May 4, “the Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances. The recess appointment, it’s called. The Senate’s practice of gaveling into so-called pro-forma sessions where no one is even there has prevented me from using the Constitutional authority we’re given,” Trump said, calling on the Senate to formally adjourn.  The decision to stay away from Washington until May 4 was made, and announced, by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and close Trump ally.  A McConnell spokesman said Trump and McConnell spoke about the issue today. “The Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the Covid-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from Leader Schumer."  That last point is an important one. McConnell, who is careful with his words, appears to be saying any solution to the confirmation issue will require Democratic consent.  The Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval. But lawmakers in both parties have sought to thwart certain appointments over the last decade by never technically shutting down the Senate.  When then-President Barack Obama attempted to make recess appointments during pro-forma sessions in 2014, the US Supreme Court ruled "that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue." Justice Stephen Breyer said, "We hold that the Senate is in session, and not in recess, when the Senate says that it is in session.  However, tonight Trump said he may use powers granted to the executive branch in order to get Congress to return to Washington to fill vacancies and vote on relief aid.  “I have a very strong power. I’d rather not use that power but we have way over a 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago," he said.  The Constitution says the President "may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper." The Court did not rule on that clause, as it was never invoked by the Obama administration or any prior administration.  Given the authority has never been invoked before, it’s murky as to what would define “disagreement” in this case. Both chambers would technically need to adjourn to clear the way for recess appointments, and the Democratic-led House is exceedingly unlikely to hold a vote to adjourn.  That means McConnell would likely have to bring senators back to Washington to vote to adjourn in order to create the “disagreement” cited in the Constitution that would provide the grounds for Trump to act. The Senate has been out of Washington out of concern over the safety of senators due to the pandemic.  Trump, as he sought to explain his consideration of the action, took special note of Michael Pack, the President’s choice to lead the Broadcasting Board of Governors, whose organization doesn’t hold a clear role in the federal government’s coronavirus health or economic response.  Trump specifically cited his nomination to head the board of Voice of America as a particular grievance in not getting appointed, and continued to attack the news organization.  “He’s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America, very important. And if you’ve heard what’s coming out of the Voice of America, it’s disgusting. The things they say are disgusting toward our country,” Trump said of Pack.  Trump did not explain how the nominee to be CEO of the US Agency for Global Media would enhance federal efforts to counter the pandemic.  But he reiterated his threat to adjourn both chambers of Congress several times.  “If they don’t approve it, we’re gonna go this route,” Trump said. “We are going to do something that will be something I prefer not doing.”
2020-04-16	(CNN) Patience is in ever-shorter supply. No one is happy with the current situation. But some Americans see the yoke of oppression in public health efforts to keep people home , and they're growing louder.  Underneath the general frustration and dazed acceptance of so much of the world changing its lifestyle for the time being lurks a growing defiance of the science that tells us how to deal with Covid-19 and the government that is telling everyone (to varying degrees) to stay indoors  That President Donald Trump , normally an expert stoker of conspiracy theories, is leading the government may have initially muted the Covid-19 deniers. No more. A few instances of Twitter protest -- including from Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who bragged over the weekend about going to the beach -- have flowered into full-scale public demonstrations in Michigan.  Success creates second-guessing. Trump's anxious efforts to get the economy opened even before the curve of Covid-19 cases is flattened, and his chronic spreading of fake promises about treatments, will only feed that growing angst.  The more successful the federal and state governments are at flattening the coronavirus infection curve, the more people will question whether halting the nation's economy was necessary in the first place.  Despite the deniers, even Trump is not rushing to open things up. Read more about his announcement Thursday of new guidelines on reopening the country.  The guidance is not unlike what California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced recently as his own criteria. Read it here.  The bottom line: Trump and Newsom appear to agree that the worst of this must pass, different parts of the country will open earlier than others, and testing and tracing of cases must improve.  We're all going to be paying for this for a very long time.  Protesting public health -- CNN's Jeff Zeleny writes -- CNN's Jeff Zeleny writes a must-read profile of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has been on the job for only a few months but is already turning into a key national figure.  Drivers jammed into Michigan's capital and surrounded the state Capitol in a protest against her stay-at-home order that featured neither face masks nor social distancing, but rather the honking of horns that could be heard inside.  Zeleny: "The collision between a public health battle and a political one, which played out for more than five hours here on Wednesday, underscores the boiling tensions of a restless nation struggling with the wisdom of reopening the economy before the deadly pandemic subsides, even as President Donald Trump moves closer to easing national guidelines for social distancing.  "Whitmer could hardly ignore the scene, considering the honking horns, raucous jeers and blaring music became background noise for her video conference call with health care workers."  Regional authorities -- Whitmer is among the bipartisan group of -- Whitmer is among the bipartisan group of seven Midwestern governors who have said they will coordinate their efforts to slowly reopen society.  It mirrors a similar announcement by governors on the East and West costs, completing the emergence of ad hoc regional pacts in place of national guidance from a skeptical President.  Fox News turns again. In February and much of March the conservative outlet . In February and much of March the conservative outlet fed the coronavirus deniers , then took things seriously when New York became ground zero for the pandemic in the US, but it has turned again.  Now conservatives are fomenting rebellion against public health guidelines.  In their warped telling, people who venture out in public aren't vectors for infection but rather freedom fighters standing up to oppression.  As CNN's Brian Stelter writes, "Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday tweeted approvingly of people in Michigan demonstrating against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's order. " Time to get your freedom back," Ingraham declared.  "Soon Marylanders, Virginians, etc will stand for their right to work, travel, assemble, socialize and worship? Massive long lasting damage is piling up day after day as many 'experts' continue to get the virus analysis wrong," Ingraham wrote in another tweet.  Those perceptions could change. See the recent reports about a rise of coronavirus in rural America.  About those protests  CNN's Jeff Zeleny is the rare person who has traveled lately. Here's what he had to say about the protest:  What set this rally apart  ZW: First and most important, the thing that struck me most in your story was this apparent backlash to social distance in the form of a protest that could literally be heard from the governor's office. Did that feel different to you than a normal partisan disagreement? Was it more grassroots or groundswell?  JZ: The protest was large, but the thing that struck me the most is that it went on and on, with honking horns, blaring music and raucous jeers for more than five hours. It was protest-by-parade — definitely not organic, considering it was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, but the anger was absolutely real. It had the feel of a Trump rally from 2016 and a Tea Party rally from 2010 — back at a time when rallies were the norm.  What was striking was dozens upon dozens of people who stood on steps of the Capitol and the surrounding sidewalk, defying not only the strict stay-at-home orders, but also blatantly ignoring basic medical common sense.  There's no question the economic pain is real in Michigan, with about one-quarter of the state's eligible workforce seeking some type of unemployment help. But the Village People's "YMCA," which blasted from a Trump trailer that's often seen at the President's campaign rallies, seemed oddly discordant on a day that the state's death toll hovered around 2,000 people.  Traveling during Covid-19  ZW: Second, you're the first person I've talked to recently that has been away from their house. What was it like in an airport? In a hotel? Or did you avoid both?  JZ: I flew from Reagan National in Washington to the Detroit Metro Airport, both of which were virtually empty. The biggest inconvenience: No coffee for my 6 a.m. flight on Wednesday, since all restaurants were closed. And only bottled water, with a side of Biscotti and Purell wipes served in a plastic bag, on the plane. But I'm certainly not complaining, given the janitorial staff and airline workers still on duty as before.  I travel often — or I did before the pandemic — but I don't believe I've ever stayed in an entirely empty hotel. The front desk manager told me only one other room was occupied, which was for my colleague Jake Carpenter, a CNN photojournalist. I limited my trip to one night and ordered pizza and salad from a nearby restaurant in East Lansing.  Hertz rental? Open and easy.  Coronavirus journalism  ZW: Third, how do you interview people in person and social distance?  JZ: I mainly just observed people at the rally, having conversations with only a couple people from a respectable distance. Their hand-made signs made their opinions easily known.  The Detroit airport on April 16.  I traveled to Lansing to interview the governor, which we did from six feet away in two chairs, with two cameras. I spent time in her office, where I also stayed at a safe distance.  And this is what the Detroit airport looks like as I fly back to Washington. The only person you can see in this picture is President Trump on the television.  Heading toward a new normal, or dystopia?  It sounds like science fiction. But this is real. CNN's Ray Sanchez tried to envision what life will be like in the near term. What was most striking was his description of how contact tracing -- tracking whether you've come into contact with the disease -- could work in practice.  Forget about privacy. The tracing of people with regard to coronavirus is underway in China and some other places. In China, the use of a color-coded badge on your phone dictates where you can go. So the question for the US and other countries is whether people will have to prove their health to return to normal ways of life.  Don't trust. Verify. Want to eat in a restaurant? You'll essentially have to prove that you're clean. Want to get on a plane? You might have to take a test.  This is Orwell come to life. It's a Philip K. Dick-level societal shift. Is that person walking next to you infected? Do you have a right to know? I'd take an online philosophy course on the future of privacy.  It's like the movie " Gattaca ," where Ethan Hawke's character buys blood from Jude Law so that he can deceive authorities about his genetic deficiency and take part in society.  Low-tech alternatives -- Sanchez, borrowing from some reports and suggestions, includes these ideas for the near term:  Staggered school days and smaller class sizes  Disposable menus and masked servers  Empty stadiums and concert halls  Tracking of location and other personal information  Who got it right?  Every country has experienced coronavirus somewhat differently, but some have escaped much of the death, as well as the social and economic upheaval, that has characterized the US experience. CNN looked at what Taiwan, Germany, Iceland and South Korea did differently. This is a long story and worth reading . But the 12 key lessons appear to be:  Be prepared Be quick Test, trace and quarantine Use data and tech Be aggressive Get the private sector involved Act preventatively Respect privacy Make drive-thru tests available Learn from mistakes Test even more after restrictions ease Build capacity at hospitals  The reality is that the world has seen a series of disease outbreaks in recent years -- SARS, Ebola, Zika. So the big question for this country now is how much we can learn from the Covid-19 experience and what we do to get ourselves better prepared for the next time.
2020-04-16	The federal Bureau of Prisons has notified Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney, that he will be released early from prison due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to people familiar with the matter and his lawyer.  Cohen is serving a three-year sentence at the federal prison camp in Otisville, New York, where 14 inmates and seven staff members at the complex have tested positive for the virus.  Cohen was scheduled for release in November 2021, but he will be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence from home confinement, the people said. He will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine at the prison camp before he is released.  Some background on Cohen: He pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. He admitted to helping facilitate hush money payments to two women who alleged past affairs with Trump. When pleading guilty, Cohen implicated Trump, telling a federal judge that he made the payments “in coordination with and at the direction of” Trump, who prosecutors identified in court filings as “Individual 1.”  A vocal Trump surrogate: Cohen had been a vocal surrogate for Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, often sparring with reporters and appearing on television to support his long-time client.

2020-04-16	Hong Kong (CNN) At the beginning of the year, parts of east Asia were a somewhat scary place to be.  The coronavirus was spreading rapidly across mainland China and its neighbors, with cases reported in South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and beyond. Western governments began evacuating citizens from Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, and many foreign nationals began fleeing the region, holing up in their home countries.  Now that situation has almost entirely reversed -- with the notable exception of Japan and Singapore, east Asian governments have reported a steady drop in new cases and are gradually beginning to relax lockdown measures . As the situation has grown increasingly dire in the West, Asia now feels like one of the safest places in the world.  Some of that is simply down to time -- Asia has been dealing with the coronavirus since late last year, so governments have had longer to respond, and waves of infections have risen and fallen. Europe and the US are in the relative early stages of their outbreaks and numbers can be expected to slow there, too, in the coming weeks and months.  But this explanation misses one fact: the West didn't have to go through the same cycles as Asia, where governments and public health systems had little warning of the virus and scrambled to understand it while reacting to outbreaks.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday confirmed reports that calls to implement life-saving social distancing measures faced "a lot of pushback" early in the US outbreak and said the country is looking to respond more effectively to the virus should it rebound in the fall.  In Asia, there is a growing sense of astonishment that the long lead time many countries elsewhere had was not better used. This is particularly the case in China, where state-backed media has been pushing a narrative that the country's response to the virus saved the world from a much worse pandemic, and that sacrifices made by the Chinese people were squandered by the poor handling of governments in the West.  Many of those governments have been keen to lay all blame for the virus at Beijing's door, but while initial coverups and lack of transparency undoubtedly delayed the international response, by February at the latest, much of what we know about the virus -- including its severity and ability to spread quickly -- was widely known, and yet countries still failed, or refused, to act.  JUST WATCHED Italian newspaper's obituaries filled 1 page. Now it's 13. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Italian newspaper's obituaries filled 1 page. Now it's 13. 03:56  Someone else's problem  While it is easy to forget now that the coronavirus has exploded into a global pandemic, at first, the worst of the outbreak did appear to be contained to China, with most deaths seen in Wuhan, at least in part because of the city's overwhelmed healthcare system.  Sporadic outbreaks beyond mainland China did not see the same levels of fatalities as in Wuhan. And there was not the kind of rapid spread inside China that later came in Europe and the US.  "I think the penny hadn't dropped that it really was going to keep spreading," said Benjamin Cowling, a professor at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health. "In Hong Kong, we picked up all these cases, and then we checked their contacts, and it didn't seem to be that contagious. There was a view that maybe outside of China infections wouldn't spread as easily."  Cowling added that "it was only about a month later, particularly when northern Italy had this surge in cases, that suddenly it was recognized that there could be a lot of transmission under the radar."  But while authorities and experts were certainly taken unawares by how quickly and widely the virus spread itself, multiple experts agreed there was also a general sense of complacency among governments in the West that the outbreak was a China -- or an Asian -- problem, and would not necessarily behave the same way inside their borders.  "There's often a feeling in countries that they might be affected in a different way because their community has a different structure ... or that hot weather is going to keep it away, or their community is more spread out" Cowling said. "But I think what we're discovering is that Covid-19 is affecting everywhere in the world."  Nadia Abuelezam, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Boston College's Connell School of Nursing, said that "despite a number of scientists warning (the US) leadership that an epidemic of this scale could happen, little was done to prepare."  She put this down, in part, to the underfunding of the US healthcare system, but more broadly "there is still a great deal of stigma and xenophobia in society that public health officials and other members of society are trying to fight."  "Unfortunately, this stigma has caused a slow response and has resulted in a large number of deaths and infections around the world," she added.  Failure to act  For all the blame laid at China's door for its failure to act early in the pandemic, officials there did not know what they were dealing with.  By comparison, officials in Europe and the US knew exactly what they were facing once the outbreak reached their borders, but were often slow to react, wasting time as the virus spread through Asia and ignoring lessons learned by other countries.  Much of what we know about the coronavirus -- that it is highly contagious and spreads from person to person , that it has a relatively high mortality rate , particularly for certain populations, and that one of the best ways to contain it is via enforced social distancing -- was established by early February.  Despite this, Western governments, particularly the US and UK, were staggeringly slow to act.  It didn't have to be this way: as early as January 21, when even authorities in Beijing were only just ramping up national efforts against the virus, across the Taiwan strait, their counterparts in Taipei were introducing new restrictions on travelers from mainland China . They would continue to roll out new measures in the weeks that followed, which have been successful in containing the virus' spread on the island.  This cannot be put down to a lack of information on the part of the UK and US. Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and has publicly complained of a lack of data sharing as a result of this (a charge the organization denies). It was nevertheless able to institute a world-class response based on the information publicly available.  New Zealand, another government which has been praised for its handling of the pandemic, was also faster to introduce restrictions and widespread testing than Washington or London.  "We have the same access to the same knowledge as you do -- the whole world has seen this coming, it's like a slow-moving tsunami, it hasn't changed its characteristics at all, and the virus is very stable," Professor Michael Baker, who helped advise the New Zealand government on its response, told CNN last week  Nor has every country in the West been as slow to respond as the UK and US. Germany has been praised for its response -- maintaining a low number of deaths despite a soaring infection toll, thanks in part to a well-funded, universal healthcare system and widespread testing allowing people to receive treatment or be isolated as needed.  JUST WATCHED Inside a Hong Kong isolation center Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside a Hong Kong isolation center 02:01  The last war  It's a well worn cliche that armies fail when they attempt to fight the last war in the next, but responses to crises are equally shaped by past experience, regardless of how much we try to look beyond them.  From the get-go, the current pandemic was seen as a rerun of SARS, from its emergence in China, to that government's apparent attempt at a coverup, to how it spread through Asia. The two viruses are related, and have similar symptoms, but the novel coronavirus has long overtaken SARS in terms of death toll and spread.  Nevertheless, an inability to look beyond SARS may have shaped responses in both positive and negative ways. In east Asia, which was badly affected by the 2003 outbreak, it put governments and the public on greater guard, with people faster to wear face masks and exercise social distancing  Taiwan was hard hit by SARS, and its fast response to the current pandemic was led by the National Health Command Center (NHCC), a top-level coordinating body established in 2004.  But while SARS may have led to faster action in one part of the world, the 2003 outbreak may have led officials elsewhere to take the opposite approach.  "I would have expected more rapid response considering we've dealt with SARS and MERS and other recent health threats," Henry F. Raymond, associate professor and epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health, said of the US handling of the coronavirus. "But based on the same experiences where those outbreaks were relatively slow moving and mostly quickly contained may have contributed to more complacency than warranted."  That complacency, combined with calls to preserve the economy at all costs, appears to have caused some officials to refuse to see what was staring them in the face, or being shouted in their ears by increasingly desperate scientific advisers.  Even in Hong Kong, Cowling said that he could not quite bring himself to believe that this virus was going to be so much worse that what we had seen previously.  "Scientifically, I knew that it was spreading. But I still didn't really I didn't know how to say it," he said. "I distinctly remember there was one article that I wrote where I changed the word 'pandemic' to something like 'global epidemic' because it felt like nobody would believe me if I said it was going to be a pandemic."
2020-04-16	A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here  London (CNN Business) The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is entering a new phase . More and more of the world's biggest economies are taking tentative steps to restart vital industries and allow some people to return to work.  Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said Germany would gradually ease some restrictions on business starting next week, and Volkswagen announced a phased reopening of its European plants.  Spain, Italy, Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic are also lifting some lockdown measures. In Asia, where the pandemic originated, China and South Korea continue to ease restrictions on public life and work.  These examples have helped boost global stock markets in recent weeks. But there are still plenty of reasons for caution: new outbreaks could emerge, forcing governments to impose lockdowns for a second time, and consumers could come out the other side with very different habits.  "This will be anything but a V-shaped recovery," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told my colleague Matt Egan . "We'll get out of the gates fast when businesses start to open. But we'll be right in the quicksand because everyone will have an eye on the second wave."  When to get back to work has become a huge debate in the United States, where President Donald Trump is preparing to unveil new federal guidelines meant to begin the process of reopening the country.  The current federal guidelines on social distancing are not expected to be renewed when they expire on April 30. US officials said the White House would work closely with states to ensure reopening efforts are done safely and only when local outbreaks are deemed contained.  Many states are not ready to reopen. Some have already extended their own social distancing guidelines past May 1.  The scary part: Nobody can say with authority whether these plans can be safely executed, or how quickly economies will come back online.  Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist who advises the British government, said Thursday that some restrictions are likely to remain in place even if the government is able to reduce the number of new infections.  "It's not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some level of social distancing — a significant level of social distancing — probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available," he told the BBC.  On Thursday, investors will get another look at how much damage has already been done to the US economy.  Nearly 17 million people have filed for initial unemployment benefits since the middle of March, as businesses closed to minimize the spread of the virus. Thursday's data is expected to show another 5.1 million people filed claims in the week ended April 11.  Developing economies need urgent help  The trauma caused by the pandemic in developed economies has been well documented. Now, the International Monetary Fund is warning about the impact on poorer countries.  More than 100 countries so far have asked for emergency assistance, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, told a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors on Wednesday.  Georgieva said the IMF is ready to use its "full toolbox and $1 trillion firepower" of lending capacity, noting that 10 countries have so far received emergency funding, and half of the remaining countries should receive their requested financial lifelines by the end of April.  The IMF head said "everything is on the table in terms of measures we can take," and encouraged central banks to "spend as much as you can."  "But keep the receipts," she added. "We don't want accountability and transparency to take a back seat in this crisis."  Reminder: The IMF expects global GDP will contract by 3% in 2020, a far worse recession than the one that followed the global financial crisis of 2008.  The rise of the video game coach  My colleague Shannon Liao has uncovered an interesting trend: Some people who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic are becoming video game coaches  One example: Trevor Andrews is a concert violist and music teacher who found his symphony performances canceled in late March. The private lessons he gave dried up as his clients cut back on their spending.  The 30-year-old resident of South Portland, Maine, is also an avid gamer who considers himself an expert at the shooter game "Apex Legends." So he decided to pivot from classical music to teaching online customers how to survive the virtual shoot-outs that have made the game an online hit.  "I'm good at explaining things," said Andrews. "Just like when I'm practicing the viola ... You're always self critiquing, and you're always figuring out what you're doing wrong and how to get better."  Up next  US initial claims data will be published at 8:30 a.m. ET, along with reports on housing starts and building permits for March.

2020-04-16	A version of this story appeared in the April 16 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) President Donald Trump has been eager to reopen America ever since it shut down. Today, he will try to kickstart that process when he unveils new guidelines telling states they can ease restrictions at the discretion of their governors in the coming days.  "We will be the comeback kids, all of us, all of us. It's incredible what's going on," Trump said yesterday . But governors actually make the call on whether to reopen their states -- and with many states only just at or past their coronavirus peaks, some of them are less than enthused.  Multiple governors say their states are nowhere close to reopening, and even New York -- where the curve is flattening -- has now ordered residents to wear face coverings in public.  Despite the optimism pouring out of the Rose Garden yesterday, more bad news for the US economy is on its way this morning, when new data is expected to show that another 5.1 million people have filed initial unemployment claims  As Trump tries to pry America open with one eye on the economy and the other on November, a lesson may lie thousands of miles away in South Korea , where the ruling party romped to a landslide election victory after waging a successful battle against the outbreak.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: Is it too early to be planning future travel?  A: It may not be. You can start planning and booking today, depending on your flexibility, risk tolerance and willingness to take an active role in following the latest developments.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  What Trump can learn from Merkel  As Trump battles with governors over who can open what and when, there's a lesson to be taken from Germany, where federalism is as entrenched as it is in the United States.  Chancellor Angela Merkel cannot force the governors of her 16 states to enforce social distancing measures or close schools. But she's worked closely with state leaders who have helped shape the country's common approach, Frederik Pleitgen writes. And yesterday, Merkel announced that Germany was ready to start carefully lifting its lockdown.  As governments fumble, these 4 got it right  In our globalized world, it's puzzling that so few lessons were learned in the early weeks of different countries' outbreaks, when the chances of containing and stopping the virus were highest. Now the focus is on flattening the curve to keep death tolls from climbing further.  As much of the world mulls gradually lifting lockdowns, there are still things we can learn from some of the places that got it right, from Iceland to South Korea. Angela Dewan highlights 12 of those lessons.  Virus piles on the pain for India's 'untouchables'  India's caste system was officially abolished in 1950, but the 2,000-year-old social system imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. Now there are fears that the country's lockdown measures are worsening the segregation of the Dalits, or "untouchables," at the bottom of the hierarchy, Priyali Sur writes.  Sea you after this all blows over  While most people across the globe under lockdown are hunkering down in their houses or apartments, some uber rich people are choosing to ride the pandemic out on their luxury yachts.

TOP TIPS  Social distancing, gym closures and home confinement may tempt you to just curl up on the couch and binge-watch Netflix. But regular exercise is essential for supporting healthy immune function, especially during this pandemic. Dr. Melina Jampolis has these tips for working out at home:  No equipment at home? No worries. There are a number of online streaming services and apps that offer free or low-cost at-home workouts, like barre or yoga. Another indoor fitness idea: "housewalking." Don't forget about your kids. Involving the whole family can help keep you accountable, and be a welcome diversion from isolation. A daily workout can start today. Some ways to get started: squats, reverse lunges, kneeling push ups and one-arm rows.

2020-04-16	London (CNN) Like a line of dominoes, country after country has been shut down by the novel coronavirus . Despite signs the threat was making its way across the globe , there was a clear pattern of response in many parts of the world -- denial, fumbling and, eventually, lockdown.  In our globalized world, it's puzzling that so few lessons were learned in the early weeks of each country's outbreak, when the chances of containing and stopping the virus were highest. Now the focus is on flattening the curve, or slowing the virus' spread, to keep death tolls from climbing further.  As much of the world mulls gradually lifting lockdowns, there are still lessons to be learned from these four places that got it right. Here are 12 of those lessons.  Taiwan  Sitting just 180 kilometers (110 miles) off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan's outbreak could have been disastrous. At the end of January, the island was estimated to have had the second-highest number of cases in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).  But Taiwan, with a population of around 24 million people, has recorded just over 390 cases and six deaths, and yesterday, it reported no new cases at all. It's managed to do that without implementing severe restrictions , like lockdowns, or prolonged school and nursery closures.  In terms of its death toll, at least, Taiwan doesn't even have much of a curve to flatten, more of a line with a couple of rigid steps.  Compare that to the United States -- now the world's hardest-hit nation, at least in raw numbers -- which has reported at least 26,000 deaths. Even when you take population size into account, a level of success like Taiwan's could have meant just 83 deaths in the US.  Lesson #1: Be prepared  Taiwan's preparedness came largely from some hard-learned lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which killed 181 people on the island.  As a result, the island established a specialized Central Epidemic Command Center, which could be activated to coordinate a response in the event of an outbreak. In a sign of how Taiwan wanted to get ahead of the coronavirus, the center was activated on January 20, a day before the island even confirmed its first infection.  Because its authority was already established, the center was able to implement stringent measures without being slowed down by lengthy political processes. It put more than 120 action items into place within three weeks, according to a list published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That list alone could serve as a manual on exactly what to do during an outbreak.  Lesson #2: Be quick  Taiwan's action came well before its first Covid-19 infection was confirmed on January 21. Three weeks before, within days of China's first reported case to the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwanese officials began boarding and inspecting passengers for fever and pneumonia symptoms on flights from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus in China. The island issued a travel alert for Wuhan on January 20, and two days later, still with just a single case, officials began updating the public in daily briefings.  A week after its first case, Taiwan began electronic monitoring of quarantined individuals via government-issued cell phones, and announced travel and entry restrictions, mostly targeting China's Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Just about every day after until the end of February, the government implemented new measures to keep the virus at bay.  Taiwan had only 329 cases when it imposed strict social distancing measures on April 1. In comparison, there were already 335 deaths and more than 3,000 cases on March 20, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that pubs and restaurants were to close, and that most children would be pulled from schools and nurseries. And as the UK is not testing widely , the true number of infections is believed to be much higher than official figures show.  Soldiers from the military's chemical units take part in a drill to help slow the coronavirus' spread in the Xindian district near Taipei on March 14  Lesson #3: Test, trace and quarantine  Authorities carried out widespread testing and tracing the contacts of infected people, putting them all under quarantine. It proactively tested anyone who got off cruise ships and even retested people diagnosed with influenza or pneumonia, to make sure they hadn't been misdiagnosed and were infected with coronavirus.  Lesson #4: Use data and tech  "A coordinated government response with full collaboration of its citizenry [was] combined with the use of big data and technology," associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, Jason Wang, told CNN. Wang has also studied public health policy and co-authored the JAMA report on Taiwan's response.  Taiwan merged national health insurance data with customs and immigration databases to create real-time alerts to help identify vulnerable populations.  "Having a good health data system helps with monitoring the spread of the disease and allows for its early detection. When someone sees a physician for respiratory symptoms, the national health insurance database will have a record of it. It is easier to track clusters of outbreaks," Wang said.  Taiwan used mandatory online reporting and check-ins for 14 days after travel restrictions. It also employed "digital fencing" for close to 55,000 people in home quarantine, where alarms would sound if a quarantined person wandered too far from home. The technical surveillance methods used in Taiwan and by other governments have raised privacy concerns from civil society groups.  Iceland  Getting a coronavirus test in many countries can be near impossible, unless you're already very ill. Not so in Iceland, where anyone who wants a test gets one. Widespread testing has been crucial to the country's low number of infections and deaths, authorities there say. Only around 1,700 people have been infected in Iceland, and only eight have died.  Lesson #5: Be aggressive  Iceland's response to the coronavirus hasn't been particularly innovative. It's just been meticulous and quick. Like Taiwan, its speed has meant it hasn't had to be too restrictive -- people can still meet in groups of up to 20, if they stay two meters away from each other. While universities are closed, schools and nurseries are still open, allowing more parents to work.  "From the beginning, since we diagnosed our first case, we worked according to our plan. Our plan was to be aggressive in detecting and diagnosing individuals, putting them into isolation, and to be very aggressive in our contact tracing. We used the police force and the healthcare system to sit down and contact trace every newly diagnosed case," Iceland's chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason told CNN.  "We are finding that above 60% of new cases are in people already quarantined. So that showed that contact tracing and quarantining contacts was a good move for us," Gudnason said.  Saebraut road in the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, on April 3, as a ban on gatherings of more than 20 people is in effect.  Lesson #6: Get the private sector involved  In a public-private partnership between the National University Hospital of Iceland and biotech company deCODE Genetics, Iceland designed tests early and expects to have tested 10% of its population by the end of this week. It aims to test just about everyone and has already become a valuable laboratory for the world to learn more about the novel virus.  Recent revelations that 50% of the people who tested positive in a lab in Iceland showed no symptoms at all, for example, has prompted other countries to take firmer action through social distancing, as they begin to realize preventing the virus' spread will be more challenging than initially thought.  Kári Stefánsson, CEO and director of deCODE Geneticsm, told CNN that as of Monday, it had found 528 mutations of the coronavirus in mass testing in the community. These mutations could give insight to how lethal the virus becomes and offers important data to the world to better understand how it operates.  Lesson #7: Act preventatively  Icelandic Health Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir has emphasized speed as a powerful tool, saying the approach is to stay "ahead of the curve." The country appears to have done just that. After just six imported cases were confirmed on March 3, Iceland immediately issued quarantine measures for all travelers returning from Italy, and increased travel restrictions in the following weeks.  The National Police Commissioner declared a state of emergency on March 6 , when the first two community-transmitted infections were confirmed. This sent a signal to government bodies to improve their preparedness, but it kept public gatherings as they were, only warning vulnerable people to stay away from crowded places.  The country closed universities and junior colleges on March 13 and banned gatherings of more than 100 people on March 16, when it had just 61 confirmed cases and not a single death.  Three days later, all Icelandic residents that entered the country were required to go into 14 days of quarantine, regardless of where they were traveling from.  It wasn't until after all this action that, on March 24, Iceland's first death was reported. That same day, authorities banned gatherings of above 20 people and shut down public amenities, such as bars, swimming pools, museums and gyms.  Lesson #8: Use tech, but respect privacy  Like in Taiwan, Icelandic officials also made an app available for people to download to help chart the virus' spread. It creates a log of where the user has been. Users don't have to share that data with authorities -- but many do as it helps contact-tracing teams work out who may have been put at risk.  In comparison, the UK's response has been slow. A government-supported app is only now in the works and is weeks away from launching. As it lags behind in testing, it is only just now looking into public-private partnerships.  South Korea  It's telling that South Korea reported its first coronavirus case at around the same time as the US and UK. South Korea is confirming around 30 new cases a day, while in the UK it's around 5,000, and the US it's more than 20,000.  The way each country tests varies, but their death rates among the population contrast just as dramatically. Fewer than one in every 100,000 people in South Korea's population have died from the virus, while in the UK it's around 18. It's almost eight in every 100,000 in the US, JHU data shows.  Lesson #9: You can drive-through test  South Korea's success has been largely down to its testing, according to Dr. Eom Joong Sik from the Gil Medical Center near Seoul. Eom is treating coronavirus patients in hospital and sits on a committee that advises the government in its response.  "Early diagnosis, early quarantine and early treatment are key," he told CNN.  "Since the first patient was confirmed, by installing more than 500 screening clinics all over the country, we sorted suspected cases and conducted tests, and we have worked hard to develop and maintain a system to conduct many tests with a small workforce over a short period of time," he said.  The country has also been innovative in how it tests. Eom's advisory team had hundreds of drive-through booths, just like at a McDonald's, set up across the country to offer tests that were largely free, quick and done by staff at a safe distance. The US has since replicated that model in some states.  On March 16, the WHO called on governments of the world to "test, test, test." South Korea had already been doing that for weeks, and has to date tested more than 500,000 people , among the highest number in the world per capita.  Medical staff guide drivers with suspected coronavirus symptoms at a drive-thru testing facility in Goyang, north of Seoul, on February 29.  Many countries are struggling to carry out thousands of tests each day. It's so difficult to get tested in the UK, for example, that people have been turning to mail-order kits , in an industry that hasn't yet been regulated by the government.  South Korea was also quick to move, implementing quarantining and screening measures for people arriving from Wuhan on January 3, more than two weeks before the country's first infection was even confirmed. Authorities rolled out a series of travel restrictions over the weeks after.  South Korea has also been rigorous in its contact tracing, though it was able to do that easily when it realized a large number of cases could be traced to one religious group in the city of Daegu , making contact tracing easier and giving authorities a specific area to carry out intensive testing.  "By carrying out tests on all members of the congregation and diagnosing even infected people without symptoms, the government carried out quarantine and treatment side by side," Eom said.  Once Daegu was established as the epicenter, authorities were ready with the ability and political will to test broadly, to trace contacts of people infected, and to quarantine them to try and contain the virus before it became a case of mitigating widescale death, as is now the case in much of Europe and the US.  Lesson #10: Learn from the past  South Korea was able to move quickly because, like Taiwan and many other Asian nations, it had been burned before. South Korea was mostly unaffected by the SARS outbreak, only reporting three cases and no deaths at all . But it was caught off guard by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015, when it recorded 186 cases and 38 deaths , making it the worst-impacted country outside the Middle East.  So the political will needed to enforce measures during the coronavirus outbreak wasn't a problem and there was good coordination between the central government and the provinces.  It also helped that South Korea is one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world. Much of life there is already conducted online, so developing and enforcing the use of an app to monitor people in quarantine wasn't too difficult, though activists there too have warned of invasion of privacy.  Germany  Germany's case is a little different. The country hasn't really been able to keep infection numbers at bay much better than some of the hardest-hit nations. It currently has more than 132,000 confirmed infections, the fifth-highest in the world, JHU reports.  But Germany has been able to keep the death rate in its population relatively low. More than 3,400 people have died from the virus in Germany, around four people in every 100,000 across the country. That's well below Italy's 35 and the UK's 18.  Lesson #11: Test more as restrictions ease  Germany's success has also been its mass testing, but its well-resourced universal healthcare system has played a major role too, according to Martin Stürmer, a virologist who heads IMD Labor in Frankfurt, one of the labs conducting tests. Germany has also drawn in the private sector to make sure enough tests are carried out.  "From the beginning, Germany didn't stick to one or two or three central labs doing all the tests. Many private companies were involved, so we've been able to do 100,000 tests a day," Stürmer told CNN.  "There are some countries that have done it even better than Germany, in controlling infections, but what's quite important is broad testing, where we were able to see what was happening in our population. Only with mass testing can you identify people who might be infected."  Newly installed hospital beds for coronavirus patients at the Hannover Messe trade fair grounds in Germany on April 4. The facility has 500 beds for patients who do not need intensive care.  Like Taiwan, South Korea and Iceland, Germany devised a test for the coronavirus and prepared a large number of kits early, well before the country even reported its first death.  As German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Wednesday that the country would begin gradually scaling back its lockdown, the country is planning on carrying out even more tests, in case the increased contact leads to a second wave of infections. Like many countries, it will also test for antibodies to try and determine who among the community may be immune to the virus.  Germany's death toll has remained relatively low in part because the coronavirus trickled into the country mostly in young people. Many had been visiting Italy or Austria on ski trips.  Authorities were able to test people returning to Germany from these ski resorts and trace their contacts for testing too. Most of those people were young, and still today, the biggest age group by infections is 35-59, followed by 15-34 . The virus is proving to be deadlier among the elderly around the world.  But as communal infections in the country grow, Stürmer fears that more elderly people could die in coming weeks and that the country's death rate will go up.  Germany recorded 315 deaths from complications related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the country's center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute, wrote on its website on Thursday. This is the first time more than 300 deaths have been reported in a 24-hour span.  Lesson #12: Build capacity at hospitals  Germany ranks 18th in the world in terms of access to quality healthcare, according to an index published by The Lancet, sitting above the UK at 23rd and the US at 29th. But these indices only tell us so much. Italy, for example, ranks ninth and the country also carried out rigorous testing, yet it has recorded the second-highest number of deaths per capita in the world, after Spain.  In this situation, the difference appears to be the German healthcare system's huge capacity. Germany is projected to need about 12,000 beds at the peak of this outbreak in the middle of the month, according to projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. It has over 147,000, more than 10 times its need.  In contrast, the US has around 94,000 beds, some 15,000 beds short of its need . Germany has more spare beds in intensive care units that Italy has altogether.  In fact, Germany's health system has such a large capacity, its hospitals are now treating people for coronavirus from Italy, Spain and France.  Authorities have been able to get people with even moderate symptoms to hospital well before their conditions deteriorate, leading some experts to consider whether treating people early, getting them on ventilators before their condition worsens, for example, improves their chances for survival.  "Germany is not in a situation where the healthcare system is overloaded, like you see in Italy, where they need to decide whether to treat a patient or not. We don't have that," Stürmer said.
2020-04-16	(CNN) The new normal will be anything but ordinary.  As the United States combats the coronavirus pandemic, the timeline for reopening the country in a bid to jump start the economy remains unclear. But dramatic changes to daily life are coming into view -- from mass temperature checks and mandatory use of face masks to empty sports and entertainment venues to Orwellian government monitoring of cellphone location and other personal information.  "You can call it the 'new normal,'" said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst and former assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. "I call it the 'now normal' because I think every day is going to be different."  Here's how life could change as states consider modifying stay-at-home orders and other restrictions:  Staggered school days and smaller class sizes  How US schools are responding to the coronavirus pandemic  How US schools are responding to the coronavirus pandemic 03:24  How US schools are responding to the coronavirus pandemic  In California, like many other states that have virtually shut down, the reopening of schools is a priority.  "We need to get our kids back to school. I need to get my kids back to school," California Gov. Gavin Newsom said with a chuckle on Tuesday.  It's too soon to loosen restrictions on schools, Newsom said. When students do return to the classroom, likely in the fall, the educational environment will be dramatically different.  State officials are consulting unions and administrators about steps such as staggered school schedules,and changes to assemblies, physical education and recess. Increased sanitization efforts and deep cleaning will become standard in schools.  "We talk about what the new normal looks like. Normal it will not be," Newsom said.  Floor plans conducive to physical distancing will be in place.  "At the end of the initial quarantine period, schools could reopen with daily temperature checks for students and staff, as well as weekly testing, so that any new outbreaks could be rapidly identified and contained," wrote the authors of paper for the Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University.  "The risk for a second wave comes in the fall when the kids get back in school," said George Rutherford, an infectious disease expert at University of California San Francisco.  "You could have 9th and 10th grades come in the morning and 11th to 12th grades in the afternoon," said Rutherford, who has worked with San Francisco health officials on the city's response. "Or half of the students could come Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The other half on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday."  Disposable menus and masked servers  JUST WATCHED Meals here can cost $700. Now this restaurant feeds the homeless Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meals here can cost $700. Now this restaurant feeds the homeless 01:59  Restaurants will likely cut down the number of seats. Mask-wearing diners could be greeted by servers in masks and gloves with disposable menus in their hands.  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN, "Restaurants may have to be a lot less crowded to begin. We've got to take it slow."  And restaurant goers could have their temperatures checked before sitting down.  Empty stadiums and concert halls  Barring a vaccine, a pharmaceutical intervention or herd immunity, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said mass gatherings such as concerts and sporting events are unlikely until next year.  "The prospect of mass gatherings is negligible at best," Newsom said this week.  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the return of such events could be far off.  "The last thing we should do is gather, you know, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 people in one place," he said. "That's, like, the exact opposite of social distancing. We shouldn't do that until we're really sure that we're out of this crisis."  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN Wednesday night that he had spoken with Mets owner Fred Wilpon.  "I said, 'Why can't we talk about a baseball season with nobody in the stands? Why can't you play the game with the players?'" he said. "Look, it would be good for the country. It would be good for people to have something to watch and do to fight cabin fever. It's something I'm going to pursue."  But Major League Baseball would first have to strike deal with the players union.  "If you have no one in the stands then the numbers are going to change, the economics are going to change," Cuomo said. "If Major League Baseball and the players can come to an agreement on how to adjust the economics for that reality ... that would be a good thing."  Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, may be empty for awhile.  "We want to get our sports back, so importantly," Trump said at his coronavirus briefing Tuesday.  "I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old, but I haven't had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter and then get back to work."  In South Korea, where the number of new coronavirus cases has been dropping, the country's baseball league is preparing to start its 144-game season in early May, according to South Korea's Yonhap news.  Intra-sqaud games, with some players in masks, have been played in empty stadiums in a country where spectators are known for dancing in the stands.  "There's actually a picture from summer season of 1918," Rutherford said, referring to the Spanish flu pandemic more than a century ago. "I think it was the Oakland Oaks, a Pacific Coast League team, and everybody's wearing masks, including the umpire, the catcher and the batter."  Still, baseball in the US may be some time away. Some players have even expressed a willingness to wear masks on the field.  Rutherford recalled a conversation with an A's beat writer, who told him: "Have you ever been in a major league dugout after a game? It's just disgusting. People spit everywhere. Ugh."  Or imagine New Orleans without spring and summer festivals.  New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said she believes the city's biggest events -- French Quarter Festival, JazzFest and Essence Festival -- will not happen until next year.  Tracking of location and other personal information  In China, authorities are using technology to track healthy people -- and those who pose a risk.  Residents are assigned color-coded QR codes on their phones . The color determines what they're able to do. In Wuhan, China, where the lockdown has been lifted, residents need to produce a green QR code on their phones to leave their homes.  To get into places such as restaurants, people need to show a green QR code.  Harvard's Safra Center said people not in a "high-risk" population could move about freely. Their location on public transport could be tracked on "privacy-protective QR scanning."  Additionally, the center's paper said, thermal scanning devices in public spaces "can help spot outbreaks and support contact tracing" -- tracking down sick people, isolating them and then tracing everyone with whom they've been in contact and putting those people into quarantine.  A report by the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank said home isolation can be enforced using GPS tracking on phone apps.  A plan from the liberal Center for American Progress called for a "trusted, nonprofit organization" to host the medical data -- "not private technology companies or the federal government." The information must be automatically deleted after 45 days.  Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, said South Korea is using "very aggressive" contact tracing which looks into personal credit cards and phone records and car GPS information.  "The reality is your credit card company is already using this on you," he said. "You signed it when you signed the contract that was in the fine print there, and they were using for whatever the heck they wanted to do with it to make money. And your phone is already using it. That's what all the phone companies do, they track you. And lots of other apps on your phones do also."  Changes at airports and limited travel  Monitoring of international travelers is being recommended by the American Enterprise Institute, which is also urging the public to limit unnecessary travel.  The Center for American Progress calls for nonessential travel to be prohibited outright during the stay-at-home phase: "State and local governments must use aggregated, anonymized cellular data to assess compliance with stay-at-home orders and determine whether targeted enforcement is necessary."  Airline passengers should be required to have the contact tracing app, confirm no proximity to a positive case, and have a temperature check or show documentation of immunity, according to the liberal think tank.  Dr. Lee Riley, a professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at University of California, Berkeley, said, "People are discovering that a lot of business trips or small conferences can be actually done virtually. Travel as we'd known it, will definitely decrease, at least for the next two years."  Beverage and snack distribution probably won't change, except for the addition of alcohol wipes.  Subways, buses and transit stations should limit the number of passengers to 50% capacity, according to the Center for American Progress.  Face masks may become an everyday accessory  Get used to wearing face masks at the store.  Cuomo said Wednesday he will sign an executive order requiring New York residents to wear a mask or a mouth/nose covering in public when not social distancing.  There will be a three-day notice period before the order is enforced, allowing New Yorkers to secure masks or coverings. Cuomo said he was considering a civil penalty for those who break the rule.  During the initial phase of the reopening, people should be encouraged to wear nonmedical fabric masks in public, according to the American Enterprise Institute. Even people without symptoms.  "Face masks will be most effective at slowing the spread . . . if they are widely used, because they may help prevent people who are asymptomatically infected from transmitting the disease unknowingly," the AEI said.  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told CNN that American life will be radically altered until a vaccine is developed.  "Things are just going to be different," he said. "And that's the sad truth."
2020-04-17	(CNN) Sports of all types have been canceled around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.  But not in Taiwan.  Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium echoed with the thwack of bats hitting balls on Thursday, as the Rakuten Monkeys clobbered the Uni Lions 15 to 3.  Taiwan is still playing ball.  "That is because we did a pretty good job on the pandemic prevention," said Richard Wang, a Taiwanese broadcaster who provided live English-language commentary broadcast worldwide.  The numbers suggest he's right.  As of Friday, Taiwan, with its population of around 24 million people, had detected only 395 cases of coronavirus and just six deaths.  On Tuesday, it also reached an important milestone. No new cases were reported that day, for the first time since March 9. Grand Hotel Taipei celebrated the achievement by spelling out the word "zero" in lights on the façade of the building.  Taiwan started moving to control the virus even before the first case was reported on the island on January 24.  Taiwanese officials began boarding and inspecting passengers for fever and pneumonia symptoms on flights from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus in China.  Within three weeks, more than 120 action items had been put in place by the island's Central Epidemic Command Center, according to a list published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).  Taiwan's relative success battling the virus has allowed professional sports to be played, albeit with some adaptations. Human audiences aren't allowed in the stadium for Thursday's match-up. Instead, workers erected cardboard cut-outs and even mannequins in the stands.  "We obviously miss the audience," Wang told CNN by videophone near the dugout before the game.  Baseball games in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea are usually incredibly noisy as cheerleaders dance to booming music and lead the crowds in singalongs.  In the age of coronavirus, it's much more quiet. "But we still have the music on," Wang said. They also have robot drummers.  Overlooking the field were four metal robots, complete with glowing eyes and swiveling heads. Armed with drum sticks, they banged snare drums throughout the game.  "The club got these robot figures that play the drums during the games," Wang said. "We never saw that before. It's fun!"  Another thing Taiwan has never done before is broadcast games for free to the world -- in English.  "The only #LIVE Pro-baseball game on EARTH," announced Eleven Sports Taiwan in a tweet before Thursday's game, which was streamed live on the platform.  "We hope we can cheer up all the people who might be under the impact of coronavirus," said Simone Kang, general manager of Eleven Sports Taiwan.  "Don't feel sad ... just watch Taiwan professional baseball."  Eleven Sports Taiwan said they counted close to a million views during two games live-streamed in English this week.  Among those celebrating the start of Taiwan's professional baseball season was Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.  She posted a photo on Facebook of herself watching a league game with her cat.  "I really welcome everybody to enjoy our games especially when there's no game in the States, no game in Japan, no game in Korea, no game anywhere!" said Wang.  "This is the only live sport you can have right now."
2020-04-17	She's the lead nurse at a hospital in Saitama prefecture and is witnessing firsthand the strain on an intensive care unit that's treating critically ill coronavirus patients.  "It's hard because we think the patient is improving, but then they'll suddenly take a turn for the worse," she said.  In the past few weeks, Japan's coronavirus cases have spiked -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread. As of Friday, Japan had 9,787 confirmed cases, including 190 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. On March 1, the country had 243 cases.  The sharp increase has prompted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to extend the state of emergency from seven prefectures to the entire country. On Friday, he also promised to provide medical equipment such as surgical masks, gowns and face shields to hospitals struggling with acute gear shortages within a week.  Earlier this week, a team of government experts warned that Japan could have more than 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths if measures such as social distancing are not taken.  But most deaths, they warned, could result from a lack of ventilators.  The shortage of medical supplies became clear this week when Osaka mayor Ichiro Matsui urged people to donate unused raincoats for health workers to use as personal protective equipment, after they'd been forced to wear trash bags.  Experts say medical shortages combined with comparatively low testing rates and Japan's lack of provision for teleworking threatens to create a potentially explosive uptick in cases.  Hospital clusters  As Japan battled the virus, infection clusters are forming in hospitals, too.  On April 12, 87 new coronavirus cases were confirmed among doctors, nurses and inpatients at a hospital in Tokyo's Nakano ward, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The increase of clusters in hospitals is particularly concerning, owing to the potential for further community transmission.  "It's very important to move testing away from clinics and hospitals," said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization (WHO).  "The lack of testing in Japan led to widespread community infection. Hospital workers are not prepared as they don't know the infection status of the patient."  Medical staffs wearing protective gears hold an exercise for coronavirus outbreak at a hospital on February 7, 2020 in Tottori, Japan.  In Yokohama, paramedic Sho Hayakawa has seen a steady increase in coronavirus patients at his hospital in recent weeks. As a father, he worries about bringing the virus home to his wife and toddler. "I do worry about contracting it, but I'm being extra careful," he said.  Tokyo and Osaka have started transferring patients with mild coronavirus symptoms to hotels to alleviate the strain on hospitals, with other prefectures expected to follow suit soon. Hayakawa hopes similar measures will be implemented in Yokohama.  Anesthesiologist Mio Shin said that after her colleague had to self-quarantine because he worked with a doctor from another hospital who was suspected of having coronavirus, she took on his workload.  "Many doctors take shifts at different hospitals, so I felt like overstretched clinics across Japan were temporarily losing staff members as they unwittingly came into contact with people who didn't know they had coronavirus," Shin said.  She said that as more medical workers are needed to care for coronavirus patients, there will be fewer people to take on everything from cancer and infertility treatment to heart surgery and maternity care.  "I think people in Japan may not have realized how these absences will affect not only coronavirus treatments, but also everything from infertility and cancer treatments, as other medical workers are needed to care for coronavirus patients," Shin said.  Cluster approach under scrutiny  Since Japan recorded its first coronavirus cases in February, officials have focused on containing infection clusters rather than the widespread testing seen in countries such as neighboring South Korea.  Japan has only tested about 90,000 people, compared with more than 513,000 in South Korea, which has a population of 51 million, compared to Japan's 126 million.  Experts suspect the infection rate could already be much higher than official statistics reveal.  Japan's testing approach is geared towards pinpointing patients in need of urgent medical attention to avoid overwhelming hospitals. The country has the capacity to conduct up to 12,000 tests per day, but in reality does between 6,000 and 7,000, according to a spokesman from the ministry of health.  On Wednesday, the Tokyo metropolitan medical association announced it would establish up to 20 new testing locations. Eiji Kusumi, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, said he had already signed up to administer them. "Once testing becomes available for people with more mild symptoms, we will likely see more coronavirus cases," he said.  JUST WATCHED Japan's Shinzo Abe promotes anti-flu drug to treat virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's Shinzo Abe promotes anti-flu drug to treat virus 02:39  The government has repeatedly stressed confidence in its testing strategy.  "We are continuing to focus on the cluster approach as we are not seeing an overshoot in coronavirus cases yet," a health ministry spokesman said.  However, in some cases Japan hasn't been able to trace the cause of infection. When Tokyo recorded 197 new coronavirus cases last Saturday in its second highest single-day jump, for example, officials were unable to track down the source for 77% of the cases, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government.  "In big cities it's very difficult to contain and keep track of (infection) clusters as there will be various routes of transmission," said Shibuya, the former WHO official.  To contain clusters, health workers must interview people who have tested positive to deduce how they became infected. However, given coronavirus can survive on surfaces like doorknobs and light switches, it is often difficult to determine how people contracted the virus, Shibuya said.  The focus on containing clusters worked in the early stages when the infection rate was still low and localized, but as healthcare systems are under increasing pressure, there is an urgent need to reassess this strategy, he added.  Need to shift public messaging  Takayuki Miyazawa, a virologist at Kyoto University, said that to contain the virus, the government needs to be honest with people about what life with the virus will look like for the forseeable future: specifically, a lot of social distancing and remote working.  "Politicians are giving people too much hope and telling them to endure the state of emergency just until May 6 when it is expected to lift," said Miyazawa. "So people think all this will be over by May 6, but they haven't understood the reality -- that we have to keep having to keep up our guard up against the virus."  Lead nurse Kajiwara said her hospital established an intensive care unit dedicated to coronavirus patients in early April, but with only six beds -- half of which are occupied -- Kajiwara fears they'll soon be overwhelmed.  JUST WATCHED Japan moves to announce state of emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan moves to announce state of emergency 02:45  Nationwide, Japan only has seven ICU beds per 100,000 citizens, compared to 35 per 100,000 citizens in the US, according to the Japanese Society of Intensive Care.  There is also a concern around equipment shortages. According to information provided by the country's Society of Respiratory Medicine, there are only 22,000 ventilators for a population of over 126 million. In late February, 40% were in use.  Kajiwara said her team was doing everything possible to care for patients, knowing that some won't make it and that they themselves also run the risk of infection.  "I want to hold onto hope," she said. "The whole experience made me think that we lived so comfortably in Japan and took many things for granted. I think people are realizing what they need and what's really important to them now."
2020-04-17	(CNN) While President Donald Trump's May 1 deadline to reopen parts of the economy looms, state and local government officials, along with public health experts, are calling for contact tracing teams to start tracking coronavirus positive patients to both contain the virus and start reopening some businesses.  But with only two weeks to go, many parts of the country don't have contact tracing teams that are up to speed enough to reopen places, according to experts.  Contact tracing is a widely used method in public health that relies on identifying every person who tests positive with an infection, isolating them, and then finding anyone that person could have infected. These contacts may then be quarantined before they can spread the virus to others. It's a tedious approach, but one widely credited with stopping SARS in 2004, after that coronavirus outbreak infected nearly 8,000 people and killed close to 800 of them.  With government officials, business owners and people out of work concerned about the impact of long-term social distancing measures on the economy, public health officials say contact tracing is a necessary step needed before certain businesses can reopen and people can start to return normal activities.  Trump unveiled a three-phase return-to-normal plan to all 50 state governors on Thursday. It outlines steps each state should take once they meet a certain threshold for number of cases declining over two weeks and certain level of capacity and ability to care for all patients in hospitals. The 17-page document makes a brief mention of contact tracing, saying states should have the ability to do it, but does not offer guidance on how to do it, how many people will be needed to do it, or explain how the federal government will help build up contact tracing systems.  Many experts believe the US is nowhere near where it needs to be in its ability to contact trace Covid-positive people and those they've been in contact with. Other countries, like South Korea , have found contact tracing to be an effective method to contain their coronavirus outbreak.  More public health workers needed, experts say  study released by Johns Hopkins University last week estimates that the US needs at least 100,000 additional public health workers to assist with large-scale contact tracing efforts before a robust system can begin operating nationwide.  Anita Cicero, the deputy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a co-author of the study, said that the US will likely need more than 100,000, but the initial number is a good start to get contact tracing started in some of the more heavily impacted areas.  "We're not saying that that is the upper limit of what would be needed but we knew that it's, you know, it's a pretty ambitious goal," Cicero told CNN in a phone interview. "If we can start with that, then people could be added if needed or scaled back."  Cicero said Hopkins decided to do the study to point out what resources would be needed to effectively contact trace across the country.  "Both state public health and county local public health do not have the resources or the people that are needed to be able to do contact tracing for all identified cases," Cicero said. "So, we felt that it was important to highlight that as a critical gap and try to quantify how shorthanded are we for the contact tracing workforce."  While 100,000 additional public health workers may seem like a large number, the study points out per capita, "it is still the equivalent of less than half the number employed in Wuhan City," where the coronavirus outbreak began months ago in China.  In a report released Friday, former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the need could reach "several hundred thousand."  George Rutherford, an epidemiology professor at the University of California at San Francisco who is working on San Francisco's contact tracing program, said he believes the country probably needs closer to 300,000 public health workers to focus on contact tracing full-time.  "It has to be an absolute pillar of the response going forward. If we can get the case counts down ... to a manageable number, contact tracing is a far cleaner, far more surgical solution to keeping transmission low than really anything else at our disposal in this country," Rutherford told CNN.  But Rutherford said the US is "not at all" ready to reach that level. "We don't have enough people to do it," he said.  Rutherford noted that some who are out of work are being trained to work on San Francisco's program. While the recently unemployed workforce is a good source of people to pull from to staff these projects, it will take time to get people hired and trained to do contact tracing work, he said.  The Hopkins study estimated that Congress "will need to appropriate approximately $3.6 billion in emergency funding to state and territorial health departments," to ramp up contact tracing and pay people to do the work needed.  Contact tracing efforts ramp up in Massachusetts and San Francisco  In response to the coming need, some cities and states have started developing contact tracing systems of their own, like Rutherford's program in San Francisco. In about two weeks, San Francisco went from having only 10 people in the city's public health department working on contact tracing to about 150 people, Rutherford said.  The city government and public health department partnered with University of California San Francisco to start a contact tracing program for the city. Rutherford led a group of public health professionals from UCSF that normally work overseas but whose projects are now on hold due to the pandemic to get them trained and working on the city's contact tracing efforts. UCSF staff are trained public health professionals, so they were able to get up to speed quickly, he said.  Registered nurse Raquel Hernandez reaches in to swab a passenger for a Covid-19 test at a mobile testing site in Sulphur, Oklahoma, on Tuesday, April 14, 2020.  Rutherford said they developed a training program with the city's Department of Health and a local CDC training center in the Bay area. After training UCSF staff, Rutherford and city officials started looking for more people they could recruit to work on the program. They called on other city employees who had been furloughed to get trained. Now, they are training a group of librarians and city attorneys to become volunteer contact tracers as well.  "It's a personnel-intense activity," Rutherford said. "I think volunteers are great, but you've got to have paid staff too."  The volunteers are largely doing email, phone call and texting work remotely to keep track of people who have tested positive or come into contact with someone who has tested positive, while public health professionals manage more high-risk, in-person contact when necessary.  Massachusetts started a state-wide contact tracing initiative at the beginning of April, contracting with Partners In Health , a Boston-based non-profit organization that focuses on global public health issues. The Community Tracing Collaborative aims to hire 1,000 contact tracers to track contacts of all Covid-19 positive patients across the state and to support individuals in quarantine.  "We need to have a very significant contact tracing program in place," Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference. "From our point of view, that is a must-do with respect to anything that looks like a reopening of the commonwealth or a move towards reopening the economy. "  Partners In Health has a team of more than 200 people working on the contact tracing program, continuing to hire until they reach 1,000 employees. After Baker announced the collaboration on April 3, Dr. Joia Mukherjee, the non-profit's chief medical officer, said they received more than 900 applicants in 72 hours.  More tests will be needed to conduct contact tracing  While the contact tracing efforts in Massachusetts are a positive step, public health experts warn that the program won't be completely effective without a huge increase in testing capabilities along with the development of contact tracing systems.  "We're here to do the contact tracing, but we don't have tests. If I could scream as loud as I could, we need tests. Our area in the state has been the last to really get the attention it needs," Nancy Paull, CEO of SSTAR, an integrated primary and behavioral health care organization in Massachusetts, told CNN.  Paull's center has started a contact tracing team in Falls River, an economically depressed area with a large homeless population in the state's southeast region.  Dr. Ranu Dhillon, a researcher with the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, said that the US's testing capabilities are nowhere near where they need to be if contact tracing is to work properly.  "Based on the testing capacity we have, for example, to do something like that in New York City, there's like 8 million people in New York City. We need 8 million tests. Right now, we do about 150,000 a day," Dhillon told CNN in a phone interview. "We're orders of magnitude away from what we need to be, not that we shouldn't continue to strive to get there."  Dhillon pointed out there are still many people who are asymptomatic but have been infected with Covid-19. Without widespread testing, such people could also spread the virus.  While testing capacity is an issue, those hired for the contact tracing program in Massachusetts are separated into three types of personnel: case investigators, contact tracers and care resource managers. Mukherjee said all positions are remote and those selected are trained in two days by webinar and an interactive session, a program created in tandem by Partners in Health and the state government.  All contact is made by phone. Case investigators contact the newly diagnosed to identify who they've been within six feet of, for more than 15 minutes, in the last 14 days. A contact tracer calls each of those individuals to let them know they might have been exposed. The contact tracers ask how the potentially exposed person is feeling and if they have symptoms. They may also advise on needed medical care and help people figure out how to self-quarantine.  If people are unable to quarantine safely because they live in a multi-generational home or don't have access to their own bathroom among other issues, they are then referred to a resource manager who helps them find a place to safely self-isolate or provide them with resources to do so.  "Our work around the world has taught us that privilege and economic means allow you to be able to do things that people who are poor and more vulnerable can't do," Mukherjee told CNN.  CDC starts contact tracing pilot program in 8 states  This week, the CDC started a pilot program, sending community protection teams to eight states to ramp up contact tracing efforts, according to a federal health official with knowledge of the program. The teams will be sent to New Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho, Alaska, North Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio.  The teams will be "testing new technologies," like applications and mobile technology for contact tracing, as well as "having people do self-swabbing and evaluating how effective that is," the official told CNN. The teams will work directly with state and local health departments to support epidemiologists and labs.  The CDC often deploys teams to major public health emergencies both in the US and abroad. In 2016, the CDC's Global Rapid Response Team sent health, communications and logistics experts to 90 public health crises in the US and around the world, including outbreaks of Ebola, polio, yellow fever and cholera.  The teams can deploy on short notice and can remain in the field for months to stop health threats or to limit health threats from becoming a bigger issue.
2020-04-17	Seoul (CNN) In South Korea, health officials are trying to solve a mystery: why 163 people who recovered from coronavirus have retested positive, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  The same has been recorded in China, where some coronavirus patients tested positive after seeming to recover, although there are no official figures.  That raises the question: can you get reinfected with coronavirus?  In South Korea, the proportion of cases that retest positive is low -- of the 7,829 people who have recovered from coronavirus there, 2.1% retested positive, the KCDC said Friday. It is not clear how many of the people who have recovered have been tested again.  But patients retesting positive is still a concern around the world, including in countries like South Korea where authorities appear to have brought the outbreak under control.  Medical staff wearing protective clothing take test samples for the Covid-19 coronavirus from a foreign passenger at a virus testing booth outside Incheon international airport, west of Seoul, on April 1, 2020.  KCDC deputy director Kwon Joon-wook said that so far, there's no indication that patients who retest positive are contagious, even though about 44% of them showed mild symptoms.  But he cautioned there is still a lot scientists don't know about the virus, including the issue of naturally acquired immunity.  "Covid-19 is the most challenging pathogen we may have faced in recent decades," Kwon said. "It is a very difficult and challenging enemy."  Finding remnants of the virus?  For now, the most likely explanation of why people are retesting positive seems to be that the test is picking up remnants of the virus.  The KCDC has re-investigated three cases from the same family where patients tested positive after recovering, Kwon says.  In each of these cases, scientists tried to incubate the virus but weren't able to -- that told them there was no live virus present.  Like many countries, South Korea uses a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test for the virus. The RT-PCR test works by finding evidence of a virus's genetic information -- or RNA -- in a sample taken from the patient.  According to Kwon, these tests may still be picking up parts of the RNA even after the person has recovered because the tests are so sensitive.  "That's one possible and very strong explanation," he said.  The same theory was posited by one of China's top respiratory experts, Zhong Nanshan. In a press conference earlier this week, he said that a recovered person can test positive because fragments of the disease remained in their body.  "I'm not too worried about this issue," he added.  What are some of the other explanations?  There are other theories for why patients may be retesting positive: there might be an error with the test, or the virus could have been reactivated.  If there's an error with the test, patients may be getting false negatives or false positives. There are a number of reasons why this could happen, including issues with the chemicals used in the test and the possibility that the virus is mutating in such a way that it is not being identified by the test.  A medical staff member in a booth takes samples from a visitor for the Covid-19 coronavirus test at a walk-thru testing station set up at Jamsil Sports Complex in Seoul on April 3, 2020.  In a public briefing, Kwon said it was unlikely testing would have errors. However, he said scientists have been screening patients who tested positive again, to make sure that their positive result wasn't just an issue with the test. "We need more further investigation," he added.  For now, the KCDC is investigating the remaining cases to get a more conclusive answer.  The changing results can be frustrating for patients. Jin Kim, who is hospitalized in the South Korean city of Daejeon, tested positive for coronavirus on March 25 -- this week he tested negative, but a day later he tested positive again. The 25-year-old will have to take another two tests at least, as he needs two consecutive negative tests to be declared recovered.  Once he's discharged from hospital, the government recommends he isolates for two weeks.  Can a person who has retested positive infect others?  Kwon says there is no evidence so far of a person who has retested positive being infectious, adding: "At the moment, we think that there is no danger of further secondary or tertiary transmission."  JUST WATCHED Inside the company that used AI to create a coronavirus test Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the company that used AI to create a coronavirus test 03:03  That's also a concern weighing on the minds of people in the US.  Responding to a question about patients retesting positive at the CNN Town Hall on Thursday night, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the jury was still out on whether a person who had recovered could still shed infectious RNA strands.  "That's a question that's still outstanding -- it hasn't been answered in the studies to date, although people are really working on that now and culturing the virus and seeing if that potential exists," she added.  After coronavirus patients are declared recovered, the KCDC recomends two more weeks of self-isolation. In an article published in BMJ medical journal this week, Sung-Il Cho, a professor of epidemiology at the Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health, also advised discharged patients to remain isolated or quarantined for a while to make sure there's no re-detection of the virus.  What does this mean for antibodies?  When a person is recovering from a virus, their body produces antibodies . Antibodies are important because they can prevent a person from being reinfected with the same virus, as the body already knows how to fight the disease.  The number of recovered patients who have retested positive for the virus has raised concerns about how antibodies work in response to Covid-19.  When asked Thursday whether it was possible for someone to get reinfected, Birx replied: "In biology, you never want to say that that's not possible."  She said they had seen coronavirus patients appear to recover and develop antibodies, but there was always the possibility of outliers who did not develop antibodies to the virus. "Those outliers always exist, but right now we don't have (any) evidence that that's a common thing that we see," she said.  The KCDC plans to test 400 specimens from people who have been infected and recovered to see how much -- if any -- immunity having Covid-19 might give people. Kwon says those tests may take several weeks.  In the end, Kwon said, it comes down to this: "We don't know much about Covid-19."
2020-04-17	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) April 15 is North Korea's most important holiday, the Day of the Sun.  It celebrates the birthday of the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung, and has in the past been marked with events like satellite launches and massive military parades . The North Korean calendar even begins on April 15 and years are measured from the date of Kim's birth.  But this year, celebrations were more subdued and appear to have come and gone without a public appearance by leader Kim Jong Un, which is unusual.  North Korean state media did not report his presence at Day of the Sun festivities on Wednesday. The country's state-run news agency, KCNA, reported that "senior officials" made the customary visit to Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum where the bodies of Kim Il Sung and his successor and son, Kim Jong Il, are both on display.  Experts are unsure of what to make of the youngest Kim's purported absence. North Korea has no free press and is often a black hole when it comes to the country's leadership. Analysts are heavily reliant on scanning state media dispatches and watching propaganda videos with Talmudic precision, reading the tea leaves for any semblance of a clue.  Read More

2020-04-17	The American Farm Bureau applauded the USDA Friday for the $19 billion in coronavirus aide that will go to America’s farmers.  “The coronavirus pandemic forced the closing of restaurants, schools and college cafeterias, causing commodity prices to fall off a cliff and serious disruptions to food supply chains. This $16 billion in aid will help keep food on Americans’ tables by providing a lifeline to farm families that were already hit by trade wars and severe weather,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau.  Farmers will receive the $16 billion in funding in the form of direct payment, while the additional $3 billion will be to use to purchase meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables.  Earlier this week, the American Farm Bureau, in partnership with Feeding America, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue proposing a USDA run voucher program that would send farm products to food banks while helping farmers and ranchers recoup costs from lost markets, such as restaurants and tourism businesses shuttered by the pandemic. It would also help get farm-fresh products quickly to families in need.  The new aide package provides about $850 million for food bank administrative costs and USDA food purchases, of which a minimum of $600 million will be designated for food purchases, according to USDA.
2020-04-18	Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images  President Donald Trump said Saturday that there "could be a difference” in how authorities enforce social distancing guidelines at mosques versus how they do at churches.  This was in a response to a question regarding a post by conservative author and political commentator Paul E. Sperry he retweeted today.  Trump said that he spoke with both imams and rabbis but claims that "politicians treat different faiths differently."  Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, called Trump’s remarks "insulting and frustrating on the eve of Ramadan … our president chooses to use his energy and platform to amplify the hateful words" of the original tweet."  "As is often the case, the President is yet again stoking anti-Muslim hate and sowing division at a time when he is failing to do his job," Khera said.  Asked if he thought mosques might not follow the social distancing guidelines, Trump responded, "I don't think that at all. I'm somebody who believes in faith. It matters not what your faith is. But politicians treat different faiths differently. I don't know what happened with our country. But the Christian faith is treated much differently than it was, and I think it's treated unfairly."  The retweet ignores the fact that President Trump is pushing for states to ease social distancing guidelines if they are ready to do so, and for weeks has been pushing for some of those restrictions to be lifted by May 1. Ramadan will be observed between April 23 and May 23 this year.
2020-04-18	A version of this story appeared in the April 18 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) There is a global expectation that life will inch back to normal if enough people develop immunity against the novel coronavirus. As scientists race to develop antibody tests, politicians have promised to reopen their economies once such testing is available.  But last night the World Health Organization poured some cold water on these hopes. It warned that there is no evidence that the presence of antibodies in blood can determine whether someone has immunity.  Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director for health emergencies at the WHO, questioned the idea that many people have already developed immunity. "There's been an expectation, maybe, that herd immunity may have been achieved and that the majority of people in society may already have developed antibodies," he said. "I think the general evidence is pointing against that .... so it may not solve the problem the governments are trying to solve."  There are plenty of worrying signs. In South Korea, 163 people who recovered from coronavirus have retested positive. China has experienced similar episodes, Paula Hancocks, Yoonjung Seo and Julia Hollingsworth report  Scientists hope there are other explanations for this phenomenon -- that perhaps tests are picking up remnants of the virus or generating false positives. And while they underline that no evidence exists that a person who has retested positive can spread the virus further, there haven't been any conclusive studies to rule it out.

2020-04-19	Three sources involved in the negotiations said that the details over how to spend billions over testing for Covid-19 remains unresolved in the talks over the massive relief bill under negotiation by top congressional leaders and the White House.  The measure will include hundreds of billions of dollars for the new small business loan program, Payroll Protection Program.  Democrats and Republicans have different visions over a testing policy, one of the sources said.  President Trump has increasingly said that testing needs to be done by the states, while Democrats have called for a testing program led by the federal government.  As part of the deal to replenish the small business loan program, the two sides had agreed to $25 billion for testing.  But the details are more complicated to sort out.  It appears increasingly likely that talks will extend into tomorrow, but they are still negotiating tonight, the sources said.
2020-04-20	(CNN) As most Americans were preparing for their sixth week of staying at home and social distancing, President Donald Trump appeared at the White House Sunday night for one of his now-trademark coronavirus press briefings.  It was a mix of score-settling, blame-shifting and reporter-bullying. I've chronicled the lines you need to see from it below.  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  1."A great work has been going on and we could have an answer tomorrow and we're going to see what -- what exactly does take place."  Trump is talking about a deal to fund the Paycheck Protection Program -- I think. And away we go!  2. "And we'll see how that all comes out but a lot of good things are happening."  Uh, OK.  3. "And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people. So we've -- we've done more testing than all of these countries combined, France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria and Australia, Sweden and Canada. That's something, right?"  4. "We're going to -- that's something -- somebody said to me, President, you look tired. I said, I should be tired."  Tired because he is working so hard. Get it?  5. "Is it -- does it remind you of something? Reminds you of this. Right? Ones a swab, ones a Q-tip. It's actually different. It's very sophisticated actually but it's a little bit like -- so this is the swab and we've ordered a lot of them."  In which the President of the United State expertly breaks down the difference between a Q-tip and a coronavirus testing swab.  6. "Nobody's close to us. No country is close to us."  We are the best. By a lot. On what? Well, coronavirus, I think? (Trump's right about one thing: The United States does have more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country in the world.  7. "The Wall Street Journal wrote a fantastic piece, a highly respected gentleman, Christopher DeMuth. This piece was just in the Wall Street Journal, weekend edition and 'Trump rewrites the book on emergencies.'"  Trump proceeded to read a lengthy excerpt from the op-ed -- all of it praising him and how great a job he has done. (The thrust of the piece focused on how Trump has resisted the urge to grow the federal government's role amid the crisis -- an argument undermined somewhat by the trillions of dollars Congress is pouring into the economy to keep it afloat.)  8. "It was hard to get it aroused and it is hard to get it aroused but we got it aroused."  [narrator voice] He's talking about the "American way."  9. "To see this was a very nice feeling, not for me necessarily but for all of the people that have worked with us."  Oh, so the op-ed that praised Trump that he read to the press corps wasn't really about him. Yeah, that makes sense.  10. "I want to thank the writer Christopher for this article and it was a great article."  Always remember that what Trump means when he says an article was "great" or "good" is that it was nice to him. That's it. He has no objective standard.  11. "Ventilators are a big deal and we are now the king of ventilators. We have so many ventilators."  The king of ventilators. Believe me.  12. "Many governors are doing this incredible work and they're working with us very closely on testing and working in their states. And again it should be a local thing because it's point, it's all these points within a state but we're helping them a lot and we want to help them a lot."  In which Trump foists the blame for ongoing testing availability to governors and states.  13. "Some people believe in it like they can't exist without testing and other people don't believe in it nearly as much."  This pretty much sums things up!  14. "You must remember that the governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states but now they want to have us, the federal government do the testing and again testing is -- is local."  "The authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be." -- Donald Trump, on presidential authority to reopen states, on April 13 . (Which was one week ago.)  15. "You can't have it both ways."  Please see No. 14.  16. "But we'll be doing testing at a level -- already we're doing testing at a level nobody's ever done before but we'll be doing testing at a level that the biggest tester in the world will be very happy very soon."  The most testing. Beautiful testing. Many people are saying it.  17. "You know, you see people picketing a little bit, and they want to get out. They want to get out and get back with their lives, and that's good."  18. "Well, they're -- the lines that you're -- we're famous for now, some are flat and some are up."  The "lines" Trump is touting here are the projection lines about coronavirus cases -- and deaths. Apparently, "we" are also "famous" for these "lines" now.  19. "It's not the same thing as a flu at all."  "This is a flu. This is like a flu." -- Donald Trump, February 26.  20. "It's even a much different death, to be honest -- much different death. This is violent."  "Dr." Trump on the relative violence of dying from the flu vs. dying from coronavirus.  21. "I want to thank Governor Cuomo, a relationship there, for this whole thing."  "Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining'. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking!" -- Donald Trump, three days ago  22. "Frankly, the governor of Michigan was good with us on -- on beds."  23. "You know, it's a very complex subject. You need buildings or you have to do tents or you have to do a lot of different things, a lot of different ways."  "This is a very complicated case, Maude. You know, a lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-you's. And, uh, lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's head." -- The Dude  24. "They were fantastic -- Florida, likewise, Governor DeSantis."  25. "We do have a clip that I thought would be appropriate to put up today. It will take two minutes. And I think you'll find it interesting."  The clip Trump played was -- wait for it -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) praising him. This is my surprised face.  26. "They left out the good part. Great -- great job, fellas."  In which the President says the clip of people praising him wasn't laudatory enough. Very normal stuff! By the book!  27. "You know, this is not about Democrats, Republicans."  "Nervous Nancy is an inherently 'dumb' person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as 'Speaker'. Wallace & @FoxNews are on a bad path, watch!" -- Trump on Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 12:58 p.m. Sunday  28. "It's -- actually, The Wall Street Journal -- Christopher was saying I want to make people feel good, too. I want to make -- when they're doing a good job, I want to make people feel good."  Offered without comment.  29. "It was all -- it was Andrew this morning. It's -- it's a little longer clip than that. But you'll see, it was really a very nice thing that he said."  Yes, Trump is still trying to get his staff to find the other nice thing Andrew Cuomo said about him so he can play it for reporters.  30. "Some are older geniuses, but mostly younger geniuses, I think I can say."  Team Older Genius right here  31. "This is not a good thing that happened. It came out of China. So we're not -- we're not in a position where we're going to say much yet."  Trump is hinting here at the idea that the coronavirus was created in a lab in Wuhan. The US government is reportedly looking into that possibility but officials have cautioned it's too early to draw any hard-and-fast conclusions.  32. "So nobody ever thought this could have happened, a thing like this."  33. "I mean, they feel -- I watched the protest and they were all six feet apart. I mean, it was a very orderly group of people."  34. "I believe the term the governor used was phenomenal. We've done a phenomenal job. That was the term that -- that was the only sentence they left out which is OK. But I -- I appreciate that's what Governor Cuomo said."  He's still on the part of Cuomo's comments that didn't play in his highlight reel!  35. "I see protesters for all sorts of things. And I'm with everybody. I'm with everybody."  [nods head very, very slowly]  36. "That's a mosquito. I don't like mosquitoes. I don't like mosquitoes at all."  This isn't a metaphor. It was an actual mosquito. And Trump swatted at it  37. "No, no, we're going to be safe. We have to be safe. We don't want to close anything. We're not going to be closing. But we're going to be doing it beautifully, systematically."  38. "And I think they have the rest of that clip. I just thought it was a very good clip. I think it's a tribute to New York. I think it's a tribute to the federal government. And I thought it was nice."  THEY FOUND THE CLIP. And then Trump played it. And it was Cuomo praising him. The end.  39. "Nice and easy, nice and easy, just relax."  In which the president of the United States tells a female reporter -- Weijia Jiang of CBS News -- to "just relax" because she is asking him a tough question. Literally beyond belief.  40. "Keep your voice down, please. Keep your voice down."  Again this is Trump talking to Jiang. And, yes, he really told a female reporter to be "nice and easy," to "just relax" and to "keep your voice down."  41. "We're in great shape. It's so easy to get. Reagents and swabs are so easy to get."  42. "What I'm doing is I'm standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job. Not for me, for the men and women."  The clips Trump played in the briefing were specifically praising him -- and his administration.  43. "They were excoriated by people like you that don't know any better because you don't have the brains you were born with. You should be praising people that have done a good job, not doing what you do."  Putting aside all the rest of what Trump said, what does "you don't have the brains you were born with" actually mean? It's that, like, even possible?  44. "It's not about me. Nothing is about me."  [narrator voice] It's always about him.  45. "I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for a president. They did say Abraham Lincoln had bad treatment, too."  OK, so, presidents with worst press treatment -- a brief list: 1) Donald J. Trump 2) Abraham Lincoln. That's it. That's the list.  46. "I've seen the people -- I've seen the interviews of people. These are great people."  47. "You'll find out what I'm going to do. I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but I will tell you, the whole thing turned out to be a scam and it turned to be a disgrace to our country. And it was a takedown of a duly elected president."  The question Trump was asked was whether he was planning to pardon Paul Manafort or Roger Stone. And who could know what way he is leaning after such a politic answer as this one????  48. "You know what they are, though? They're scum. They're human scum."  The President of the United States on FBI officials who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Very normal!  49. "We inherited a lot of garbage. We took -- they had tests that were no good. They had -- all the stuff was no good. It came from somewhere, so whoever -- whoever came up with it."  50. "And we even have Space Force. Mike and I were talking about what an achievement that is. First time in 72 years, we have a new force."  51. "That's why your ratings are so bad, because you're pathetic. Go ahead, let's go. Your ratings are terrible. You got to get back to real news. Go ahead."  52. "I'm not a fan of Mitt Romney. I don't really want his advice."
2020-04-20	New York/Hong Kong (CNN Business) Oil prices are still crashing after a stunning collapse Monday that saw US crude futures plunge below zero for the first time in history.  The pain in oil markets is carrying over to stocks, with Asian and European indexes, and US stock futures, all in the red on Tuesday.  US oil futures for May delivery were last trading below $0 again after briefly popping above $1 a barrel. The May contract, which expires Tuesday, finished regular trading Monday at -$37.63 a barrel.  The West Texas Intermediate June contract, which is now being traded more actively, crashed more than 11% to $18.14 a barrel. Brent, the global benchmark, also plummeted nearly 22%, last trading at $19.92 a barrel.  The coronavirus pandemic has caused oil demand to evaporate so rapidly that the world is running out of room to store barrels that nobody wants. A new agreement a little over a week ago by Saudi Arabia and Russia — with other producers — to cut supply by a record amount has failed to convince traders that the supply glut will ease any time soon.

2020-04-20	(CNN) When Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland addressed the media at his Monday afternoon news conference, he made it clear his wife, Yumi Hogan -- and not the federal government -- was the reason his state secured half a million coronavirus test kits.  Maryland's first lady was born in South Korea and became a US citizen in 1994. She not only used her native language to help secure the tests but also helped negotiate the deal.  "We convened countless calls, nearly every night, sometimes it seemed like all night," said Hogan of the 22 days he and the first lady worked in conjunction with the Korean government to land the mother lode of hard-to-come-by coronavirus test kits.  On Saturday, both Hogans were on the tarmac at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, greeting a chartered 777 Korean Air plane with no passengers aboard. Inside were enough test kits from Korea's LabGenomics for Maryland to perform 500,000 tests.  "The administration made it clear over and over again they want the states to take the lead, and we have to go out and do it ourselves, and that's exactly what we did," said Hogan on Monday, his wife in a pink coat, silk scarf tied around her shoulders and a blue face mask, standing to the side of the podium.
2020-04-20	(CNN) Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.  Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.  Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.  1. Shortness of breath  Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.  "If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.  "If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added.  The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen.  Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.  2. Fever  Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.  CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.  "I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.  Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).  "There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.  "We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."  Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.  "Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained.  "One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever."  3. Dry Cough  Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.  "It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained.  The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.  "It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added.  report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.  4. Chills and body aches  "The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.  'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.  "I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said.  Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.  One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.  5. Sudden confusion  Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.  6. Digestive issues  At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.  "In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.  Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.  The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.  7. Pink eye  Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.  Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.  But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.  Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.  8. Loss of smell and taste  In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.  "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.  "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones."  "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.  A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.  Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.  9. Fatigue  For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.  Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.  "I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360 . "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours."  Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.  10. Headache, sore throat, congestion  The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.  Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.  Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.  So what should you do?  "At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.

That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.  It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.  In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.  "Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises.  To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.  "People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said.  A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.  How to be evaluated  If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.  "We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue," Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. "However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated."  If you do have those three signs, where should you go?  "If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients," Harris said.  "If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers," Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.  "If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly," Schaffer said. "It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do."
2020-04-20	President Trump and senior members of his administration suggested during Monday’s White House briefing that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan did not need to secure coronavirus tests from South Korea.  Hogan, a Republican, has been pressing the federal government for more coronavirus testing capacity, and announced that the tests had been secured from South Korea earlier Monday.  Admiral Brett Giroir told reporters during the briefing, “I don’t know what the governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea, but there is excess capacity every day. If he wanted to send 30 or 40,000 tests to LabCorp and Quest, that could be done. That could be done tomorrow.”  Vice President Mike Pence said he would follow up with Hogan’s office. He also pointed to a slide that showed testing facilities “just in the state of Maryland.”  “I don’t know when the governor placed the order from South Korea. I wouldn’t begrudge him or his health officials for ordering tests. But the capacity for all the different laboratories and number of machines across Maryland is part of what we were communicating today,” Pence said, adding that governors were assured access to federal testing facilities.  The President was more pointed in his response to Hogan’s decision to get tests from South Korea, saying, “Take a look at that map. The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, could have saved a lot of money.”  “I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge would’ve been helpful,” he added.  Following the President's comments, Hogan's spokesperson tweeted a copy of a letter from Hogan, Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam that "specifically asked for a federal testing site in the region."  Hogan announced Monday that Maryland took delivery of 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea in a deal brokered with help from his South Korean born wife, Yumi.  A Boeing 777 landed at BWI on Saturday, part of what Hogan dubbed “Operation Enduring Friendship.” The coronavirus kits come from LabGenomics and Hogan says the half million kits are “equal to the total amount of testing which has been completed by four of the top five states in America combined.”  “I want to sincerely thanks our Korean partners for assisting us in this fight against our common hidden enemy,” Hogan said.  “The state of Maryland owes an incredible debt of gratitude to the people of South Korea,” he added.
2020-04-20	(CNN) What will it take, realistically, to re-open the country? Will we be able to return to normal in the near future? CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta speaks with former CDC Director, Dr. Tom Frieden about "boxing in" Covid-19.  You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.  Listener voice memo: Hi Dr. Gupta, there have been somewhat mixed signals on the process of reopening the country. I know there needs to be a wide emphasis on testing when that happens. But can you walk us through what the process should look like?  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Last week, the White House coronavirus task force announced new guidelines for opening up the country.  The plan is to do it in three phases that would gradually lift restrictions on businesses.  In the first phase, places like gyms, movie theaters, and restaurants will be allowed to reopen, as long as they follow strict social distancing protocols.  The second would allow schools and bars to reopen with reduced occupancy. And people can start taking trips for nonessential travel.  And in the final stage, vulnerable individuals no longer would have to stay home, as long as they continue social distancing measures. And employers could allow employees to return to work. That might involve regular testing and daily screening.  These guidelines are just that -- they lay out a path to getting back to normal life. But exactly when and how states decide to follow them is up to state and local officials. So where do we go from here? And when and how will we know the time is right?  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, and this is "Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."  Dr. Gupta: First, let's take a look at what some other countries have already done -- and what that might mean for us here in the US.  We spoke to an English teacher in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have started.  Doug Perez: My name is Doug Perez. Obviously, I've lived in Wuhan through the outbreak. I live here with my dog and my girlfriend.  Dr. Gupta: Since January, people like Doug have been in lockdown; some residents haven't been allowed to leave their homes or gated communities for months.  Perez: It got so bad that, you know, at some point during the lockdown, my girlfriend, she needed some medicine for something unrelated to the coronavirus. The community wasn't letting us out for anything. So, you know, I've had to climb over a fence and literally go to the pharmacy.  Dr. Gupta: After 76 days -- on April 8th -- the lockdown was lifted in Wuhan and people can now leave their neighborhoods.  Perez: People are out and about. You're even starting to see some families. Everyone's wearing masks. There are a lot of people out. There's even traffic. Now things are really returning to normal.  Dr. Gupta: To be clear, Chinese officials have warned that they still have to be cautious and control measures will To be clear, Chinese officials have warned that they still have to be cautious and control measures will remain in place  But how will we in the United States get back to normal, or at least closer to it?  I asked someone who's no stranger to epidemics: Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Frieden ran the CDC during the Ebola crisis in 2014.  Now, he's the president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit initiative that aims to make the world safer from epidemics.  Last week, his nonprofit released a plan for reopening society called "Box It In." It outlines four steps for containing the virus: testing, isolating, contact tracing and quarantining. I asked Dr. Frieden to explain his plan.  Dr. Tom Frieden (President and CEO, Resolve to Save Lives): So let's take each of the four corners of that box for testing. Your local government. Your state government is going to tell you who's priority for testing. And we want to make sure that people with symptoms of Covid get tested. We want to make sure that especially health care workers with symptoms of Covid get tested. Anyone who is in a nursing home or homeless shelter or prison get tested. But if you are infected, you have to isolate yourself and really isolate yourself, because you could spread it to someone who could die from it.  On the contact tracing. If you're a case, you need to figure out from 48 hours before your first symptom until you isolated yourself completely. Who is everyone you might have exposed? And get all of those people's information down and either let them know yourself or work through the local health department to inform them. And then if you're one of those people who's been exposed, you need to quarantine yourself. You need to be not going out because you could feel fine, but in that first day or two of illness be highly infectious. That means you need to stay home. If we do those four things well, we can reduce the spread and make each successive wave smaller, to put Covid in a smaller and smaller box so we can go out to more places more safely.  Dr. Gupta: When you think about the box that way, these four pressures that you're putting on the virus. How hard is this?  Dr. Frieden: It's extraordinarily difficult. This is a highly infectious virus. There is spread from people before they have symptoms. There is some spread from people who will never have symptoms. And the challenge is to target our testing well so we find cases promptly. And find contacts. Contact tracing is a tried and true public health method.  Dr. Gupta: You have said based, I think, on some of the modeling data out of Wuhan, that in order to contact trace appropriately and have enough people to do it, you're talking hundreds of thousands of people potentially. It's like a new industry. Is this a challenge we can overcome? Can we actually get to the point where we can box in the virus the way that you're describing it?  Dr. Frieden: Our lives and our economy depend on it. What we have to do is fairly clear. We know what to do. But doing it quickly and at scale, that's the challenge. And doing that means really revolutionizing our public health system, which has been underinvested in. In this case, we're going to have to really ramp up our ability to test, trace, to isolate, to quarantine and look at the best practices from all over the world. These are not easy things to do, but they are essential things to do.  Dr. Gupta: It all seems to come back to testing. The numbers of tests have gone up. But I still get calls. I don't know if you do. Dr. Frieden, even a couple of calls I've gotten from health care folks around the country, that told me they still had a hard time getting tests themselves as health care workers who were making rounds in the hospital. Where do we stand with testing and is it someone's responsibility? I know you don't want to get into the politics of this -- but whose responsible?  Dr. Frieden: It is absolutely the federal government's responsibility. Currently, we're doing in this country less than 150,000 tests a day. We released a report and we calculated quite simply, if we were just testing the highest priority people and nobody else, we'd need about three times as many tests. And if we tried to test really extensively, it would be 10, 20 times that. Now, it's not going to be possible to test everybody we'd like to test anytime soon, but that doesn't mean it's hopeless.  Dr. Gupta: Listening to what you're saying, it does seem like short of a vaccine, we are going to be at this for a while. Should we do all these things but really anticipate mostly staying at home until a vaccine comes out?  Dr. Frieden: This is a long war. We're not going to have a vaccine anytime soon unless something very unexpected happens. We have to get used to a new normal. In this new normal, we're not going to shake hands. We're not going to go out if we're sick. We're going to figure out a way to cover our mouth and nose. We're going to be teleworking more, even when things open up. We're going to be sheltering and shielding those who have underlying health conditions and the elderly. But if we take it one step at a time and loosen the faucet gradually, we can get back to this new normal.  Dr. Gupta: Is there a country around the world that you've been watching that they have done it right in terms of early testing, isolation, tracing and now being very deliberate and thoughtful about reopening?  Dr. Frieden: There are countries around the world that are in this process. It's still early days. Iceland, Germany, South Korea, Singapore have all taken really thoughtful approaches and they've been able to keep the virus to lower levels than other countries. We also really do need to learn from China. China has been battling this virus longer than any other country. They're using extraordinary measures. They've traced more than 720,000 people. They have internal quarantines. So, if you travel from one part of the country to another, you've got to quarantine for 14 days. They're doing millions of tests and they're finding thousands of asymptomatically infected people. They're isolating those people. They're quarantining people's contacts. It's an extraordinary effort. I don't know if other countries are going to be able to replicate that, but we can certainly adapt it and learn from it.  Dr. Gupta: I'm not a Pollyannaish, sort of person, I am an optimistic person. Is there anything good that's come out of all this?  Dr. Frieden: I hope that coming out of this we'll recognize that there are thousands of life-threatening gaps in our ability to find, stop and prevent infectious diseases, and that we as a world will make a commitment to holding ourselves accountable for closing those gaps. It is absolutely inevitable that there will be another epidemic, another pandemic in the future. What's not inevitable is that we will continue to be so underprepared.  Dr. Gupta: Reopening isn't going to happen overnight. We all have to do our part to practice physical distancing and listen to our local officials. We also have to remember that the information and recommendations may change. After all we are dealing with a novel or new coronavirus, something human beings have never seen before.

2020-04-20	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sought to turn criticism about federal coronavirus testing availability back on governors Monday evening, claiming some didn't "understand" what they were being told by administration officials and assuring that there was plenty of capacity ready to be used.  The move came after Vice President Mike Pence led a multi-hour call with the governors earlier in the day to address the building frustration over the availability of testing kits and processing capacity. On the call, Pence outlined testing capacity and provided each state's governor with a list of names, addresses and phone numbers of labs with additional testing capacity.  Where Pence sought to reassure, Trump once again sought to deflect blame.  During his daily press briefing, the President took swipes at two governors -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat.  He said Pritzker "did not understand his capacity (to test), not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support."  Trump also said Hogan "didn't understand too much about what was going on," later asserting that the governor did not need to secure coronavirus tests from South Korea. Hogan had touted the 500,000 tests he succeeded in procuring in part thanks to his wife's South Korean roots at his own news conference earlier Monday.  But Trump told reporters: "The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, could have saved a lot of money ... I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge would've been helpful."  Hogan responded to Trump's Monday evening comment, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room": "I'm not sure what the President is referring to. I have a pretty good understanding of what's going on and I appreciated the information that was provided by his team."  "I don't want to get into criticizing back and forth, Wolf. The President was not on the call," Hogan added.  Trump did praise Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo regarding New York's testing capacity during the press briefing, noting that Cuomo will be traveling to Washington on Tuesday for an Oval Office meeting.  Pence's call  The vice president's call with the country's governors , included several officials on the White House coronavirus task forces and focused testing, according to multiple sources familiar with the call. One state official said it was the first time the testing issue had been laid out in such detail from a top official. The state official said the administration's message was that they were working to get the states what they need -- and that "it's a partnership" between the federal and state governments.  At the same time, Trump , who was not on the call, insisted that the responsibility for coronavirus testing belonged primarily to the states.  "Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, 'Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.' They screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the State's task. But everyone got their V's, with many to spare. Now they scream (...) 'Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game," Trump tweeted while the call was happening.  Maryland's Hogan had said Sunday that a lack of testing is the No. 1 problem in America and "has been since the beginning of the crisis."  "The administration, I think, is trying to ramp up testing. They are doing some things with respect to private labs," Hogan said on CNN's "State of the Union." "But to try and push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing -- somehow we aren't doing our job -- is just absolutely false."  According to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, the challenge many state leaders on the call expressed was getting "increased testing capacity." Pennsylvania needs the reagents and test kits, and requests for similar testing supplies, he said, was the "general cry" from the other governors.  "We all expressed that hope today that we could move toward that and the vice president assured us that the federal government was moving as quickly as possible toward that end," he added.  Pence said Monday's call with governors was "very productive."  "We heard again, not only the fact that we are making progress in slowing the spread. We're seeing very encouraging signs even in hotspots around the country their cases are leveling and in some cases going down," Pence said Monday afternoon at FEMA Headquarters following the call.  Questions remain  Though the call was not described by sources as contentious, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer , a Democrat, did bring up recent protests in her state and asked for a stronger response from the federal government.  According to Whitmer's office, she "called on the federal government to reiterate the need to stay home after a growing number of protests in states with Republican and Democratic governors threatened to spread the virus even further."  Governors have been pleading for federal testing help for more than a month, as a shortage of testing supplies and a backlog in private labs made it nearly impossible for the states to reach the level of testing needed to reduce social distancing guidelines. Last week, Trump grew frustrated after a slew of phone calls on reopening the economy grew repetitive, with business leaders, governors and lawmakers all stressing the need for more testing to reopen the economy.  This week, White House aides, under the direction of the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are trying to determine the best way to deal with the testing supply chain to get the needed elements to the states, according to a source familiar with the issue.  One hurdle has been figuring out how to accelerate the production of the testing supplies. The administration recently said it would employ the Defense Production Act to provide federal funding to a company to produce more testing swabs. But accelerating production for the reagents used for tests may pose a new challenge, given that they're often manufactured overseas and are therefore not subject to the act.  While the President attempted to paint states' requests for help with testing as a partisan issue, it hasn't just been Democrats who have asked for federal assistance with testing. Governors on both sides of the aisle have said that without greater testing capabilities, businesses in their states will not be able to reopen.  In addition to Maryland's Hogan, GOP Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, also underscored the importance of increased coronavirus testing, tweeting after Monday's call: "This morning, I spoke with @VP and our nation's governors regarding expanded testing capacity & Tennessee's aggressive push to test outside of traditional COVID-19 symptoms. Ramping up our testing & health care capacity is a critical step to get Tennesseans back to work safely."  This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.
2020-04-20	(CNN) Individual missteps compounded upon each other when it mattered most put the United States well behind on Covid-19 testing. They included genuine fumbles, an overly restrictive testing policy and overly optimistic assurances.  But now that it seems, hopefully, that the US may be getting the rate of Covid-19 infections under control, the lack of available testing seems likely to delay when the US can get back open for business. Trump preaches from the White House about the sheer number of tests conducted, but it's the wrong metric in a country the size of the US, where more than 41,000 people have died so far.  The countries that are ever so slowly climbing their way past coronavirus share one key trait: widespread testing. Read this about Germany . Or watch this about Italy.  Germany, with a smaller population, is testing 120,000 per day, according to The New York Times. Harvard researchers have argued that unless the US could be testing 500,000 per day by May 1 , the economy won't be able to open up.  Until the US has that and until it's possible to figure out where the virus is and where it is going, who has had it and whether the larger herd of Americans might be gaining some immunity, reopening the the country still seems a long way off.  Or maybe not. Georgia will partially reopen -- Gov. Brian Kemp is Gov. Brian Kemp is moving to open some businesses -- gyms, hair salons, body art studios -- as soon as this week, with restaurants and theaters set to follow April 27. Bars and nightclubs will stay closed. Cities cannot supersede Kemp's order, which will be implemented statewide and follows similar announcements in South Carolina and Tennessee after President Donald Trump told governors to call their own shots.  Figure it out -- Other governors are fuming at the Trump administration, which has essentially cut states loose to figure it out on their own.  Why did this happen?  A remarkable new report from CNN's Sara Murray, Nick Valencia, Jeremy Diamond and Scott Glover documents what we know about what went wrong in the early days of the outbreak.  They write: "The Trump administration's failure to quickly scale up testing would continue to cripple the US response to the pandemic for months. Even now -- three months after the first detected case of the coronavirus in the US -- testing remains a key challenge to President Donald Trump's push to reopen the economy."  A flawed test wasted critical time and resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shipped tests February 6 and by February 10 it became clear they weren't working.  Back then, tests had to be sent back to CDC to be processed, a three- to four-day process.  A dismissive President failed to focus attention. Rather than fix the brewing problem, Trump downplayed it. There was no push from the White House for more testing.  It wasn't until February 23 that the CEO of American Public Health Laboratories asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow the company to create and implement its own tests.  Meanwhile, the CDC director told Congress of efforts to remanufacture tests.  The FDA still had not determined why the tests -- which were developed in a lab and not a manufacturing facility -- were malfunctioning.  On February 29, the FDA changed regulations to allow additional labs to develop tests, although the agency says regulations have not been a roadblock to testing.  It's nearly impossible to get a solid sense of the problem. Today the White House announced it Today the White House announced it would again invoke the Defense Production Act to speed up production of nasal swabs necessary for tests. Trump's economic adviser clarified that means federal funding would go to Puritan Medical Supplies.  The buck stops anywhere but here  Trump, who seems further and further afield from his own government's response effort, skipped a call with governors but tweeted while it was going on, irked by the frustration with him even though his promises that testing would be available have not come to be.  "Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, 'Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.' They screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the State's task. But everyone got their V's, with many to spare. Now they scream (...) 'Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game," Trump tweeted while the call was happening.  Read this, from CNN's Mike Warren and many others, about the protests against state governments Trump appears to be pushing, regardless of his own federal guidelines.  This is not political -- We simply don't know how widespread the infections are.  Research released Monday by the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health estimates that approximately 221,000 to 442,000 adult residents in L.A. County have had the infection, which is 28 to 55 times greater than the 7,994 cases that were reported to the county at the time of the study in early April.
2020-04-20	One crew member of the Italian cruise ship Costa Atranchica has tested positive for coronavirus, the mayor of Nagasaki, Tomihisa Tagami, said at a news conference on Monday.  The Costa Atranchica cruise ship, which is anchored at Nagasaki Port, has a total of 623 crew members who are foreign nationals. All crew members are now onboard the ship.  Health checks will be carried out on at least 53 people who may have had close contact with the crew member who tested positive, according to Tagami.  On March 13, Nagasaki Gov. Hoso Nakamura said the government requested that the crew refrain from disembarkation due to the spread of infection in Japan.  Local authorities did not provide any details on the crew members and their nationalities.
2020-04-20	(CNN) The US is monitoring intelligence that suggests North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un , is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery, according to a US official with direct knowledge.  A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim's health.  Kim recently missed the celebration of his grandfather's birthday on April 15, which raised speculation about his well-being. He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.  Another US official told CNN Monday that the concerns about Kim's health are credible but the severity is hard to assess.  National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said the US is "keeping a close eye" on reports about Kim's health.  "We're monitoring these reports very closely," O'Brien said during an interview with Fox News Tuesday. "As you know, North Korea is a very closed society," he said.  Later on Tuesday, a US defense official said that the US military assessment is that while they are examining reports regarding Kim's poor health, the evidence at this point does not suggest he is incapacitated.  Daily NK, an online newspaper based in South Korea that focuses on North Korea, reports that Kim reportedly received a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12.  Kim received the cardiovascular system procedure because of "excessive smoking, obesity, and overwork," according to the news site, and is now receiving treatment in a villa in Hyangsan County following his procedure.  After assessing that Kim's condition had improved, most of the medical team treating him returned to Pyongyang on April 19 and only part of them remained to oversee his recovery situation, according to the news site. CNN is unable to independently confirm the report.  A South Korean source told CNN Monday that the country's top leaders are very much aware of reports about Kim's health status but cannot independently verify details published by Daily NK. The source acknowledged that Kim's issues related to weight and smoking are well known but made clear they are waiting for more information.  South Korea's Presidential Blue House said in a statement provided to reporters that they have nothing to confirm on reports about Kim's health and that "no unusual signs" have been detected inside North Korea.  South Korea's Unification Ministry and Defense Ministry have given a "no comment."  The National Security Council and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday. CNN has also reached out to the CIA and the State Department for comment.  In the meantime, US officials have been reaching out to North Korean experts -- particularly those who have studied the Kim regime -- to talk about contingency planning, a third source familiar with the communications told CNN.  Still, the situation remains murky as gathering intelligence out of North Korea is notoriously difficult -- one of the most challenging targets for US intelligence.  North Korea tightly controls any information surrounding its leader, who is treated almost like a deity within the country. His absences from official state media often spark speculation and rumors about his health. North Korea has no free press and is often a black hole when it comes to the country's leadership. Analysts are heavily reliant on scanning state media dispatches and watching propaganda videos for any semblance of a clue.  Kim last appeared in North Korean state media on April 11. April 15 -- North Korea's most important holiday, the anniversary of the birth of the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung -- came and went without any official mention of Kim Jong Un's movements.  Experts are unsure of what to make of Kim's absence from any festivities celebrating his grandfather. When North Korean leaders have not shown up to these important celebrations in the past, it has portended major developments. But it has also turned out to be nothing.  "There have been a number of recent rumors about Kim's health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn't present on the important April 15th celebrations," said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea. "But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumors about Kim Jong-un or his father. We'll have to wait and see."  Kim Jong Il's absence from a parade celebrating North Korea's 60th anniversary in 2008 was followed by rumblings that he was in poor health. It was later revealed he had a stroke, after which his health continued to decline until his death in 2011.  Kim Jong Un disappeared from the public eye for more than a month in 2014, which also prompted speculation about his health. He returned sporting a cane, and days later South Korean intelligence said that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.  "It's easy to be wrong on this one," said John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.  Still, with concerns about Kim's health mounting, the state of US-South Korean relations has US officials worried, sources tell CNN.  On Monday, President Donald Trump said the two countries have a "great relationship," but added he wants them to pay more for the US presence in the country. The two countries have missed multiple deadlines for those negotiations. And now in-person negotiations are hindered because of the coronavirus pandemic.  This breaking story has been updated with additional reporting.
2020-04-21	Dr. Alain B. Labrique is an infectious disease epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  The recent announcement that Google and Apple are jointly developing an app that could alert you if you have been in contact with someone infected with coronavirus is a prime example of the tensions involved in using digital tools to fight this pandemic. The voluntary participation that is a cornerstone of the companies' privacy policy means the app may struggle to get a sufficient user base and, as a result, may not have much of an impact.  But it's urgent that we find a way to strike a balance when it comes to using digital technologies to manage this threat to our health and economy. The United States is moving toward an inflection point in the pandemic where we need a realistic road map for getting America back on its feet without sparking a second surge in infections. The data generated by mobile phones can play an incredibly valuable role by providing insights that can allow public health and economic imperatives to work in sync, rather than in opposition to one another.  Countries like Israel, Thailand and Hong Kong already are effectively using data generated by smartphones to fight COVID-19. In Singapore, the government released an app that uses Bluetooth to identify people who have been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. South Korea has used cell phone data to create maps showing where infected people went even before they were diagnosed. The public health implications of such data insights are remarkable.  But significant privacy concerns have accompanied these moves to compile medical and location data. They are likely to be especially prominent around any effort to use digital tools to fight the pandemic in the United States. We're a country that has long emphasized the importance of autonomy and individual freedom. There has always been a tension between civil liberties and public health interventions, especially during crises when the suspension of freedoms is for the greater good.  Here are a few ways we can take advantage of digital technologies while balancing public health imperatives with privacy concerns.  Read More
2020-04-21	As several states make plans for reopening their communities during the coronavirus pandemic, a group of top public health experts cautioned Tuesday against reopening society before testing capacity expands significantly.  Different parts of the country are in different stages of the epidemic with New York well into the first wave and other places just beginning to see the impact of the disease. This matters, said Dr. Caroline Buckee, Harvard associate professor of epidemiology and the associate director of the university’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.  Knowing the location of the virus is key to relaxing social distancing and returning to normalcy, Buckee told a symposium sponsored by Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the New England Journal of Medicine.  The lack of testing capacity is a big problem because the disease has “a very broad clinical spread,” Buckee said. So even when people show up at the hospital and get tested there are many more cases in the community, including mild and asymptomatic cases. “And those are the people that are spreading the disease,” she said.  It’s important to learn whether people who have recovered can still spread the disease, noted NEJM editor Dr. Eric Rubin.  “What we really need is some epidemiological data to tell us, 'Are people who have left the hospital going on to transmit the disease?'” Rubin said. “That’s kind of the shoe leather epidemiology, contact tracing, following what happens to the context of those patients, which takes some manpower.  Buckee added that without knowing the answers, the nation could reopen too soon and risk a deadly second pandemic wave.  “Right now, we don’t have good estimates for where we are on the epidemic curve in different places. So, discussions of relaxation of physical distance, which do seem to be having an effect, curbing some of the worst impacts of the outbreak, need to be based on the capacity to test people so we know where we are,” she said.
2020-04-21	The new coronavirus lingers for as long as three weeks in the bodies of patients with severe disease, Chinese researchers reported Tuesday.  The virus can be found deep in the lungs and in the stool of patients, and the sicker they are, the longer it stays, the team at a hospital in China’s Zhejiang province reported. But the virus was found in the urine of patients less than half the time, and rarely in the blood at first.  Their report provides another piece of evidence about the pattern of disease in Covid-19 patients. It published in the BMJ. Unlike many recently released studies about the coronavirus, this one has gone through peer review, which means other experts have reviewed the findings.  The team tested 96 patients treated in their hospital for Covid-19 between January and March. They tested samples from the nose and throat, from deeper in the respiratory system, in the blood, stool and urine. They wanted to see how long people had virus in their systems and whether it was likely to spread in various ways. The findings support other studies showing that the virus could spread in stool from infected people.  In general, the sicker people were, the longer the virus could be detected. That could be important for doctors to know, so they can predict which patients will fare better, and, perhaps, how long they may remain infectious to others.��  “The median duration of virus in respiratory samples was 18 days,” they wrote.  More on this: An earlier Chinese study showed that people without symptoms had just as much virus in their noses as people who had Covid-19 symptoms – something that indicated people who are not sick could be just as likely to spread virus as people who are.  The team in Zhejiang found that sicker people had more virus deeper in their respiratory tracts, however.  They also found differences between men and women with Covid-19. “In this study, we found that the duration of virus was significantly longer in men than in women,” they wrote.  “Our results shed light on the causes of disease severity in men in terms of the duration of the virus. In addition to differences in immune status between men and women, it has also been reported to be related to differences in hormone levels,” the team wrote.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN) Kim Jong Un has been enjoying Donald Trump's presidency. After Trump's threats of "fire and fury" turned to love letters and handshakes, the North Korean leader has largely gotten a free pass on a lot of destabilizing activities -- including the short-range missile tests he ramped up in recent weeks. In fact, Kim's stayed in President Trump's good graces for longer than many of Trump's hand-picked cabinet secretaries.  Trump has touted his "success" with Kim as a foreign policy win, including from the White House podium at briefings on the coronavirus. Last Friday, Trump played down North Korea's recent illegal missile tests, lied about President Obama's track record on North Korea, selectively left out his own aggressive rhetoric toward Kim earlier in his presidency, and even said he received a "nice note" from Kim -- a point that the North Koreans denied.  While Trump seemed to confuse that coronavirus briefing with a campaign rally, the truth is that Kim had been pretty busy during the last few weeks doing what Kim does best: hurting his own people and making the world a more dangerous place. The DPRK is accused of lying about its claim of zero coronavirus infections and popping off rockets while his own people suffer from starvation, endemic health issues -- and, probably, Covid-19.  Now, though, Kim's pernicious public behavior has taken a back seat amid reports that he is in grave danger after surgery.  The speculation was fueled after the 36-year-old leader missed public celebrations for the most important holiday in North Korea -- the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. Other leaders have missed this celebration for North Korea's founding father in the past, and Kim could have been absent because of coronavirus concerns. But his no-show invariably prompted speculation about his health.  Read More
2020-04-21	The oil market is broken, and there's little to do to fix it but wait.  The US May oil contract settled at -$37.63 a barrel yesterday -- the first negative settlement in history. Storage facilities in America are running at capacity, which is what led the price to plummet. Plus the May contract is expiring today, which made for very erratic trading.  But what's really staggering about yesterday's negative price is that the US oil market might get fundamentally worse the coming month, said Paul Sankey, managing director at Mizuho Americas, a Japanese bank.  "This negative price was not a purely paper anomaly," but rather the meeting point of the financials and the physical realities of commodities, Sankey said in a research note today.  The physical reality of oil is that it is difficult to handle, volatile, potentially polluting, and actually useless without a refinery. If you had a stinking barrel of oil in your back yard, would you pay someone $100 a barrel to take it away? Yes, and you would probably be relieved you were not charged $300 a barrel," Sankey added.  The oil market is in a full-on day-to-day management crisis, he added, and that won't just go away.  Will we hit -$100 a barrel next month? Quite possibly," Sankey said.  Reducing production will take some time, Sankey said, so this situation of too much oil and nowhere to store it is here to stay. At least for now, and until demand picks up again.
2020-04-21	As several states make plans for reopening their communities during the coronavirus pandemic, a group of top public health experts cautioned Tuesday against reopening society before testing capacity expands significantly.  Different parts of the country are in different stages of the epidemic with New York well into the first wave and other places just beginning to see the impact of the disease. This matters, said Dr. Caroline Buckee, Harvard associate professor of epidemiology and the associate director of the university’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.  Knowing the location of the virus is key to relaxing social distancing and returning to normalcy, Buckee told a symposium sponsored by Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the New England Journal of Medicine.  The lack of testing capacity is a big problem because the disease has “a very broad clinical spread,” Buckee said. So even when people show up at the hospital and get tested there are many more cases in the community, including mild and asymptomatic cases. “And those are the people that are spreading the disease,” she said.  It’s important to learn whether people who have recovered can still spread the disease, noted NEJM editor Dr. Eric Rubin.  “What we really need is some epidemiological data to tell us, 'Are people who have left the hospital going on to transmit the disease?'” Rubin said. “That’s kind of the shoe leather epidemiology, contact tracing, following what happens to the context of those patients, which takes some manpower.  Buckee added that without knowing the answers, the nation could reopen too soon and risk a deadly second pandemic wave.  “Right now, we don’t have good estimates for where we are on the epidemic curve in different places. So, discussions of relaxation of physical distance, which do seem to be having an effect, curbing some of the worst impacts of the outbreak, need to be based on the capacity to test people so we know where we are,” she said.
2020-04-21	(CNN) Georgia's fervently pro-Trump governor's early breakout from a coronavirus shutdown is stirring fears of a deadly new wave of infections and warnings that he is derelict in his duty and acting on political motives.  The move, which is even more aggressive than President Donald Trump's optimistic call for a May 1 reopening, came after a week in which total US pandemic deaths doubled to more than 42,000. There is also no genuine sign that the Peach State's duel with the virus is anywhere near over. Kemp acted as fellow southern states South Carolina and Tennessee also announced plans to ease some social distancing measures.  The reopening decision is not just a huge risk for Kemp but the most aggressive leap by a US political leader to the reopening side of the conundrum that balances vicious job losses against shutdowns meant to suppress the virus as quickly as possible.  It's a wager with the health and ultimately the lives of many Georgia citizens and potentially the frontline medical workers who will treat newly infected patients that Kemp admitted will catch the disease.  It also appears to flout the logic of epidemiology and warnings by the top government infectious diseases specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was absent from the White House briefing Monday, that "there is still a long way to go" in battling the pandemic.  There is so far no vaccine or proven therapy for coronavirus, which can cause serious and fatal respiratory collapses in some patients, especially those who are elderly or have comprised immune systems. That's why aggressive social distancing is the only way to check the pathogen's spread.  Kemp's berth on the Trump train and the President's repeated agitating for the national economy to open quickly raises questions about whether Georgia's move is politically motivated.  It raises the prospect that Trump's hoped-for "beautiful puzzle" of state-by-state economic reopening could proceed on partisan rather than public health grounds.  Some states such as New York, Massachusetts and Michigan, which have Democratic governors, are currently approaching or just past peak infections. But there is no guarantee that more rural, Republican states will not become hotspots in future. And Kemp's move will also begin to fracture the remarkable national respect for social distancing that has alleviated some fears of ventilator shortages and dangerously overcrowded hospitals.  Opening comes against fraught political backdrop  Kemp laid his bet amid a cacophony of calls by opinion hosts on Fox News and other networks for a reopening of the economy that is vital to Trump's hopes of winning a second term.  Meanwhile, Trump has been offering encouragement to conservative activists who staged a series of protests across the country against stay-at-home requirements that they say infringe on basic American freedoms. State governors are beginning to worry that the protests could act as petri dishes for the virus to widen its spread.  Kemp's decision also appears to fly in the face of evidence from foreign states and territories such as Singapore and Hong Kong, and the city of Harbin in China, which saw coronavirus infections quickly erupt after social distancing restrictions were lifted or when residents returned from abroad.  Yet if Georgia manages to stave off a disaster, the state could become a blueprint for other areas that choose to live with a certain level of infections -- and by extension, deaths -- in order to alleviate the devastating toll on the economy that has shed more than 20 million jobs in a month.  If Kemp is forced to reintroduce social distancing measures though, his failure could deal a devastating blow to national reopening hopes and the desire of every American who is confined to their homes to a way out of lockdown misery.  "I think this is the right approach at the right time. It's not just throwing the keys back to these business owners," Kemp said, but admitted his move could cause more infections.  "We're probably going to have to see our cases continue to go up, but we're a lot better prepared for that now than we were over a month ago," he said, claiming Georgia had sufficient hospital beds, testing and knowledge to control the virus.  But Van Johnson, Savannah's Democratic mayor, told CNN's Erin Burnett that the decision "blows our minds."  "I am beyond disturbed. In my mind, it's reckless. Our reality here in Savannah is our numbers are still going up," Johnson said.  Stacey Abrams, who lost to Kemp in a controversial 2018 gubernatorial election and is a possible Democratic vice presidential pick , slammed the reopening as "dangerously incompetent" on Twitter.  Former George W. Bush administration adviser and renowned cardiologist Dr. Jonathan Reiner warned that Kemp's decision was "a dereliction of duty ... this crisis has not abated in that state."  Reiner said that the positivity rate of those tested in Georgia was an "enormous 23%." In Germany, which has had a widespread testing program and began a cautious reopening of small shops and business Monday, the positivity rate of a higher per capital testing level is 7%.  "In Georgia, the virus is still very, very active and this behavior is frankly reckless," he said on CNN.  Dr. Deborah Birx , who appeared beside Trump at the White House, declined to criticize Kemp directly, adding that each governor needed to assess their state's readiness.  "We have asked every governor to follow the guidelines," Birx said.  In its rather vague guidelines, the White House plan calls for a downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses reported within a 14-day period before incremental opening can begin.  But Georgia has not had a sustained downward trend over the last two weeks.  There were more than 5,700 new coronavirus cases last week. The number was 6% down on the week that ended April 12, when 6,000 cases were added, but it's still higher than the week that ended April 5, when fewer than 3,800 new cases were reported, according to figures collected by Johns Hopkins University and CNN.  Experts also say that the state's comparatively low testing rate means there may be many cases that are not detected.  Momentum toward reopening was swelled by South Carolina, which opened some stores at limited capacity on Monday. Tennessee, which has had 152 confirmed deaths and 7,238 cases, announced that the vast majority of businesses would open on May 1. The city of Jacksonville, Florida, reopened beaches.  Trump slams Maryland's GOP governor  An upbeat Trump on Monday dismissed claims from multiple governors that the rate of testing in the United States is insufficient to permit even lesser-hit states to begin easing restrictions.  Vice President Mike Pence told governors on a call on Monday about multiple sites and laboratories in their states that could conduct testing that the White House suggested the local authorities had not identified.  Medical professionals and governors say that there still is not sufficient testing even to diagnose people exhibiting symptoms of the illness. Some areas have testing kits but not the swabs or reagents needed to diagnose patients.  One governor, Republican Larry Hogan of Maryland, resorted to doing a deal with South Korea, brokered by his wife who is a native of the East Asian country, to bring in half a million testing kits.  Trump lashed out at Hogan, claiming there were already sufficient testing sites in his state.  "I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge -- would've been helpful," Trump said.  The White House has consistently predicted that testing is about to reach world-beating levels. But only just over 4 million tests have been conducted since early March. Public health experts and think tanks say there may be a need for millions of tests a day to permit the economy to be opened and new virus infections to be detected, traced to their source and for all the potential patients exposed to be isolated.  The President dismissed the idea that mass testing was necessary without giving any scientific or epidemiological justification.  "Not everybody believes we should do so much testing," Trump said. The President also recommitted himself to a prediction based on adjusted models used by the White House that the total number of US deaths could number around 60,000 through August.  Given the fast rising crest of fatalities, that figure now seems far too optimistic.
2020-04-22	(CNN) This year, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day comes in the midst of a pandemic. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to Bill Weir, CNN's chief climate correspondent, about the parallels between Covid-19 and climate change, as well as what it was like for Weir to welcome a new son into the world during such an uncertain time.  You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.  Bill Weir: My dearest River, I'm sorry we broke your sea and your sky. I'm sorry that the Great Barrier Reef is no longer great.  Dr. Gupta: That's my colleague Bill Weir, CNN's chief climate correspondent. He's reading a letter he wrote to his newborn son, River.  Weir: But alas, the milk in your bottle was warmed by dirty ancient fuels, and as a result, you're among the first babies ever to toddle on a planet this warm. We're just now wrestling with the implications of this. But for me, the most poignant evidence is that your mother was forced to give you your first kiss through a P100 mask.  Dr. Gupta: Today is Earth Day. A day for celebrating and appreciating our planet, and embracing the outdoors. But this year, many of us find ourselves stuck indoors, and with very little to celebrate.  Coronavirus has upended our lives, but it's also teaching us lessons about ourselves, and our planet.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is "Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."  Dr. Gupta: For this special Earth Day episode, I wanted to ask Bill about the connections between climate and coronavirus. Our conversation though started on a personal note ... the birth of his son 15 days ago.  Weir: So grateful to have this little bundle, this nugget of new life and love to focus on in the middle of this nightmare.  Dr. Gupta: I can only, only imagine. A huge congratulations to you and Kelly. What was the experience like in the hospital?  Weir: Well you know, they've really sort of sealed off the neonatal and maternity ward to keep it humming regardless of what was going on outside. The coronavirus patients are in a different building. So we came in and we had her in my mask that I used for covering wildfires. It was the only mask I could find. Almost bought one off of eBay for 600 bucks from some profiteer because we were so worried. But then I remembered I had this mask that I used to cover the last round of wildfires. And, you know, she kissed our baby through that mask for the first time, which is sort of a poignant parallel between, you know, climate crisis and the pandemic that we're in right now and how they all relate.  Dr. Gupta: Bill, one thing I just want to make sure we're making clear as well is there is a parallel between all the work you do and report on with regard to climate change and what is happening now with this pandemic. Right? I mean, if it's the infringements on these areas, deforestation ... what is the parallel between this pandemic and climate change?  Weir: I think the most obvious one is that for a very long time, very smart scientists said, "If we're not careful and we cut down all the jungles, we're going to unleash an invisible enemy that's gonna come out of those jungles and get into our lungs." But that was a story that few people wanted to hear. And for an even longer time, very smart scientists have been saying, "If we're not careful, an invisible enemy is going to come out of our factories and our cars and our homes. And it's going to get into the sky and the sea, and it's going to disrupt life as we know it. We're going to lose the ability to predict the weather."  And that was a story that too few people wanted to believe. And when it comes to the responses, look at the countries that waited until people started dying to act. They're the ones suffering the most. Whereas you look at South Korea, where they have a respect for expertise and a knowledge and a belief that we're all in this together and we can quench this thing. They flatten the curve. I mean, I'm so happy that "flatten the curve" is now part of our vernacular because we can do the same thing with climate. Whether that's a global effort of the smartest people around the world cooperating to either find a vaccine for this particular virus, or to come up with a way to power our lives in a clean, sustainable way.  Dr. Gupta: It is hard to believe that we're sort of in this self-quarantine on Earth Day. I mean, no matter how good your predictive skills are, I think very few people would have been able to predict that.  Weir: It was predicted! ... You know, there are just as, maybe not as many, scientists who've been warning about climate change for over a century. We've had virus hunters saying this was a very real hazard. But again, we're just not wired to think in these terms, I think. You know, we evolved to fear the noise behind the bush and try to figure out, "Is that a stick or a snake?" And we think about immediate threats, and time rubs the edges off of our fear. It's a reminder that when our smartest scientists say, "Something really bad could happen, if we're not careful" -- we should probably pay attention to that and certainly not politicize that.  Dr. Gupta: There's been a lot of pictures, and you see how quick things change in terms of the impact in the acute environment at least. The air's a little cleaner. There's the birds that are chirping in Wuhan, which I guess hadn't happened in a while. We get to see what happens when human activities on the planet come to somewhat of a halt. What does that teach us about the human impact on the environment?  Weir: Well, I think it teaches us just how much the human footprint is literally on everything. You know, that we have paved and plowed and developed so much of the Earth and there's so few places left, you know, where the wild things are. And, you know, creatures and ecosystems that took millions of years to settle into a harmonious balance. We have absolutely upended within a blink of Earth time. But they can bounce back if you give them space. There's this thing called the "sliding baseline syndrome," which is that, you know, you walk on a beach and with your kid and you say, "Man, when I was a boy, the stars, the Milky Way, it was incredible." He doesn't know what you're talking about. What he knows is what he can see, and so when he teaches his kids, the baseline has moved. Well, now that we've sort of reversed it for a brief moment in time and can show our kids, "That's what the Milky Way looks like."  Dr. Gupta: It is human psychology, I guess, to some extent, and maybe it's the way that we are wired for good reason, that acute threats are the things that we're gonna pay most attention to. But if the rock isn't about to hit me in the face, I'm probably not going to worry about it as much. How do you get the messages across? Because I think there's a lot of parallels here.  Weir: Yeah, I mean, when it comes to a pandemic, the most extreme measures you take will seem over the top before it happens and will seem, you know, completely inadequate after the fact. And it's kind of the same with climate. That will mean everything has to change. Everything. Transportation, construction, our food supply, geopolitics, economics. And that's such a seismic thing to a species that sort of likes things the way they are. That's such a big ask. And if we do all of those things, it will seem excessive. But if we don't do those things, it's going to change anyway.  Dr. Gupta: I'm wondering, Bill, for you, I'm sure talking to people who fully understand what you're saying. You talk to people who are flat out denying it. And then there are people in between who say, "I don't disagree with you, but it seems like the cat's out of the bag here. We're never getting that cat back in the bag." How do you have those conversations with people, especially with regard to the inevitability?  Weir: Yes, I think we have to be honest and you have to prepare our children for what's coming. If we could go back in time, six months, wouldn't we prepare our kids for this lockdown? Wouldn't we prepare them for saying goodbye to grandma for the last time? All of those sorts of things.  Dr. Gupta: You know, Bill, I think about our own childhood. I think we're around the same age. I don't really remember talking about climate change that much when I was a kid. No wars, good economy, no existential threat hanging over our heads, and obviously no pandemic. Not like this. And you're bringing a child into the world. I have kids who, their world has been defined by these things. I just wonder how do you think about that? I've been thinking about that a lot as a dad lately.  Weir: Yeah. No, I, believe me, especially in lockdown and staring into his little eyes during those midnight feedings. And you know, best scientists in the world say, "Life as we know it is at risk if we don't change our ways within a decade." And people scoff and say, "Well, the end of the world!" Yeah, well, like it's all going to explode on one Saturday afternoon. No, the planet will spin on. We're seeing how life can come back if you leave it alone. It's us that's at risk. It's life as we know it. It's the modern world that's built on predictable growing seasons and supply chains and flight schedules. And this is sort of what I think is a dry run for what my child's life is going to look like, only in hyper lapse, in hyper speed.  Dr. Gupta: Bill, you and I have been doing this job for a long time. And I'm reminded after disasters and even conflicts that, people forget. They move back to the way it was. Will this be different, do you think?  Weir: That's such a good question. You know, I think I'm worried that there's such a thing called "revenge pollution," that when a country like China has to shut down manufacturing, once they ramp back up, they, they go double time. They run the smokestacks 24/7. You know, the thing is, ultimately, while you can see the stars and people saying, "Oh, this might help fix our crisis." It won't. I would love to think that this is a wake-up call for these 7 billion-plus people on the planet. I'm afraid not. And I think it's going to take real leadership. And to solve the problem of climate demands such cooperation, both from allies and enemies. And unfortunately, Covid is the crisis that makes us all wear masks and has made the handshake obsolete when we need human connection more than ever. But I hope we understand that our relationship with this big blue marble, you know, every day is Earth Day. Every day is Earth Day. We exist at great peril if we forget that.  Dr. Gupta: The other day, I caught one of my teenage daughters getting up really early in the morning, and she loves to sleep, so I wasn't sure what was going on. But it turns out she wanted to watch the sunrise, since the skies have been unusually clear, thanks to the shutdown.  I wish my daughters lived in a world where the skies were always clear, and not just a rare sight.  Right now, we're seeing people around the world make sacrifices and unite against a common enemy. And it's frightening, for sure, but I also find it inspiring. Just shows what we can accomplish when we all work together.  Hopefully we can do the same to save our Earth and give our children a better future.  You can watch Bill's new documentary "The Road to Change" on CNN this Saturday.  We'll be back tomorrow.

2020-04-22	Britain's Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty leaves from 10 Downing Street in central London after attending the Government's daily COVID-19 briefing on April 14. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images  The UK will have to rely on social distancing measures until there is a vaccine or a treatment for coronavirus, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said during the daily Downing Street briefing on Wednesday.  “In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. One of which is highly effective vaccine, and there are a variety of ways vaccines can be deployed. They can be deployed for dampening down epidemics, they can be deployed to protect vulnerable people. Or, and or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people," Whitty said.  Whitty cautioned that achieving that goal will take time and that the outbreak will have to be managed through social distancing measure until then.  “Until we have those, and the probability of having those anytime in the next calendar year are incredibly small, and I think we should be realistic about that, we’re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive, as everyone is finding at the moment. But until that point, that is what we will have to do," Whitty said.  "But it's going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that," he added.
2020-04-22	Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf pictured on October 27, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, said he wants to reopen the state in three phases beginning May 8.  The governor's office broke down the phases into three colors: red, yellow and green:  The red phase , which currently applies to the whole state, has the sole purpose of minimizing the spread of Covid-19 through strict social distancing, non-life sustaining business and school closures, and building safety protocols.  , which currently applies to the whole state, has the sole purpose of minimizing the spread of Covid-19 through strict social distancing, non-life sustaining business and school closures, and building safety protocols. As regions or counties move into the yellow phase , some restrictions on work and social interaction will ease while others, such as closures of schools, gyms, and other indoor recreation centers, as well as limitations around large gatherings, remain in place. The purpose of this phase is to begin to power back up the economy while keeping a close eye on the public health data to ensure the spread of disease remains contained to the greatest extent possible.  , some restrictions on work and social interaction will ease while others, such as closures of schools, gyms, and other indoor recreation centers, as well as limitations around large gatherings, remain in place. The purpose of this phase is to begin to power back up the economy while keeping a close eye on the public health data to ensure the spread of disease remains contained to the greatest extent possible. The green phase eases most restrictions by lifting the stay-at-home and business closure orders to allow the economy to strategically reopen while continuing to prioritize public health. While this phase will facilitate a return to a “new normal,” it will be equally important to continue to monitor public health indicators and adjust orders and restrictions as necessary to ensure the spread of disease remains at a minimum.  By the numbers: Pennsylvania has a total of 35,684 Covid-19 cases and 1,622 deaths, Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said during a news conference today.  The state will not allow people to completely go back to work until there are less than 50 cases per 100,000 people for 14 days, the governor said.
2020-04-22	(CNN) Joe Biden's campaign is telling Democrats to hammer President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis by focusing on "the four 'C's": "The Chinese government," "cover-up," "chaos," and "corporate favoritism."  The new focus was outlined in a memo from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield that was sent to Democratic elected officials and strategists on Tuesday. It was first reported by Axios  "The bottom line: if Donald Trump had listened to Joe Biden, fewer Americans would be dying, losing loved ones, losing their jobs, or losing their retirement savings," Bedingfield's memo says.  It says that while the coronavirus is a global crisis, "Trump's failure is a uniquely American phenomenon." It contrasts the United States with countries such as South Korea, Canada and Germany, and says Trump is "responsible for unimaginable pain and suffering -- and we need to be clear and unshakeable in communicating this to the American people."  The memo signals a new willingness from Biden to make political critiques of Trump in a time of national emergency. It's a sharp departure from the early days of Biden's response to the pandemic, when he frequently said Trump was not to blame for the coronavirus but bore responsibility for the government's handling of the crisis. The two talked on the phone earlier this month about the coronavirus response, and both described it warmly afterward.  Biden, who has been off the campaign trail since early March, has criticized Trump in recent weeks in interviews conducted from his basement in Delaware.  But his campaign has struggled to break through, with the public health crisis and how the President and governors are handling it dominating national headlines.  Bedingfield's memo lays out four "critical errors" by Trump: "(1) The Chinese government: He praised its leader and did not fight anywhere near hard enough to get the facts. (2) Cover-up: He denied and downplayed the danger. (3) Chaos: His mismanaged response did not get us ready. (4) Corporate favoritism: He dithered when it came to using the Defense Production Act to require companies to produce tests and medical gear (and is still refusing to use it much at all -- plus, his bailout favors big companies and those with special access over small businesses)." It then delves into detail on each of those points.  The focus on China could be particularly key, with Trump and his campaign accusing Biden of a long record of appeasing Beijing.  The Trump campaign arm continues to push China as a major issue and a clear line of distinction between Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Several top campaign officials told CNN that China will continue to be a focus of the campaign's messaging and the campaign will make a big effort to tie American angst about the communist country back to Biden's record.  "China is one of the many vulnerabilities that Joe Biden has and we are going to use it," said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director. "It is one of many examples of foreign policy where he has been wildly wrong."  Still, sources say there are internal disagreements over how to move forward on the issue -- with political advisers like Kellyanne Conway urging Trump's campaign to hold off the China-focused ads for now, while other aides say it's the prime time to strike on this message.  Murtaugh said in response to the memo that Trump is "out front and in command" amid the coronavirus crisis.  "While the President is leading the nation in a war against the coronavirus, Joe Biden has decided to play the opposition in that war. He would rather score political points against President Trump than anything else. It used to be that we would unite as a country in times of crisis, but Biden has thrown that principle out the window," Murtaugh said.  Trump, though, has also sought to score political points during the pandemic.  He has attacked Biden and Democratic governors, including Washington's Jay Inslee and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, in personal terms at daily briefings ostensibly focused on the government's coronavirus response.
2020-04-22	(CNN) Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus have resulted in unprecedented reductions in deadly air pollution around the world, new analysis shows.  Major cities that suffer from the world's worst air pollution have seen reductions of deadly particulate matter by up to 60% from the previous year, during a three-week lockdowns period.  Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- studied 10 major cities around the world which have relatively high numbers of coronavirus cases and Covid-19 lockdown measures.  The study compared levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5. The pollutant, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks.  Seven out of the 10 cities studied, including New Delhi, Seoul, Wuhan and Mumbai, saw significant improvements in air quality. Those with historically higher levels of PM2.5 pollution witnessed the most substantial drops in pollution.
2020-04-22	(CNN) Lady Gaga released the track list for her upcoming album on Wednesday -- and one song collaboration has got K-pop fans screaming.  The album, titled "Chromatica," has a track titled "Sour Candy," which features none other than the queens of Blackpink.  Blackpink -- which consists of members Jennie, Lisa, Rosé and Jisoo -- has consistently dominated the music charts not only in South Korea, but also in the US , with hits like "Kill This Love" and "DDU-DU-DDU-DU."  Gaga's new 16-track album also includes "Stupid Love," which has already been released, and a song featuring Elton John called "Sine From Above." Another song, titled "Rain On Me," features Ariana Grande.  But many people sounding off in response to Gaga's tweet appear to be big Blackpink fans.
2020-04-22	Hong Kong (CNN Business) South Korea's economy just recorded its most severe contraction since the 2008 financial crisis as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on consumer demand and exports. And the worst may not be over.  Asia's fourth-largest economy shrank 1.4% in the January-to-March period compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, according to an estimate released Thursday by the Bank of Korea. The decline was slightly better than what analysts polled by Refinitiv expected, but still the worst in more than a decade.  The economy still grew by 1.3% when compared to a year earlier. But the rate of growth was slower than the 2.3% growth that the fourth quarter experienced year-on-year.  Consumer spending declined 6.4% from the prior quarter, while exports decreased 2%. South Korea was hit early by the virus, and at one point was home to one of the largest outbreaks outside of mainland China.  Since early March, though, the rate of daily infections has slowed dramatically — the country has roughly 10,700 recorded cases to date, with 238 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

2020-04-23	A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here  London (CNN Business) Economists and investors had been bracing for dismal economic data for this month. But the latest readings of the closely-watched Purchasing Managers' Index, which surveys senior executives at private sector companies, are gut-wrenchingly awful.  The numbers: The eurozone composite PMI, which tracks activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, hit 13.5 in April, down from 29.7 in March — easily the worst reading since the survey started in 1998.  It's a sign of the extent to which Europe's economy has imploded as shutdowns to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus hit citizens from Berlin to Paris and Amsterdam. The lowest reading during the global financial crisis was 36.2 in February 2009. Readings below 50 indicate that activity is shrinking.  "Welcome to the house of horror," Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.  PMI data from the United Kingdom and Japan on Thursday also turned up the worst declines in business output on record. The United States composite PMI reading for the services and manufacturing sectors hit 27.4, down from 40.9 in March.

Source: CNN  The world is "weeks to months" away from knowing what drugs will work to fight Covid-19, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's coronavirus response.  The WHO is tracking a number of studies that are trying to determine exactly how many people have been infected around the world, Van Kerkhove said.  According to one study in Germany, the number of people who have antibodies that show they've had the coronavirus infection ranges from 2% or 3% up to 14% of the population, she said during CNN's coronavirus town hall earlier tonight.  "What’s interesting about this is that these numbers, this seroprevalence, is a lot lower than some of the earlier models had predicted that would have suggested that this virus was circulating a lot more, and that much more of the population was already infected." Van Kerkhove said. "So these studies right now are not actually showing us that."  Seroprevalence is the number of people in a population who test positive for a disease.  The WHO is also closely monitoring the hundreds of Covid-19 drug trials.  "Everyone in the world wants to know which drugs, which medications are going to work, which medications are going to save lives," Van Kerkhove said. "Unfortunately, right now, we don't have any evidence one works, yet."  It’s critical that the studies are done and done well, Van Kerkhove said.  "So we can get to the answer that everybody needs," she said. The results, she added, "can't come soon enough." But the world is "weeks to months" from knowing what works.

"It's not about me. Nothing is about me," he said. The clips Trump played at the briefing praised himself and not health care workers.

2020-04-23	Intel (INTC) shares took a sharp dip after the closing bell Thursday, despite the company's strong earnings report for the first three months of 2020.  Intel reported earnings per share of $1.31, up 51% from the same period in the prior year, on $19.8 billion in quarterly revenue. Wall Street analysts had projected the company would make around $18.6 billion in revenue during the first quarter.  The chip maker's stock fell more than 5% in after-hours trading, though, after the company declined to provide financial guidance for the full year given the economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus. For the three months ending in June, Intel is projecting earnings per share of $1.04, up just 13% from the prior year.  “Our first-quarter performance is a testament to our team's focus on safeguarding employees, supporting our supply chain partners and delivering for our customers during this unprecedented challenge,” Intel CEO Bob Swan said in the earnings press release Thursday.  The shift for many companies to remote working set-ups amid coronavirus may have been a boon to Intel. Revenues from the company's data center group were up 43% to $7 billion during the quarter, which includes 53% year-over-year growth in cloud service provider revenue. Intel's PC business was also up 14%.  In a March 19 letter to customers, Swan called the technology industry "more essential now than it has ever been," and said Intel's manufacturing and production teams were maintaining on-time delivery rates above 90%.  But given the economic impact of coronavirus, analysts have wondered whether companies will be able to keep spending on enterprise tech services from firms such as Intel. On a call with analysts Thursday, Swan also acknowledged that demand in the second half of this year "remains more uncertain" because of the pandemic.

Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images  In Italy, at least 150 doctors have died after contracting coronavirus, the Italian Association of Doctors said on Friday.  Health care professionals account for about 10% of all infections, the organization said.  A separate Italian health care group, ANAAO, criticized the decree aimed at strengthening the health system, saying it's not good enough.  ANAAO called the measures set out in the Cura Italia decree — which is worth 25 billion euros ($27 billion) and was approved by the government on Friday — "completely disappointing."
2020-04-24	(CNN) When asked how much blame he thought President Donald Trump shared for the spread of coronavirus, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said, "I think in a crisis you don't want to divide people."  The Democratic Senate candidate then blurted out, "I can't restrain myself." He had to mention the country's lack of testing.  "That's the single essential component of addressing any seriously contagious pandemic," Hickenlooper said.  His conflicting impulses revealed an inner struggle for all of the challengers trying to wrest the Senate from Republicans: how to campaign during a crisis.  Last month, the Senate unanimously passed a $2 trillion-plus bill , the largest economic stimulus package in history. This week, it passed an additional $480 billion relief package without opposition.  The forceful response has again shown the power of incumbency. Senate Republicans in tough races across the country are noting to the dollar how much aid they've brought home, while Democratic challengers try to attack their opponents while aiming to unify the country during a terrible time.  In interviews with Hickenlooper and other challengers in the most competitive Senate races, it was clear that Democrats see an opening in the rocky implementation of the aid . In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham is "very concerned" about the lack of "vigorous and meaningful mechanisms for oversight." In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon said "there is no doubt" that the lack of testing and personal protective equipment "is because of a lack of federal leadership." And in Colorado, Hickenlooper is worried not only about testing but also that the small business loan program Congress gave hundreds of billions of dollars to prioritizes larger companies with connections rather than smaller ones.  Still, the Democrats had an urge to soften any blow against the President.  After criticizing the Trump administration's coordination of the supply chain with state governments, Gideon told CNN, "I try not to think about how we throw stones in there, but we acknowledge where the deficiencies and leadership are so that we can come together and overcome them."  In their attempt to take back the Senate this year, Democrats enjoy a number of advantages: an unpopular Republican President , a map putting them on offense and several strong recruits who raised more money in the first quarter of 2020 than their opponents. Knocking off four Republicans -- or three if Democrats win the White House -- to flip the Senate is within their reach.  But the virus has suddenly changed the daily life of Americans — and the campaigns to elect their leaders along with it. In the United States, over 843,000 people had tested positive for the virus and over 46,000 had died, according to CNN's tally as of Thursday evening. Americans have been told to stay at home. Businesses, schools and churches have closed. The stock market has tanked. In the past six weeks, over 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits  In such a dismal environment, politicians have to balance how to make their points without appearing petty. Some campaigns have not only turned virtual, but more charitable. Hickenlooper's has contacted 200,000 Coloradans "just to check in" and has raised money online for the Restaurant Workers Relief Fund. Gideon's campaign staff has donated blood and brought groceries to people who are at risk. In Arizona, Democrat astronaut Mark Kelly raised thousands for the Arizona Food Bank Network, while Republican Sen. Martha McSally spent 15 days raising thousands more for the Salvation Army.  Meanwhile, many Republican senators are running on the billions they've sent to their states.  In Maine, Majority Forward, an outside group affiliated with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, released an ad saying, "Once again, Susan Collins defends the President" despite a lack of PPE.  Collins campaign spokesman Kevin Kelley responded this week, saying 600,000 pieces were sent to Maine -- according to the head of the state's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- enough to fill six tractor trailers with items like N95 masks, surgical masks, face shields and gloves. The senator's campaign is up with a response ad, highlighting that Collins helped secure over $2 billion for loans to Maine small businesses in the recent legislation. "So while they spend millions on lies, Susan keeps working for Maine," the ad's narrator says.  In response to the aid appropriated for Maine, Gideon told CNN that she's "glad to see some of the things that they have done."  "I know Senator Collins is trying very hard to lift those things up and take credit for them but we are going to continue to point out what else needs to be done and to also contrast the work that is being done there in the US Senate with the ways we have met people's needs here in the state of Maine and under my leadership in the legislature as well," she added.  What's happening in Maine is happening in the other races crucial to Senate control.  GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina claims to have secured over $9.5 billion for his state, including $8 billion in loans for small businesses and over $1.5 billion for health care providers, higher education institutions and airports. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner has obtained for his state 100,000 N95 masks from Taiwan and claimed to get tens of thousands of test kits from South Korea. (In April, he told The Colorado Sun that "nobody gives a s*** about the campaign — they are worried about themselves, their businesses, their families, how they are going to put food on the table.")  Some Democrats maintain that the pandemic has only reinforced their health care-first campaign focus.  "It just magnifies the issues that we were already talking about -- some basic health care should be a right not a privilege," said Hickenlooper, who briefly ran for his party's presidential nomination last year.  Cunningham told CNN that he's hearing "an awful lot about the need for us to close very real gaps in medical coverage" in part because Tillis, as state House speaker, did not help North Carolina expand Medicaid. (Tillis' campaign did not respond to a CNN request for comment.)  Cunningham also nodded to the purple nature of his state, which Trump carried in 2016, saying that even before the pandemic, he pledged to work with whoever the next president is -- Trump or former vice president Joe Biden -- and hold them accountable.  "My job is going to be to give voice to North Carolina," he said.
2020-04-24	Tokyo (CNN) The mayor of Japan's third-largest city is facing a public backlash after he suggested men are better suited to grocery shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, because women take too long and contribute to overcrowding at supermarkets.  The number of confirmed cases of the virus in Japan has spiked in recent weeks -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread. As of Thursday, Japan had 11,950 confirmed cases, including 299 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. On March 1, the country had 243 cases.  That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place nationwide. On Thursday, Osaka mayor Ichiro Matsui implied male grocery shoppers would reduce the potential spread of the virus as they would spend less time in stores.  "Women take a longer time grocery shopping because they browse through different products and weigh out which option is best," Matsui told reporters at a coronavirus press conference in Osaka on Thursday.  "Men quickly grab what they're told to buy so they won't linger at the supermarket -- that avoids close contact with others," added Matsui.  Read More
2020-04-25	Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, two of President Donald Trump's key coronavirus advisers and public faces of the crisis, donned masks and were shown into "the tank" which is the Pentagon's secure conference room. They were there to meet with Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Vice Chairman Gen. John Hyten to discuss the military's efforts to manage the coronavirus pandemic and the medical expertise needed to protect the country's 1.4 million military personnel.  The meeting underscored a critical national security issue that has not been publicly discussed in detail by the President, the challenge of ensuring the military is ready to deploy and fight amid the pandemic.  As the country prepares for a possible second wave of the virus this fall, the obstacles facing the Pentagon are massive. They range from assembling robust testing capabilities to ensuring there is a constantly replenished supply of personal protective equipment, while all the while continuing to provide medical personnel to support the civilian healthcare system.  And beyond keeping the military functioning there's a realization within the that the pandemic could upend geopolitics and create new and unpredictable threats to US national security.  One of the clearest indicators of the level of concern within the Pentagon is the fact Defense Secretary Mark Esper has put strict limits on the amount of information being shared with the American public. While it does publish information each day on the number of personnel who have tested positive for the virus, the military is not releasing information that it believes would reveal weaknesses in US readiness that could exploited by adversaries.  "The Department of Defense will continue to balance transparency in this crisis with operations security," the Pentagon said in a policy statement on its website.  The sense that the Pentagon is not being transparent was compounded on Friday when it was revealed that Esper had not been immediately prepared to accept a recommendation that Capt. Brett Crozier be restored to command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier which has been sidelined after a major outbreak of the virus. Though Esper made it known he wanted to read the full investigation before accepting the decision.  Crozier was fired earlier this month for what the then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.  Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.  Reasons to worry  There are plenty of reasons to worry as the coronavirus crisis continues. The military has long had basic plans on the shelf for how to deal with a pandemic. When the virus first began to spread widely, the Pentagon sent thousands of workers home to telework and top commanders began wearing masks and social distancing. In highly secure command centers at the Pentagon and at US Northern Command in Colorado, crisis teams assembled but carefully made sure they worked in separate areas in case there was an outbreak.  The virus prompted the military to cancel exercises, briefly halted the process of bringing in recruits and put the Roosevelt back in port after more than 800 sailors tested positive and one died after an outbreak on board.  Now, more than 40 navy warships have had one or more sailors test positive, and on Friday, CNN learned there are at least 18 cases aboard the USS Kidd which is at sea in the Eastern Pacific and must now find a port to which it can return. The number of cases had risen to 33 by Saturday, according to the Navy.  There are nearly 4,000 cases among the active duty force, but the Roosevelt outbreak has caused the most anxiety in the military medical community.  "This is a stealthy virus in many ways and this outbreak investigation is an important medical weapon to understand its behavior so that we can better protect the crew, their shipmates on other vessels and ultimately the nation," said Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, US Navy Surgeon General last week.  The Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating on a study to try to determine how the virus spread across the entire ship even with isolation measures in place. The fact 120 sailors previously asymptomatic have tested positive raises questions about the limitations of the current testing system.  Testing alone, "does not enable us at this time to improve our readiness and availability," Hyten told reporters at the Pentagon this week. He also cautioned that some Troops still test positive after 14 days of isolation even if they are originally asymptomatic.  A plan has now been approved by Esper for prioritizing who in the military will be tested first. It is based on the critical need to keep the military running and being able to meet international threats.  The first tier to be tested are forces dedicated to nuclear deterrence such as intercontinental ballistic missile and bomber crews as well as critical special operations forces units that are always on alert for possible counter terrorism missions. The second tier will be forces posted around the world including Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and South Korea. Next will be forces about to deploy, or forces about to return, and after that all other service members.  New recruits are also being prioritized and the goal is to test 60,000 military personnel a day, but that goal won't be reached for months. "To get to the entire force, the 1.4 million active duty and the entire Guard and Reserve, is going to take us into the summer," says Hyten.  No more 'business as usual'  Beyond the practical goal of maintaining readiness, there's a growing understanding that the nature of the US military, what it does, and the concept of what constitutes a national security threat may be changed by the pandemic.  "Is it back to business as usual? No, I don't see that," Milley observed earlier this month at the Pentagon.  When he was asked about what happens next Milley suggested the pandemic means the nature of threats to the US are changing.  "There are countries out there, states that are very fragile, that are in various states of civil war or they have violence internal to their societies, there's significant stress, as a result of this COVID-19 virus."  Milley said because of the pandemic there is risk of more instability in politically and economically fragile countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. 'So no, it's not going to be business as usual. We've got to take a hard look at how we as a military, we as a Department of Defense conduct operations in the future," he added.  The military will have to understand what "lessons' it has learned so it can be effective in the post pandemic world, Milley went on to say.  It's too soon to have a definitive answer on what happens next, but with a $700 billion budget and massive bureaucracy, some framing questions will need to be answered to avoid the military's classic problem that huge budgets are devoted to weapons systems such as armored tanks designed to fight threats from conflicts that are becoming less relevant.  Without question, the military must still be able fulfill critical tasks such as providing a credible nuclear deterrent and fighting terrorism. But many defense contractors have furloughed workers, so it's not even possible to calculate when everyone will be back to work with production lines fully running again, let alone the impact on critical research efforts into advanced technologies and materials.  Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN that any defense secretary will need 'peripheral vision' to deal with the coming challenges.  "You constantly have to review what you are doing, how you have been doing it, and match that with the challenges of the day," Hagel said.  That's the challenge, the Pentagon will have to anticipate and react with agility because the next major threat might not come from China or Russia. It could be another pandemic, a cyberattack or even climate change that cripples a military which is still reliant on the billions spent on traditional ships, aircraft, tanks and missiles.  CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to more precisely describe the number of coronavirus cases on Navy ships.

2020-04-26	(CNN) Preliminary results from a clinical trial of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug being tested for coronavirus, could come in as little as one to two weeks, a top researcher said Sunday.  The final results aren't expected until mid-to-late May, said Dr. Andre Kalil, a principal investigator for the trial. But he said "we can potentially have some early data in the next one or two weeks," contingent on a preliminary analysis.  "In the next few weeks, we're going to do the analysis, and we're going to basically know if remdesivir is better or not than placebo," he told CNN.  Remdesivir was originally tested by Gilead Sciences as a potential treatment for Ebola, and it showed activity against the novel coronavirus in test tubes. But whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19 remains unclear, and data released thus far have been conflicting and limited  The new study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. That means it compares patients who received remdesivir with those who didn't, and neither the patients nor the doctors treating them know who is receiving the real drug and who is receiving a placebo.
2020-04-27	(CNN Business) The morning after Ian Lahiffe returned to Beijing, he found a surveillance camera being mounted on the wall outside his apartment door. Its lens was pointing right at him.  After a trip to southern China, the 34-year-old Irish expat and his family were starting their two-week home quarantine, a mandatory measure enforced by the Beijing government to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus  He said he opened the door as the camera was being installed, without warning.  "(Having a camera outside your door is) an incredible erosion of privacy," said Lahiffe. "It just seems to be a massive data grab. And I don't know how much of it is actually legal."  A surveillance camera was installed outside Ian Lahiffe's front door the morning after he returned to Beijing.  Although there is no official announcement stating that cameras must be fixed outside the homes of people under quarantine, it has been happening in some cities across China since at least February, according to three people who recounted their experience with the cameras to CNN, as well as social media posts and government statements.  China currently has no specific national law to regulate the use of surveillance cameras, but the devices are already a regular part of public life: they're often there watching when people cross the street, enter a shopping mall, dine in a restaurant, board a bus or even sit in a school classroom.  More than 20 million cameras had been installed across China as of 2017, according to state broadcaster CCTV . But other sources suggest a much higher number. According to a report from IHS Markit Technology, now a part of Informa Tech, China had 349 million surveillance cameras installed as of 2018, nearly five times the number of cameras in the United States.  China also has eight of the world's 10 most surveilled cities based on the number of cameras per 1,000 people, according to UK-based technology research firm Comparitech  But now the pandemic has brought surveillance cameras closer to people's private lives: from public spaces in the city right to the front doors of their homes — and in some rare cases, surveillance cameras inside their apartments.  CNN has requested comment from China's National Health Commission. The Ministry of Public Security did not accept CNN's faxed requests for comment.  Evolution of tactics  China is already using a digital "health code" system to control people's movements and decide who should go into quarantine. To enforce home quarantine, local authorities have again resorted to technology — and have been open about the use of surveillance cameras.  A sub-district office of the government in Nanjing, in eastern Jiangsu province, said it had installed cameras outside the doors of people under self-quarantine to monitor them 24 hours a day — a move that "helped save personnel expenditures and increased work efficiency," according to its February 16 post on Weibo, China's twitter-like platform.  In Hebei province, the Wuchongan county government in the city of Qianan also said it was using surveillance cameras to monitor residents quarantined at home, according to a statement on its website. In the city of Changchun in northeastern Jilin province, the quarantine cameras in Chaoyang district are powered with artificial intelligence to detect human shapes, the district government said on its website  In the eastern city of Hangzhou, China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, helped the local governments install 238 cameras to monitor home-quarantined residents as of February 8, the company said in a Weibo post  On Weibo, some people posted photos of cameras they said were newly put up outside their doors, as they went into home quarantine in Beijing, Shenzhen, Nanjing and Changzhou, among other cities.  Some appeared to accept the surveillance, although it remains unclear how much criticism against the measure is tolerated on the country's closely monitored and censored internet. A Weibo user, who went into home quarantine after returning to Beijing from Hubei province, said she was told in advance by her neighborhood committee that a camera and an alarm would be installed on her front door. "(I) fully respect and understand the arrangement," she wrote  Another Beijing resident said he did not think the camera was necessary, "but since it is a standard requirement, (I'm) happy to accept it," wrote a person who identified himself as Tian Zengjun, a lawyer in Beijing.  Others, worried about the virus' spread in their communities, called for local authorities to install surveillance cameras to ensure people obey quarantine rules.  Jason Lau, a privacy expert and professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, said people across China had grown accustomed to prevalent surveillance long before the coronavirus.  "In China, people probably already assume that the government has access to a lot of their data anyway. If they think the measures are going to keep them safe, keep the community safe and are in the best interest of the public, they may not worry too much about it," he said.  Cameras inside homes  Some people say cameras have even been placed inside their homes.  William Zhou, a public servant, returned to the city of Changzhou, in eastern Jiangsu province, from his native Anhui province in late February. The next day, he said a community worker and a police officer came to his apartment and set up a camera pointing at his front door -- from a cabinet wall inside his home.  Zhou said he did not like the idea. He asked the community worker what the camera would record and the community worker showed him the footage on his smartphone.  "I was standing in my living room and the camera captured me clearly in its frame," said Zhou, who asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.  William Zhou, who was home quarantined in the city of Changzhou, said a camera was installed inside his apartment.  Zhou was furious. He asked why the camera couldn't be placed outside instead, but the police officer told him it might get vandalized. In the end, he said the camera stayed on the cabinet despite his strong protest.  On that evening, Zhou said he called the mayor's hotline and the local epidemic control command center to complain. Two days later, two local government officials turned up at his door, asking him to understand and cooperate with the government's epidemic control efforts. They also told him the camera would only take still images when his door moved and wouldn't record any video or audio.  Installing it inside my home is a huge invasion of my privacy William Zhou, Changzhou resident  But Zhou remained unconvinced.  "(The camera) had a huge impact on me psychologically," he said. "I tried not to make phone calls, fearing the camera would record my conversations by any chance. I couldn't stop worrying even when I went to sleep, after I closed the bedroom door."  Zhou said he would have been fine with having the camera placed outside his front door, because he wouldn't open the door to go out anyway.  "Installing it inside my home is a huge invasion of my privacy," he said.  William Zhou said the camera was installed on the cabinet wall next to his front door.  Zhou said two other residents who were under quarantine in his residential compound told him they also had cameras installed inside their homes.  The epidemic control command center of the district Zhou lives in confirmed to CNN the use of cameras to enforce home quarantine, but declined to give further details.  In the eastern city of Nanjing, the Chunxi sub-district government posted photos on Weibo showing how authorities were using cameras to ensure quarantine. One photo showed a camera standing on a cabinet inside an apartment. Another showed a screenshot of footage of four cameras, some of which appeared to have been shot from inside people's homes.  The Chuxi sub-district government declined to comment. The epidemic control command center in the district said the installation of cameras was not a mandatory policy, and some sub-district governments have chosen to adopt the measure themselves.  A photo released by the Chunxi government showed a camera standing on a cabinet inside an apartment.  How do the cameras work?  There is no official tally on the number of cameras installed to enforce home quarantine across China. But the Chaoyang district government in Jilin, a city of four million people, said in a statement that it had installed 500 cameras as of February 8.  Around the world, governments have adopted less intrusive technologies to track whether a person leaves their apartment. In Hong Kong, for example, all international arrivals undergoing a two-week home quarantine must wear an electronic bracelet , which connects to a smartphone app that alerts authorities if they stray from their apartments or hotel rooms. South Korea uses an app that tracks locations with GPS and sends alerts when people leave quarantine. Last month, Poland launched an app that allows people under quarantine to send selfies to let authorities know they're staying home.  Even in Beijing not everyone in home quarantine has a camera outside their home. Two residents, who recently returned to the city from Wuhan, said they had a magnetic alarm installed to their apartment doors, which would notify community workers if they stepped outside. CNN has reached out to Beijing authorities for comment.  Passengers receive quarantine tracking wrist bands at Hong Kongs international airport on March 19.  Lahiffe, the Irish expat who lives in Beijing, believes the footage from his camera is being monitored by the community workers at his residential compound, who are charged with making sure he stays home and doesn't have visitors -- all from a smartphone.  "The guy's phone has an app which (shows) all the doors," Lahiffe said of one of the community workers who had come to install the camera. "You can see all the doors of the different cameras that have been installed," he said, adding that he saw more than 30 doors on the app, all from his residential complex which he says is lived in by "mostly foreigners."  In China, every urban residential community is managed by a neighborhood committee, a communist legacy from the Mao era that has now become the foundation of a "grid management" system of social control supported by high tech and big data. Officially, these are self-governing bodies that manage and educate residents. But they also serve as the governments' eyes and ears at the grassroots level, helping to maintain stability by watching over millions of residents nationwide and reporting suspicious activities.  Since the outbreak, community workers have been given great leeway and tasked with epidemic control in residential compounds, enforcing home quarantine, as well as helping quarantined residents with basic needs, such as delivering food and groceries to their doors and taking out their trash.  Lina Ali said the camera installed outside her front door would shine a bright light whenever she opened the door to get food delivery.  Whenever Lina Ali, a Scandinavian expat living in the southern city of Guangzhou, opened her front door to receive food deliveries, she said a bright light shone from the camera that was trained on her apartment door while she was in quarantine.  She said her apartment building's property management staff came to install a surveillance camera outside her front door on the first day of her home quarantine earlier this month.  "I hated when the camera would shine a bright light, they told us that it connects to the police station," said Ali. CNN agreed to refer to her with a pseudonym to protect her safety. "It made me feel like I truly was a prisoner in my own home."  CNN has reached out to Guangzhou authorities for comment.  In Shenzhen, the cameras used to monitor quarantined residents in one district were connected to the smartphones of police officers and community workers, according to a report on the district government's website.  If someone breached their quarantine, the report said,"police and community workers will receive an alert immediately notifying them something is wrong."  A phone screenshot of an app used by authorities to monitor the footage of cameras installed for people under home quarantine in Nanshan district, Shenzhen.  Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there was a wide range of measures governments can take to protect public health in the pandemic, but "they don't necessarily have to blanket society with surveillance devices."  "If you look at China's surveillance measures during the coronavirus outbreak, from the development of health codes to installation of surveillance cameras to enforce quarantine, we're seeing an increasingly intrusive use of surveillance technologies that were previously only seen in particularly repressed regions, like Xinjiang," she said, referring to the far western region home to China's Uyghur minority.  "The surveillance measures being implemented during Covid-19, are unfortunately — if not pushed back — going to live with us for a very long time."  The legal stance  China currently has no specific national law to regulate the use of surveillance cameras in public spaces. The Ministry of Public Security released a draft regulation on security cameras in 2016, but the ordinance is still waiting to be approved by the country's national legislature. In recent years, some local governments have issued their own regulations on the cameras.  Tong Zongjin, a lawyer based in Beijing, said installing cameras outside a person's front door has always been in a legal gray area.  "The area outside a person's front door is not part of their private residence and is considered a communal space. But the camera can be monitoring something personal, such as when the individual leaves and comes home," he said.  Adding to the complexity of the issue is that these cameras are installed by authorities during a public health emergency for epidemic control purposes, so an individual's privacy has to be balanced against public interest and safety, Tong said.  A worker adjusts security cameras on the edge of Tiananmen Square in Beijing on September 30, 2014.  On February 4, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a directive , calling on regional cyberspace authorities to "actively make use of big data, including personal information, to support epidemic prevention and control work," while protecting people's personal information.  The directive bans the collecting of personal data for epidemic control without consent from organizations that have not received the approval from health authorities under China's cabinet, the State Council.  It also said the collection of personal information should be limited to "key groups" such as confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients and their close contacts, and that the information collected should not be used for other purposes, or be made public without consent. Organizations that collect personal information should adopt strict measures to protect data from being stolen or leaked, the document said.  Lau, the privacy expert, said under Chinese law, organizations with the authority to collect and report personal information concerning public health emergencies include national and regional health authorities, medical institutions, disease prevention and control authorities, as well as local authorities such as townships and resident committees authorized by the government and emergency command headquarters.  "Of course, the government will try to collect as much data as they can to help stop the spread of the virus," he said. But the government needs to consider if the collection of data is appropriate, necessary and proportionate, and assess if there are other less privacy intrusive methods to do the same thing, he added.  A passenger wearing a face mask uses a smartphone to scan a Wuhan city health QR code before entering the Tianhe Airport.  A new era of digital surveillance?  Earlier this month, over 100 rights and privacy organizations around the globe issued a joint statement to call on governments to ensure the use of digital technologies to track and monitor citizens during the pandemic is carried out in line with human rights.  "States' efforts to contain the virus must not be used as a cover to usher in a new era of greatly expanded systems of invasive digital surveillance," the statement said.  "Technology can and should play an important role during this effort to save lives, such as to spread public health messages and increase access to health care. However, an increase in state digital surveillance powers, such as obtaining access to mobile phone location data, threatens privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association, in ways that could violate rights and degrade trust in public authorities -- undermining the effectiveness of any public health response," it said.  I can't bear the thought that our everyday lives are completely exposed to the government's scrutiny. William Zhou, Changzhou resident  For now, it appears that the surveillance cameras on people's front doors are not there to stay. After Ali and Zhou finished their quarantine, they said the cameras were taken down.  The community workers told Zhou he could keep the camera for free. But Zhou was so furious about having to live under its gaze for two weeks that he said he took out a hammer and smashed the device in front of the community workers.  "If surveillance cameras are placed in public places, there's no problem -- they can monitor and deter unlawful acts. But they shouldn't appear in our private spaces," he said.  "I can't bear the thought that our everyday lives are completely exposed to the government's scrutiny."

2020-04-27	Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir speaks during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, on April 27. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images  Admiral Brett Giroir, director of US coronavirus testing, said the federal government will continue to help states procure supplies for testing, despite new guidelines that describe it as a “supplier of last resort” in obtaining tests.  “It’s very important that I think we don’t interrupt our commercial channels, because they’re very efficient and this is what they do, but we do have to prioritize them,” Giroir told reporters at the White House on Monday.  “Some of the larger companies, the testing companies, we need to make sure that the states that have a certain machine or a certain test are adequately supplied until we get 10 times the amount that we need," he added.  Giroir described supplies like swabs as a “small, fragile ecosystem right now.”  “For the next couple of months, we’re going to procure them at the federal level to make sure they’re distributed to the states,” he said, “but towards the middle or the end of the summer that supply chain will be very robust.”  Starting as early as late next week, Giroir said, “for say, swabs and media, we know what the plan is.  "We’re going to be sending the states what they need every week without them asking,” he said.
2020-04-27	A health official, right, takes the temperature of a patient looking to be tested, before entering a government-run testing centre in Lagos, Nigeria, on Thursday, April 23. Sunday Alamba/AP  Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the country’s coronavirus lockdown in three major states —Abuja, Lagos and Ogun — for another week until May 4.  In a national address Monday evening, Buhari said the country will phase into an eased lockdown period, with some businesses and sectors being allowed to open after the total lockdown period ends on May 4. After this date, there will also be overnight curfews from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time in the three states.  Meanwhile, the northern state of Kano will be place under total lockdown for two weeks because of a spike in the number of deaths in the region. These deaths have not been officially linked to coronavirus. However, autopsies have not been carried out because they are not in line with Islamic burial practices in the state, officials said.  Nigeria first introduced lockdowns for the three worst affected states on March 30. This was then extended for a further two weeks by the President.  Buhari added that Nigeria's Center for Disease Control on Monday accredited 15 laboratories nationwide with an aggregate capacity to undertake 2,500 tests per day across the country. Nigeria has only tested around 10,000 people so far, out of a population of 200 million.  As of Monday, the country has recorded 1,273 positive Covid-19 cases and 40 deaths, according to the NCDC.
2020-04-27	(CNN) A high-level North Korean defector has suggested it's likely that Kim Jong Un has health issues of some kind, but cautioned against reading too much into conflicting reports on the status of the North Korean leader, insisting only a handful of people have access to the truth.  Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who was elected to South Korea's parliament earlier this month, told CNN that Kim's absence from celebrations marking the birth of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, point to a physical ailment of some type.  Known as the Day of the Sun, April 15 is the country's most significant date. In previous years, it's been marked with newsworthy events, such as satellite launches and large-scale military parades.  "Kim Jong Un is not only the leader of North Korea, but he is the grandson of Kim Il Sung ... to North Korean eyes it is really abnormal," said Thae, of Kim's absence from official events. "I'm not quite sure whether he really had some surgery or whatever, but one thing is clear... he cannot stand up by himself or walk properly," Thae told CNN.  Thae's comments, for which he did not provide any supporting evidence, follow mounting speculation about Kim's health and whereabouts. Last week, CNN reported that the United States is monitoring intelligence that Kim is "in grave danger after a surgery," according to a US official.  Read More
2020-04-28	This analysis was excerpted from the April 28 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.  (CNN) US President Donald Trump says he knows how his despotic North Korean pen pal is doing ... he's just not telling.  "I do have a very good idea, but I can't talk about it now," Trump said, when asked about speculation that Kim Jong Un is gravely ill or may already be dead. " I just wish him well ," Trump said at the White House on Monday.  He had already divulged more intelligence about the most pressing foreign policy crisis not involving the coronavirus than a normal President would have. But being Trump, he couldn't resist adding a tantalizing morsel that will send foreboding about what is next in the Stalinist hermit state skyrocketing.  "You'll probably be hearing in the not too distant future," he said. "Nobody knows where he is."  The implications of Kim's death would be momentous, even if in life the erratic North Korean leader has often been a source of instability in Northeast Asia. Given that he has no obvious heir, a power struggle in an impoverished nation bristling with nuclear weapons and with a million men under arms is a real risk. Even worse, an internal collapse in North Korea — with the possibility of a refugee exodus into China across the Demilitarized Zone into South Korea — in the middle of a pandemic is a horror scenario.

2020-04-28	Hong Kong (CNN) On Sunday, Andrew Adonis, a member of Britain's House of Lords and onetime cabinet minister, took aim at the idea that the coronavirus pandemic was causing a crisis of capitalism.  "Lots of instant commentary on 'how Covid-19 will change the world' calls it a 'crisis of capitalism'. Wrong," he wrote on Twitter . "It's a 'crisis of communism'. It became a global pandemic through Xi's communist regime China."  While it's debatable how communist modern China actually is, Adonis is not alone in his complaint. Numerous Western politicians, particularly on the right, have blamed China's government and political system for causing the current global crisis. Many have continued to hammer phrases such as "China flu" or "Wuhan virus," despite warnings that such terms could lead to increased hostility against Asians. Even those critics who try to avoid ethnically-tinged labels often speak of a "CPC virus" or "Xi flu," named after country's ruling party, the Communist Party of China and its leader, President Xi Jinping, respectively.  It's safe to say that China's brand has taken a hit due to the virus. According to Pew Research , Americans' opinion of China is at its lowest point in 15 years, and 62% of those surveyed said they viewed China's power and influence as a "major threat."  But for some, the Beijing model is not necessarily looking so bad. China, despite being where the virus first emerged, has coped with the ensuing pandemic far better than many other countries, even though those countries had a longer warning time and greater chance to prepare.  sector. The crisis has also highlighted the benefits of a strong government and centralized planning, while -- despite Adonis's claims to the contrary -- exposing the limitations of private industry to respond quickly, particularly in the healthcare  Speaking to Der Spiegel earlier this month, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the virus had exposed the problems at the heart of both the Chinese and US models. Asked which was being proven superior, Maas said "neither."  "China has taken some very authoritarian measures, while in the US, the virus was played down for a long time," he told the magazine. "There are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for Europe."  JUST WATCHED Trump promoted these drugs nearly 50 times. He abruptly stopped. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump promoted these drugs nearly 50 times. He abruptly stopped. 01:54  New diplomacy  While Germany may be able to afford to strike out its own path -- and has seen success in dealing with the coronavirus -- other countries, forever pulled between the competing poles of Beijing and Washington, may be swayed by how the current crisis is playing out.  Certainly, China's leaders, and their vast propaganda apparatus, have not been blind to the opportunity this presents. For weeks state media has been playing up the disorder around the world as it praises Beijing's own handling of the crisis, shoring up power and support at home -- but it has also taken aim at those already sympathetic to China who could be pulled further into the fold.  As the US has increasingly looked inward -- both due to the requirements of the crisis and Trump's own "America first" instincts -- China has been playing up the importance of "multilateralism," calling for the shoring up of global institutions and offering assistance to anyone that needs it. In particular, China has emerged as the strongest defendant of the World Health Organization (WHO) as it faces pressure from Washington.  "The United Nations will be 75 this year, Covid-19 is reminding countries of the continuous, and increasing value of multilateralism in a closely connected world. We will only halt Covid-19 through solidarity. No country can do it alone," the Communist Party-controlled state owned mouthpiece China Daily said in an editorial this month  This advocacy of international cooperation might once have been put forward by the US. But just as China stepped into the role of free-trade defender as Trump pulled back , so too is it attempting to occupy Washington's traditional space at the UN and other multinational bodies.  Since March, Xi has had at least two dozen phone calls with other world leaders. Speaking to Trump last month, he said that "the international community must respond together if it is to win this battle," according to a readout from Beijing.  Writing last month , the European Union's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, said there is an ongoing "global battle of narratives," in which "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner." In part, Borrell said, this was through highlighting its assistance to other countries, such as by sending medical supplies and experts to aid with the coronavirus response.  This coronavirus diplomacy is paying off. In a tweet (written in Chinese) this month, Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif praised Beijing for coming to his country's aid, saying the coronavirus was "deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries." Serbian President Aleksander Vucic was shown on Chinese state broadcaster CGTN kissing the country's flag as he greeted a support team sent from Beijing. "Serbian people will never forget this kindness, China is an old friend and will continue to be for generations to come," he said later.

But this isn't the only selling point for Beijing's new fans.  Just as crises around fake news and online disinformation have made it easier for China to push its model of internet sovereignty -- one that has been happily embraced by those governments already keen to censor online dissent -- so too has the current pandemic provided an opportunity and an excuse to pursue the type of authoritarian power exercised by Beijing.  Last month, the Council of Europe warned that Hungary -- long the EU's least democratically inclined member -- risked jeopardizing "democracy, rule of law and human rights" in its coronavirus response. States across the Middle East have used the virus as an opportunity to ramp up surveillance and controls on their populations, while in the Philippines, a group of lawyers has warned that emergency powers granted to President Rodrigo Duterte are "tantamount to autocracy."  But for those pushing these changes, China could be perceived to be a strong argument that an empowered state is what is needed to respond to the pandemic. Regardless of the many valid criticisms of how Beijing initially handled the crisis, it appears to have been able to get its domestic epidemic under control and the economy back on track better than many other countries.  The US government, meanwhile, presents something of an uneasy contrast: with a President musing about whether ingesting disinfectants could be used to treat the virus and encouraging protesters to demand an end to quarantine measures.  Of course, the US is not the only model of a democracy, and the American system is actually something of an outlier compared to much of the developed world. Nor have other democracies struggled to cope with the virus in the same way: many of the governments praised for their handling of the virus -- Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Germany -- are democracies. It is how a government uses power, not how it has it in the first place, which appears to be the overriding factor in an effective epidemic response.  But just as "communist" China has always been a convenient specter for those railing against left-wing policies or a strong government in the West, so too is "democratic" US a handy foil for opponents of liberalism in China and elsewhere.  Brand China may be suffering as a result of the pandemic, but it is not the only one. Beijing also appears to have a greater appreciation than most of its rivals of the potential opportunities presented by the current crisis to emerge stronger and more influential than ever before.

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) Given the economic devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic, we need to start developing a plan to bring people out of lockdown. With so many people out of work and businesses temporarily closed, many aspects of life have come to a grinding halt. The sooner people can safely return to normal life, the sooner we can start the economic recovery. In order to do that, we must be able to proceed knowing that those who are allowed to emerge are no longer at risk of catching or spreading Covid-19.  While the WHO said on Friday that "There is no evidence yet that people who have had Covid-19 will not get a second infection," based on what we know about immunology, there is reason to assume that recovering from the virus will provide some amount of immunity.  The key is to further develop our antibody tests to better understand who is immune to the virus and conduct research to determine how long this immunity might last. Then, we should provide credentials to those who are immune -- through a Covid-19 immunity passport -- so that those individuals can resume their lives.  In China, for example, QR codes have been used to loosen restrictions in Wuhan, where the pandemic originated. People assessed to be healthy have been given a green QR code, indicating they can travel within the province. (A yellow code indicates a person may have come in contact with an infected person, while red is for those who have been diagnosed or are suspected to have the virus.)  Since the beginning of the pandemic's outbreak, we have assumed that a social distancing public health strategy -- or what I prefer to call, "physical distancing" -- would be effective at reducing the spread of contagion. However, in order to work and produce the best results, distancing must be done by populations -- preferably globally, but at least nationally -- consistently, with widespread participation.  Some nations are taking a more aggressive approach. India, with a population of over 1.3 billion , is currently in the midst of a lockdown that will last until at least May 3 , though limited employees have been allowed to return to work with strict hygiene guidelines.  South Africa has also chosen this draconian lockdown method for the entire country, as practiced in Wuhan, though this week it plans to lift some restrictions and implement a curfew.  The majority of states in the US have also implemented orders to stay at home.  When large numbers of people are out of work due to the lockdown, it takes an inevitable toll on personal finances, not to mention the global economy. Since March 14, around 26.5 million Americans -- about 16.2% of the labor force -- have filed for unemployment.  But with a Covid-19 passport, those who do not pose a risk of spreading or catching the virus can move freely, get back to their jobs and help kickstart the economy.  We have long known from other diseases, such as hepatitis and even the common cold, that your body can protect you from contracting a disease that you've already had by producing antibodies. These are proteins manufactured by the immune system in response to a foreigner or an unwelcome visitor such as Covid-19. The body tries to attack and fight off the infection. Once these antibodies are produced, they remain in the body even after the virus is gone and the theory is that it can create a state of immunity, which can hopefully ward off the same infection should it present itself again down the road.  With certain pathogens, just one exposure will cause the body's immune system to wipe it out forever, as in the case of chickenpox and polio. However, for the family of coronaviruses that can cause a variety of colds, our bodies can form an immunity that can last just a couple of months, to a few years. This is why we can get colds frequently.  We don't yet fully understand the reason behind varying immunities and, as Covid-19 is new to us, we are not sure how long immunity could last. At this point, we can assume that once infected and recovered, our bodies most likely have immunity for some period of time. The whole concept of vaccines relies on this theory. We expose our bodies to a tiny portion of the pathogen, or a molecule that is similar to the pathogen, and stimulate our immune system to form antibodies.  There is some data that casts doubt on this assumption , however. Some patients in South Korea, who got the infection tested positive again after recovery. As the Wall Street Journal reported , South Korean doctors believe that these cases were not a reinfection, but rather a reactivation of the initial virus. But clearly, more research is needed to understand Covid-19 immunity before we can start opening society back up with confidence.  There is also the popular concern that new strains of the virus could arise in the community. But this is little cause for concern, as mutations are natural, common and in many cases do not pose additional danger to humans. A mutation could, for instance, pose a greater threat to the survival of the virus itself.  Tests that check for viral immunity, if created precisely and accurately, can identify just what type of protection recovered individuals will have. This can be done by looking at "immunoglobulins" or specific antibodies called IgM and IgG . IgM tends to indicate short-term protection while IgG suggests longer-term protection.  Currently there are quite a few companies working on the antibody tests , but the results so far have not been promising. Their accuracy leaves much to be desired; some have falsely identified antibodies of Covid-19 cousins from the same family of Coronavirus, like the virus that causes the common colds and SARS. And as Covid-19 tests have become more readily available, some health officials have complained about their poor quality . However, if the US can develop adequate testing, and if Covid-19 behaves like other viruses in the same family, we should be able to confirm that we are immune, once infected and recovered. For how long remains to be determined -- and the expiration date of the immunity passport would need to be assessed once we have more information on the longevity on the antibodies.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  With these tests, we would be armed with knowledge that could allow us to more pragmatically protect those who are sick or vulnerable to coronavirus while allowing those now immune to the disease to get back to normal life. The tests could be a critical resource for determining if health care workers and loved ones are immune and therefore safe to treat and care for Covid-19 patients without the risk of contracting the disease themselves. Travel could begin safely around the globe, as well, which would be very good for both the nation and the world.  We are still a ways from the vaccine, which will probably prove to be the answer to this pandemic once and for all. However, an accurate Covid-19 immunity test could prove to be a game changer as well, short of the vaccine. Let's hope a reliable antibody test is developed soon and can send people back to work and out in the world, safely.
2020-04-28	Experts predicted that the country could expect millions of coronavirus cases. Doctors warned that India needed to prepare for an onslaught of cases that could cripple the country's ill-equipped health system. Onlookers worried that the virus could spread like wildfire through India's slums, where residents live in cramped quarters and basic sanitation often isn't available.  But so far, the world's second-most populous country appears to have avoided the worst.  As of Tuesday, India had reported 31,360 coronavirus cases and 1,008 deaths, or about 0.76 deaths per million. Compare that to the United States , where the number of deaths per million is more than 175.  Some experts say that India's relatively positive numbers suggest the country's nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 could be working -- for now.  A senior citizen watches Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi address the nation on a television broadcast during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown on April 14, 2020.  "India didn't wait for the problem to escalate," India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on April 14, as he extended the country's 21-day nationwide lockdown until May 3. "Instead, as soon as the problem appeared, we tried to stop it by making swift decisions. I can't imagine what the situation would have been had such quick decisions not been taken."  But the reality behind India's numbers is more complicated -- and experts caution that it is too early for India to congratulate itself.  "At least in this round, it appears that the virus has not been able to damage as much as been feared," Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a nonprofit that works on training, research and policy development. "I don't think we can say that we have completely closed the book on this."  How swift were Modi's decisions?  On March 24, Modi announced that the country was going into a three-week lockdown.  The scale of it was unprecedented. India has a population of 1.3 billion, and the only country with a bigger population -- China -- had imposed citywide lockdowns, but never a nationwide one.  It was a high-stakes decision. Going into lockdown meant millions of daily-wage workers would be deprived of an income. But not imposing a lockdown risked overwhelming India's health care system. One model estimated that without social distancing measures, about 150 million people in India would be infected by June. On Friday, India's top pandemic official said that the country would have had more than 100,000 cases by now if it weren't for the lockdown.  India moved into lockdown relatively quickly -- it was announced when the country had reported 519 coronavirus cases  By comparison, Italy waited until it had more than 9,200 coronavirus cases before it went into a nationwide lockdown, while the United Kingdom had about 6,700.  Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, a non-profit research organization with offices in Washington, D.C., and New Delhi, said the decision to impose a lockdown promptly, even when case numbers was low, had likely reduced contact rates significantly.  restrictions left them without jobs. That prompted fears that the migrants could spread the virus, with some officials in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh even Following the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers attempted to leave India's major cities after therestrictionsleft them without jobs. That prompted fears that the migrants could spread the virus, with some officials in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh even spraying returning workers with disinfectant -- an ineffective approach to controlling coronavirus.  Around a week after the lockdown began, two people had died from coronavirus in Mumbai's densely packed slums. Following the second death, several of the man's family members had been tested and placed under home quarantine , and the block of 300 homes and 90 shops that make up his neighborhood have been sealed off.  By the time the lockdown was imposed, India had already taken other measures.  On March 11, India suspended all tourist visas, and announced that all travelers who had been in the most-affected areas of the world in the past few weeks would be quarantined for at least 14 days. From March 22, all international commercial flights were banned from landing in India and all passenger train services in the country were suspended.  The United States, by comparison, has restricted foreigners traveling from China, Iran, and certain European countries, but there is no blanket ban on foreigners entering the country.  What if the numbers aren't right?  As with every country, our understanding of the outbreak is only as good as the numbers we have available. And that depends on testing.  According to India's Health Ministry, the country has conducted more than 625,000 tests as of Sunday -- more than South Korea , which has been praised for its approach to testing.  When public health experts are assessing how aggressively a country is testing, they don't look at the total numbers alone -- instead, they often look at the country's test positivity rate. If a large proportion of the tests are coming back positive, that suggests that only the most serious cases -- such as those in hospital -- are being tested.  According to Mike Ryan , the executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programs, a good benchmark is to have at least 10 negative cases for every positive one.  , based on government data. Around 4% of India's tests are positive, according to data from India's Health Ministry -- well below that benchmark. It's also a significantly lower rate than the US, where the rate is about 17%, according to data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). It's also lower than the UK, where the rate is around 21% based on government data.  Another useful measure is the proportion of cases that are fatal. In India, about 3% of cases have died, compared with more than 13% in Italy, the UK and France, according to JHU . That suggests that India is testing people besides those with the most serious symptoms.  But India's testing rate is extremely low per capita. Only about 48 out of every 100,000 people have been tested, compared with around 1,175 in South Korea and 1,740 in the US.  A sample tube at a Covid-19 coronavirus testing drive inside the Dharavi slums during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown in Mumbai on April 16, 2020.  Samir Saran, the president of the Observer Research Foundation, says India has ramped up its testing capabilities dramatically -- but he's still not happy with the numbers. While other experts say that widespread community testing would be impractical and a waste of resources, Saran says that's something India needs to look at, given it has large swathes of the population who travel between regions for work.  While India may not be testing enough, Reddy says, doctors are probably catching most of the moderate and serious cases. If there was a huge surge in Covid-19 cases that weren't being caught by testing, then hospitals would be crowded with cases and there would be a spike in influenza-like symptoms in the community, he said.  For now, there's no indication of either. However, there is a growing body of evidence that Covid-10 causes symptoms far beyond influenza-like symptoms  Could more people be dying than we know?  Even when India isn't facing a pandemic, only about 22% of all registered deaths are medically certified. That means that, in the majority of deaths, the official cause of death has not been certified by a doctor.  And there's already evidence that some deaths may be flying under the radar. A resident doctor at one of the main government hospitals in Mumbai said last week that when dead bodies were brought into the hospital, they didn't test them for coronavirus, even if they suspected that was how patients died.  "If the personal history shows that the person came in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, we dispose of the body in the same way that we would for Covid-positive patients," said the doctor, who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media.  But, experts say, at this stage, it doesn't look like there is a huge flood of coronavirus deaths.  "Even if we are not testing enough and are not discovering enough, there are not enough bodies being piled up in hospitals or in ICUs or in mortuaries ... to suggest we are in the midst of something really dramatic at this stage," said Saran.  Even so, the true count of Covid-19 deaths will only come much later, when we are able to compare statistics from this year with past years, said CCDEP's Laxminarayan.  When did coronavirus take hold?  India's swift policy measures only tell part of the story. Even before India's lockdown, coronavirus was present in the country, the country had reported some coronavirus cases, but not many.  On January 30, India reported its first case -- a student who had been studying at Wuhan University in China.  It was around the same time that the UK, France, and Italy also reported their first cases, although their coronavirus outbreaks followed dramatically different trajectories. All three countries now have well over 100,000 coronavirus cases.  A worker arranges beds for a quarantine centre in Guwahati on March 29, 2020.  Experts still aren't sure why the virus would have shown a different pattern of spread in India.  One possible reason, said Reddy, is that coronavirus may thrive in colder conditions, meaning that it might not spread so efficiently in India, where temperatures are often more than 30 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Farenheit).  But scientific evidence so far contradicts this idea. The World Health Organization says the evidence so far shows the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather. The US's National Academy of Sciences committee said the data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather.  Another possibility, Reddy said, is that India's population may be less susceptible due to the country's policy of universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG -- which was developed to fight tuberculosis -- is being studied in clinical trials around the world as a possible way to fight the novel coronavirus.  Police personnel wearing coronavirus-themed helmets ride on horses as they participate in a awareness campaign in Secunderabad, the twin city of Hyderabad, on April 2, 2020.  However, the WHO notes that there is no evidence that the BCG vaccine protects people against infection from coronavirus, and the WHO does not recommend the vaccine as a prevention against Covid-19.  But for now, more evidence is needed. "We do not know what is the factor that has helped us," Reddy said.  Will a 40-day lockdown be enough?  Even if India's outbreak is comparatively small, it's not yet time for celebration.  There's a huge diversity of opinion about what will happen when India lifts its lockdown on May 3 -- whether cases will then skyrocket, or if the lockdown will have succeeded in restraining numbers.  "A surge is going to happen ... as soon as we go back from the nationwide lockdown. That is my hunch," said Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. "India has successfully hit a pause button. But the problem now is we cannot be on pause forever."  A drone used by police to monitor activities of people and spread awareness announcements in Chennai on April 4, 2020.  The determining factor will likely be what restrictions are still in place when the lockdown lifts. As Reddy put it: "It's not as though tomorrow we declare victory and then we get back to normal."  Experts say that social distancing will need to be maintained, although some states with fewer cases may be able to ease restrictions. Uttar Pradesh -- India's most populous state with 200 million residents -- has extended a ban on public gatherings until the end of June.  Laxminarayan warned that if social distancing and hygiene measures "are not taken seriously, we will have a serious issue that the health system is not equipped to handle."  One thing that won't work in India is an age-specific lockdown, where elderly stay inside and the young are allowed to go back to work. Around the world, the elderly have been at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus -- in the US, 80% of deaths have been those ages 65 or older  A stray dog walks in front of an empty historic India Gate on March 30, 2020 in New Delhi, India.  India has a relatively young population -- 44% of the population are 24 or younger, compared with 23% in Italy and 29% in China, according to data from the CIA World Factbook. But many Indians live in a three-generation household, meaning that there is significant contact between younger and older generations, said University of Cambridge mathematician Ronojoy Adhikari, who modeled India's outbreak.  "This makes the elderly in India particularly vulnerable, as they are far more likely to catch the infection from the second and third generations, on whom the infection will, statistically speaking, only have mild effects," he said.  Even if India does manage to avoid the worst of the virus this time around, there's plenty to be done. The government needs to be working to support the country's informal workforce, who are "underwriting the cost of the lockdown," as Saran puts it. The government needs to strengthen the public health system to prepare for a possible return and resurgence in the winter, said Reddy.  "This is not a one month challenge, this is going to be a 12-month challenge," said Saran. "I think this is a good 18-month examination of how we respond as people, communities, countries, states."
2020-04-29	Ulrich Perrey/Pool/AFP/Getty Images  One of the first carefully done studies of the antiviral drug remdesivir shows it did not help people recover faster from coronavirus infections. But the study, conducted in China, may have been too small to show clearly whether the drug helps.  The findings of the Chinese study conflict with other hints of the drug’s efficacy coming from other trials – two of them also on Wednesday. One study was from the company that makes the drug and a third study from the National Institutes of Health is expected later on Wednesday.  Experts say it’s going to take a lot more testing and a little longer before it’s clear whether remdesivir can help patients recover from Covid-19 infections.  The study conducted in China was stopped early because there weren’t enough patients, but it indicated that the drug did not work as hoped, the team reported in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday. Some details of this study were posted last week on the World Health Organization’s website, then removed.  Gilead said earlier on Wednesday that its own study of the drug showed it may work and that patients who took the drug for five days or 10 days saw similar results. Gilead’s study results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The study done in China was more carefully designed than Gilead’s study to show whether the drug was helping patients.  The Lancet study was a randomized, placebo controlled study – meaning that patients were randomly given the drug or a dummy treatment and the patients and doctors did not know who was getting what.  The team at China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China tested the drug using 237 coronavirus patients in Wuhan.  “Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” Bin Cao, the researcher who led the study, said in a statement.  “Future studies need to determine whether earlier treatment with remdesivir, higher doses, or combination with other antivirals or SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, might be more effective in those with severe illness,” he added.  The study may not tell anything meaningful. Larger studies enrolling more people, and conducted with careful controls will be needed to tell whether various treatments work.  “The study was well designed—a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter randomized trial—and well conducted, with high protocol adherence and no loss-to-follow up,” John Norrie of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary.  “We eagerly await the ongoing trials.”
2020-04-29	(CNN) A return for sports would be a return to some semblance of normalcy. But don't hold your breath.  With thousands of new cases being reported across the country every day, experts say we may have to brace for a year in which we may not see many of our favorite athletes suit up and take their respective fields, rinks or tracks.  And while sports commissioners have said they are actively exploring options to safely resume play, most of it is likely conjecture -- no one really knows when it'll be safe to begin play again.  The only game is wait and see.  Take it from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Donald Trump's Covid-19 task force.  "I would love to be able to have all sports back," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with the New York Times published on Wednesday. "But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we're not ready for that yet."  "Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything," the doctor added. "If you can't guarantee safety, then unfortunately you're going to have to bite the bullet and say, 'We may have to go without this sport for this season.'"  But some sports, such as golf, are already eying a return -- the LPGA announced that it is hopeful it could restart the 2020 LPGA tour in mid-July . However, a non-contact sport where athletes compete individually, social distancing guidelines and safety measures is much easier to implement than, say, basketball.  Who could forget March 11th, when an announcer called off the Oklahoma City Thunder and Utah Jazz game just before tip-off, signaling the arrival of the coronavirus in the US to many.  For team sports where contact is unavoidable, leagues will have to take extra precautions in order to ensure the safety of players and personnel.  Widespread, rapid testing needed  First and foremost, teams will have to be able to conduct widespread, rapid testing of players and personnel in order for resuming play to become even remotely possible, experts say.  "I hope when we get to that point, when we're going to try and get the sports figures tested, then we will have enough tests so that anybody who needs a test can get a test," Fauci told the NYT.  "That's the reason I stress the idea of testing everybody and having available for them tests from which you can get a result immediately," Fauci said. "And then you'll know whether or not someone is infected and have to get them out for a while, 14 days or whatever it is until they pass the incubation period."  Isolating players who test positive and preventing them from participating is vital for any plan to work. But until testing is easily accessible for the general public, some may say it simply isn't fair for sports leagues to get priority just because these leagues have deeper pockets.  Playing in empty stadiums with no spectators  The safety of all personnel and fans is of the utmost importance. That means any league entertaining the idea of resuming play will likely be playing without anyone in the stands. In fact, spectator-less sports may become the new normal.  Stadiums will be empty to limit the potential spread of the virus, and it could be some time before spectators are allowed to attend games in person.  Some leagues may even have to delay live broadcasts of games or get creative with the audio during games without spectators, as the noise from the crowd often drowns out what is said on the court or field during a game.  Korean Baseball Organization is leading the way  The Korean Baseball Organization, which announced that it will begin its season on May 5, may help show the world the way.  While South Korea reported its first coronavirus case on January 20 , the country deployed rapid testing that helped keep the spread low and is now reporting less than 100 new cases every day.  Social distancing measures are set to begin lifting across the country next week. The league will begin the season without spectators with the hope of gradually increasing attendance throughout the season, according to NBC Sports  Team managers will be available for a pregame press conference, but all managers, team officials and media members must wear masks. There will no longer be any pregame media scrums in the dugout, and only a single player or manager from the winning team will be available to the media after a game.  Each team has also put into place a daily protocol for entering team facilities -- there's just one entrance for people to enter and everyone that enters the facility has to have their temperature taken.  Sports leagues across the globe are likely to be closely monitoring how the season goes.
2020-04-29	After a pained and somewhat public debate over discontinuing the daily White House coronavirus briefings, President Donald Trump this week has attempted to bridge the gap between the wishes of his advisers and his own inclinations by moving the event elsewhere.  Instead of the blue-hued James S. Brady Briefing Room -- where the last time he took questions he found himself veering into bleach and sunlight peril -- Trump has convened with reporters each day this week in other venues: the Oval Office, the East Room, the State Dining Room and the Rose Garden.  With a more limited crowd and -- with the help of visiting governors and executives -- a narrower focus, Trump and his aides hope to avoid the devolving spectacle they saw the previous briefings becoming.  The shift had been weeks in the making as advisers gently warned the President that the briefings were hurting , not helping him. But it wasn't until a Friday afternoon breaking point -- after close to 24 hours of negative coverage of his remarks about disinfectants -- that a change was made.  Some still remain wary that Trump can regain his stature after attempting to blanket the airwaves with his daily updates. So far this week, Trump's events have largely avoided the combativeness and grievance-airing that had become the signature feature of his briefing room appearances. But it's only Day 3.  Initially conceived as a venue to harness a rapt public and convey a sense of executive authority, the daily briefings from the White House press room had become an internal flash point for an administration struggling to contain the pandemic.  Trump had barely set foot in the room before February 27, when he walked out to deliver a statement and take questions about the growing outbreak. By mid-March, the event had become a daily occurrence, moved into the early evening at Trump's insistence to capture more viewers. He told aides he appreciated the sense of authority the briefing room imparted, and bragged about getting better ratings than anyone else sharing his stage.  But as time went on, Trump -- whose tone in the briefings veered wildly from day to day and even within single sessions -- found himself looking less like an even-keeled wartime leader and more like the mercurial brawler he'd never really attempted to suppress after becoming president.  That was a problem for Trump's political advisers, some of whom had been cautioning him for weeks against continuing the daily sessions, which they believed were eroding his approval ratings.  Last Wednesday, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale and several other top political advisers briefed him on internal campaign and Republican National Committee data showing the President was heading for defeat in key battleground states. Parscale, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and other advisers urged him to scale back his daily news conferences, pointing to data showing they were hurting him with critical swing voters.  Trump wasn't convinced, people familiar with the matter said, pointing instead to other factors like his reduced travel schedule and negative media coverage.  A day later, the disinfectant episode unfolded -- a briefing room nadir for the President, who spent the next several days fuming about how the incident was covered and, in a phone call first reported by CNN , berating Parscale for his political predicament.  The episode also led to a contentious senior staff meeting Friday morning, where West Wing aides faulted the vice president's office for inviting a senior Department of Homeland Security official to the briefing without running his presentation by the rest of the team first. The official had presented at the task force meeting the day before, though Trump was not there.  By the time the week had ended, word emerged of a new strategy that did not include daily press briefings but did involve a renewed focus on the economy, an area some White House aides believed would come more naturally for Trump.  How willing the President was to adopt to new plan remained an open question, even for close aides. Trump does not like the appearance of being managed, and stories at the end of the week depicted the change as mostly driven by worried political advisers.  Still, the President appeared to have bought into the new plan, or at least some iteration of it.  "What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately," Trump tweeted over the weekend. "They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!"  After going weeks with daily press briefings even on weekends -- including days when aides presumed there would be none -- Saturday and Sunday passed without question-and-answer sessions.  Aides began laying plans for more narrowly focused events at the White House, including a speech Thursday focused on senior citizens. And as states begin lifting their stay-at-home orders, Trump initiated daily in-person meetings with governors, including the leaders of Florida, Louisiana and New Jersey.  The goal, according to officials, was to more sharply define the day's message in the hopes of avoiding the amorphous nature of the briefings.  But as the week began, some confusion over the new state of play was evident. The President's schedule for Monday was released listing a briefing for the usual time in the afternoon. In the morning, aides said that was a mistake, and the President's new press secretary told reporters there would be no briefing.  But a few hours later, the plans had changed again. "UPDATE," press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wrote. "The White House has additional testing guidance and other announcements about safely opening up America again. President @realDonaldTrump will brief the nation."  And so he did, from the Rose Garden, where he allowed a parade of retail executives speak before eventually taking questions about the testing strategy he'd just unveiled.  JUST WATCHED Trump tries to backtrack on testing claim. See what really happened. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tries to backtrack on testing claim. See what really happened. 03:09  Trump had been irked by emerging news reports that he was halting the briefings because of the fallout from his remarks about disinfectants. He instructed aides to not say he has stopped doing briefings.  "This has been an opportunity to speak directly to the American people. We think they've been great," McEnany said following an appearance on Fox News on Monday. Future briefings, she said "might have a new look to them, a new focus to them," declining to provide further details  On Tuesday, Trump's schedule didn't include a briefing. But by mid-morning it seemed like the plans had changed again when McEnany tweeted Trump would hold a news conference with the visiting Republican governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.  It turns out Trump was merely planning to take questions from reporters alongside DeSantis in the Oval Office, which he does frequently when hosting foreign officials or other dignitaries.  Seated in his yellow armchair, Trump grew testy at moments, including when a reporter from Yahoo News pressed him on the state of testing in the United States compared to other countries.  Trump deferred to Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, who later produced figures showing the US testing more people per capita than South Korea.  "Just check it again," Birx told the reporter politely.  Trump was less forgiving.  "You ought to get your facts right," he snapped.  On Wednesday, as Trump surveyed the clutch of reporters who'd come to listen to him meet with industry executives, he seemed in a better mood.  "These are the most wonderful human beings," he said sarcastically, before deciding he approved of the faces he saw. "Actually, this is a nice group. I can't imagine, we actually have a nice group of people."  How Trump proceeds with his press interactions remains to be seen. But with travel to Arizona outlooked, next week promises the return of a Trump-era hallmark: the South Lawn "chopper talk," where presidential fury and authority alike are dampened by a helicopter engine's roar.
2020-04-30	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump did not hold an official coronavirus briefing on Thursday. Instead, he took questions from reporters after a White House event about protecting seniors -- and, as he did at the official briefings, made a bunch of false and misleading claims.  Asked about his previous compliments for China's response to the virus, Trump falsely suggested that the compliments had all come before the virus arrived in the US and before he had finalized a trade deal with China. And he dubiously suggested that he had quickly solved coronavirus testing problems, though many public health experts say he was slow to react and that the country is still far from a sufficient number of tests.  Trump repeated some old favorite inaccuracies about his travel restrictions on China and Europe (they weren't full bans), trade with China (it's not true that the US had never previously received any money from China) and the Veterans Choice health care program (President Barack Obama, not Trump, signed it into law).  Trump also made a subjective claim that the US's per capita coronavirus death numbers are "very strong." The US does not have the worst numbers in the world, but it has done far worse than some other countries -- including South Korea, which had its first confirmed case right around the same time in January.  The testing problem  Trump claimed again that South Korean President Moon Jae-in had called him to compliment the administration's work on coronavirus testing and then said, "The testing and the masks and all of the things: We've solved every problem. We solved it quickly." Moon's administration told CNN that it would not discuss the contents of their conversations.  Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made clear that it is not a certainty that even this timeline will be met. He said: "That's what I'm being told by the people who are responsible for the testing. I take them for their word. If that doesn't happen, I'm going to go to them and say, 'What happened here, why didn't it happen and how can we fix it?' "  Trump's compliments for China  When CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta asked Trump about the fact that he had previously been complimentary of China's response to the virus and asked Trump what has changed since then, Trump invoked his trade negotiations with China.  During the negotiations, Trump said, he was complimentary of China, though he was also sometimes not. But after he made the deal, he continued, "All of a sudden, we heard there's a virus, and a virus is coming in. That changes my mind very greatly. That's a whole different thing."  When another reporter followed up later in the event, Trump said, "Well, I'm making a trade deal with China. This was before the virus -- of course I'm going to be complimentary." He said that "the bottom line is, we ended up making a deal before the virus came, and I was very happy with the deal, but then later on, that was superseded by a virus that should not have happened."  Facts First: Trump's timeline was inaccurate. The President continued to compliment China's response to the virus after he signed the trade agreement on Trump's timeline was inaccurate. The President continued to compliment China's response to the virus after he signed the trade agreement on January 15 , after the presence of the virus in the United States was confirmed on January 21 and after the agreement took effect on February 14  For example, speaking to reporters on February 18, Trump said, "I think President Xi is working very hard" and "doing it very professionally." Asked if he trusted data coming from China, Trump praised Xi Jinping again: "Look, I know this: President Xi loves the people of China, he loves his country and he's doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation."  Speaking to reporters on February 23, Trump was asked if Xi should be doing anything differently in his handling of the crisis. He responded: "No, I think President Xi is working very, very hard. I spoke to him. He's working very hard. I think he's doing a very good job. It's a big problem. But President Xi loves his country. He's working very hard to solve the problem, and he will solve the problem. OK?"  You can read more here about Trump's previous praise of China and Xi over the virus.  Death totals  Trump asserted that compared with other countries, the US has a "very strong" number of coronavirus deaths per million people.  "Our death totals, our numbers, per million people, are really very, very strong. We're very proud of the job we've done," the President said.  Facts First: The US has 192 reported coronavirus deaths per million as of Thursday evening. While that's not the most recorded coronavirus deaths per million, it also not the least. Countries including Belgium, Spain and Italy have had more deaths as a percentage of population, while countries including South Korea, which had its first confirmed case around the same time as the US, have had far fewer. (It's important to note that there are questions about the accuracy of figures from countries around the world, both because of suspicions of data manipulation by countries like China and because early death counts are imprecise.)  Based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, other countries, such as Belgium, Spain and Italy, have reported more coronavirus-related deaths per million compared with the US figure of 192 reported coronavirus deaths per million.  As The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler first pointed out , South Korea and the US both had their first reported cases of coronavirus in mid-January. But the US has recorded 192 people dead per million people, while South Korea has recorded fewer than five per million. And Singapore , which has seen cases spike this month, has 2.5 deaths per million. Australia has had 4 deaths per million.  It's important to note that coronavirus deaths in other countries have sometimes been adjusted, and some experts have questioned whether certain countries, notably China, are recording accurate death tolls. Earlier this month, China revised its official death toll from the coronavirus, raising the number of fatalities attributed to the pandemic by more than a third.  And a Wall Street Journal report published earlier this month highlighted concerns about the official death count in Italy, another country hit hard by the coronavirus. The country's count might not have included additional coronavirus deaths among groups that were never tested.  Travel restrictions on China and Europe  Trump once again said his administration put a "ban" on China and Europe, using the travel policies as his primary defense against criticism of his response to the pandemic.  "As you know, very early on in January, we put the ban on in China," he said Thursday, before adding, "Then we later put the ban on in Europe."  Facts First: Trump's characterization of these travel restrictions as a "ban" is misleading because both policies contained multiple exemptions, including for US citizens and permanent residents; the Europe policy exempted entire countries. Only foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe's Schengen area, the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the US. And while the travel restrictions on China were announced at the end of January, the regulations did not go into effect until February 2.  You can read more about the travel restrictions here  Tariff revenue and China  Touting his trade policy with China, Trump repeated a regular false claim that until he took office, "China never gave our country anything. China gave us nothing. Not 10 cents."  Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans, not China, are paying most of the cost of Trump's tariffs. Aside from that, it's not true that the Treasury had never previously received "10 cents" or had gotten "nothing" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries. FactCheck.org Study after study has shown that Americans, not China, are paying most of the cost of Trump's tariffs. Aside from that, it's not true that the Treasury had never previously received "10 cents" or had gotten "nothing" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries. FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an "average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb."  Trump was also wrong if he was talking broadly about Chinese spending on American products. China purchased more than $100 billion worth of American exports from 2011 to 2016 , and billions per year dating back to at least 1985.  Veterans Choice  Discussing efforts to help veterans and senior citizens, Trump again claimed credit for the passage of the Veterans Choice health care program.  With Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie in the audience, the President said: "And we are being helped very greatly by the passage of all the things that we got passed, Robert, especially Choice, so that people can go and see their doctor when they have to and especially our seniors."
2020-04-30	Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN) The most complicated issue in America right now is how, when and where to reopen the cities and towns that have been sheltered in place. Everyone wants resumption of the mobile life of social proximity we enjoyed a few months ago but balancing this against the competing need to assure both individual safety and -- because this is a contagious disease -- societal safety remains a substantial challenge.  Fortunately, a new study from South Korea has just been published in "early release" form (it is final and peer-reviewed, just early) in the CDC medical journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Titled "Coronavirus Disease Outbreak in Call Center, South Korea," it describes how South Korea dealt with an outbreak in a high-rise building in the busiest part of Seoul with an early, decisive intervention that included closing the entire building, extensive testing and quarantine of infected people and their contacts. The study was conducted by experts from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Seoul Metropolitan Government and other local institutions.  Though a one-building solution, the authors' approach to identification and control of Covid-19 can serve as a blueprint for local and national policymakers wrestling with how best to proceed.  The outbreak was first recognized on March 8, 2020, approximately two weeks after South Korea found itself in the throes of a substantial national epidemic that arose from exposures at the Shincheonji Church in the city of Daegu, about 150 miles south of Seoul. About half of South Korea's current toll of 10,738 confirmed cases are related to the Shincheonji Church outbreak.  Informed by previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS, South Korean health officials had a mature process for containment already in place when the first call center case was identified. A response team immediately undertook review of the site of the infections -- a 19-story mixed commercial-residential building.  On March 9, one day after the first cases were reported, the entire building was closed. Testing was performed almost immediately on 1,143 people (workers, residents and a few visitors) with rapid results available to those affected and the team working to control the situation.  The testing showed that 97 people (8.5% of those occupying the building) were infected. Most of the cases were women in their 30s and almost all (94 of the 97) worked on the 11th floor of the building, in the call center.  Curiously, unlike many outbreaks reported before and since, virtually all of those infected -- 92% of cases -- had active Covid-19 symptoms at the time of diagnosis.  Investigators then constructed a detailed map of who was and was not infected, demonstrating that the overwhelming majority of cases had worked on one side of the 11th floor in extremely close proximity. Overall, 43% of all workers on the 11th floor developed infection with an even higher proportion among those in the heavily affected wing.  Next, the South Korean team tested the families and housemates of the 97 people with infection. Of these, about 16% were positive for Covid-19. Very surprisingly, no cases were diagnosed in the 15 home contacts of cases with "pre-symptoms" (nothing at time of test but development soon thereafter) or no symptoms at any time. This also goes against the current thinking on transmission, which is that it occurs even before people show symptoms.  In their discussion, the South Korean investigators reflected on the effect their work could have for business-as-usual in Seoul. They point out that the cases were in a "high-density work environment" and that spread was largely limited to one section of one floor.  But they fail to give themselves credit for what they accomplished. Yes, the distance between chairs and the duration of exposure are critical determinants of transmission at a single point in time -- but allowing undiagnosed persons to unwittingly go about their business increases the opportunity for more and more uninfected people to have close and sustained contact with them, possibly leading to a secondary case.  Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Had the investigators waited a week, the infection would likely have spread widely to family, then to friends, then to friends' workplaces -- just as we are seeing in the outbreaks in US meat processing plants with a comparably high-density work environment. The virus knows no walls: Once a business is infected, the entire community may quickly become infected, unless dramatic action -- such as occurred in Seoul -- is taken.  The current notion of some American public officials of simply reopening our cities and towns -- like a department store grand opening that goes from nothing to a complete full-service store overnight -- surely is a pipe-dream. But this report from South Korea shows us how we actually can handle the uncertain business of resuming a normal-ish life.  To do so will require decisiveness such as quickly closing an entire building if needed, widely available testing with rapid results, and citizens willing to be quarantined as needed for the public good.  Only by adopting this blueprint in its entirety can the vision of returning to a vibrant free-swinging nation be achieved. Trying to sneak back by ignoring the problem -- a pandemic that has killed more than 60,000 Americans in two months -- or by hoping that maybe it will go away if we eat this or drink that or don't spend so much time worrying -- will not only fail miserably, it will move us immediately back to the terrifying first weeks of March, when the sky actually felt like it was falling.
2020-04-30	Health Secretary Matt Hancock asserted on Friday that it had met a headline-grabbing aim of conducting 100,000 daily Covid-19 tests by the end of April. The figure was 122,347, he said -- although officials conceded that 40,369 of those were sent to people's homes or to satellite testing centers, and had not necessarily been processed by labs.  The government argued, with some justification, that the huge expansion in testing capacity -- up from 10,000 a day at the beginning of April -- was a huge achievement.  But the fact that the target was needed at all, critics say, only served to illustrate the inadequacies of Britain's testing regime in the first place.  Whether the target was hit or missed, there are other failings. The UK is on track to have one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in Europe, with more than 26,000 deaths recorded by Wednesday. Its patchwork of care homes for the elderly has been ravaged by the disease. There have been near-daily reports of insufficient personal protective equipment on the front line, meaning doctors, nurses and care home workers risk catching it every time they go to work.  The country's leader himself contracted the disease, becoming so ill that his advisers were not completely sure that he would recover from it. At the time, daily briefings breezily proclaimed Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in "good spirits" when in fact -- by Johnson's own account later -- the situation was significantly more grave.  Boris Johnson, center, is flanked by the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, left, and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance at a March 12 news conference.  And, despite ministers' repeated insistence that they are being "guided by the science" in their coronavirus response, secrecy still shrouds the nature of that scientific advice. The current membership of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies ( SAGE ), the government's main scientific advisory body, which changes depending on the crisis, has not been listed publicly. The group hasn't published the basis of any of its advice for more than a month. There is, as yet, no published framework for exiting the lockdown that has brought the fifth largest economy in the world to a grinding halt.  So far, the government appears to have successfully batted away suggestions that its coronavirus strategy has been a failure by pointing to one, crucial measure of success: The country's beloved National Health Service (NHS) has so far ridden out the crisis without being overwhelmed. The desperate scenes witnessed in northern Italy, where a world-class health system was brought to its knees , have not been repeated in the UK.  "This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice," a government spokesperson told CNN, in response to a request to address the criticisms raised in this article. Ministers and officials have been "working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives," the spokesperson said. "We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, [and] made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it."  But could more have been done to prevent the scale of loss of life? Should ministers have acted sooner? And could there be more transparency in the overall strategy?  A crucial date  Historians might look back on March 12 as the most significant date in Britain's coronavirus response. This was the day the UK formally abandoned the "contain" phase -- an attempt to stop the virus in its tracks by tracking every outbreak and tracing its origins; and moved to the "delay" phase -- an effort to "flatten the curve" and prevent the health service from being overloaded.  On that day Johnson stood before journalists , flanked by his scientific and medical advisers, and admitted that "many more families are going to lose loved ones." But he didn't go as far as ordering a lockdown -- that would come over a week later  Ths stands were packed during day four of the Cheltenham Festival on March 13. (Tom Jenkins/Getty Images)  As he spoke, tens of thousands of people gathered at the Cheltenham racecourse for its annual festival, an early fixture in England's social calendar. Was that wise, he was asked? "It is very important that we're guided by the science," Johnson said, using a phrase that was to become a favorite of government ministers. "There is very little epidemiological or medical reason at the moment to ban such events."  Johnson's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, admitted that even people with "really quite mild symptoms" could be contagious. Despite this, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed with Johnson that canceling large events was "not a major way to tackle this epidemic."  Indeed, the next day, Vallance told BBC Radio 4's flagship morning news program, in a now-infamous interview, that a "key" aim would be to "build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission." Government sources have told CNN that herd immunity was never official policy.  On March 23, in a televised address to the nation, Johnson switched course, announcing the most sweeping set of social restrictions in the UK since the end of World War II. By that time, 335 people had died from Covid-19 in the UK. Given the weeks-long gap between initial infection and death, it's clear now that by the time Johnson spoke, coronavirus had taken hold in Britain.  Three key questions  Critics are zeroing in on three key areas as they seek to find out what went wrong in the UK.  First, there was the abandonment of mass testing.  At the start of the outbreak in the UK, public health officials tracked and traced every known case. Ministers have never offered a clear reason for why that policy was abandoned. Was it because the testing capacity had been reached? Was it because the system could not cope with the expected upturn in demand? Was it structural, since the public health system in England has, over the years, gradually been centralized?  "Abandoning testing gave the virus the green light to spread uncontrollably," says the Royal Society of Medicine's Gabriel Scally. "If you don't have access to testing, you won't know that you have an outbreak until a lot of people are ill."  Some in the scientific community say an obsession with central control led officials to set up the testing regime initially in just a few labs, rather than allowing local hospitals to do it themselves.  "Sadly, it seems likely to me that once the government models showed how bad the crisis would be, our testing capacity wouldn't be anywhere near able to cope with the coming surge," a leading microbiologist told CNN on condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions. "God only knows what their thinking was not telling hospitals to get ready. It was a mistake." Downing Street declined to provide an on-the-record explanation to CNN on this issue.  The second crucial question is whether the government failed to order a lockdown early enough.  Even though the government did not know by that March 12 briefing just how many people were infected, Whitty said it was still too early to lock down because "if people go too early, they become very fatigued." If tough restrictions came too early, the theory went, the British public would begin to tire of it just as they were starting to become effective, and demands for them to be lifted would become impossible to resist.  Government sources defended that course of action to CNN, pointing out that some mitigation measures were put in place between March 12 and the full lockdown on March 23, like advising vulnerable groups to stay at home and requiring people with certain symptoms to self-quarantine.  The UK government ordered a full lockdown on March 23. (Victoria Jones/PA/AP)  The third big question is the pursuit of so-called "herd immunity."  "It's not possible to stop everybody getting it," said Vallance at the March 12 briefing. However, the experience of countries like South Korea and Germany, where testing and tracking systems have been significantly more rigorous, and in New Zealand, where lockdown measures were taken at a much earlier stage, suggest that it has been possible to stop quite a large number of people from getting it.  Medical experts both inside and outside the government's circle of trusted advisers have admitted to CNN that they believe the government waited too long to enter lockdown. "Many of the decisions the government has made ignore basic public health science," says Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter. "From abandoning track and trace, to the timing of the lockdown, to providing the correct protective equipment, ignoring basic public health science may have led to more deaths than necessary."  Pankhania believes that despite government claims it has been guided by science at every step, the decision to delay lockdown was likely "governed by economic consideration, rather than public health science."  This conflict between the government's claim that it has followed the science from day one, and some in the scientific community's skepticism as to how good that evidence is, has become a key battlefield between those inside and outside the UK government.  Following the science  One of the most controversial decisions during this crisis has been to keep private the membership of the SAGE, and not to publish minutes of its meetings, in a departure from standard operating procedure for almost all other UK advisory groups. "I don't personally understand why," said Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), a panel that advises SAGE.  This secrecy has led to speculation from prominent members of the public health community about the quality and breadth of evidence that is reaching the top levels of government. "The government's decisions show no characteristics of public health input. I wouldn't be surprised if the public health voice was marginalized both within SAGE and in government," says Scally, of the Royal Society of Medicine.  It's "driving the public health guys mad," said another scientist who has contributed to the UK's National Risk Register, an overview of the potential threats facing the UK.  Signs supporting the National Health Service have been displayed by an artist in east London. (Matt Dunham/AP)  Another criticism of the process has been that the government has at times even sidestepped the normal groups of scientific advisers. "Things are moving so fast that they're rather going direct to the modelers," said Openshaw. "The epidemiological modelers have got a very direct line into government."  However trivial it might seem, disagreements between public health experts and scientific modelers are a significant part of the story. "We're seeing a struggle that has been going on for about 20 years between modelers and epidemiologists," a scientist who advises SAGE told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential government business.  It's no secret that Dominic Cummings, Johnson's top adviser, has a personal interest in scientific modeling. So it's little surprise that public health experts were enraged when the government was forced to admit last week that Cummings had attended SAGE meetings, which are supposed to be independent advisory forums. The government said he attended in order to understand the scientific debate around the virus and its behavior.  JUST WATCHED Boris Johnson grateful after release from hospital Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Boris Johnson grateful after release from hospital 08:37  Multiple members of SAGE and groups that advise it defended their impartiality to CNN. "The debate is robust, and everyone sets out their case clearly and articulately," said one member, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. "There are lots of people criticizing from the sidelines, but I think it's possible those people are angry they have been left on the sidelines."  A source who advises SAGE said: "Frankly, I find it hard to see that the presence of Cummings makes much difference. We're not talking about shrinking violets."  However, the source went on to express concern at how scientific evidence is being presented. "Science is not homogenous... The best SAGE can do is present imperfect material. The government has been able to take advantage of the public view of science as a voice of certainty, and present some of its decisions as being taken with more concrete certainty than they have."  This has prompted fears that at some time in the future, the government might try hiding behind the science for decisions they've taken -- or worse, throw members of SAGE under a convenient bus. "It certainly does seem to be an anxiety of some of my colleagues, but I am less worried. Many politicians are not exceptional thinkers. Should a public inquiry come, I would be surprised if it's the scientists who do a bad job of making their case," said a member of SAGE.  What next?  That public inquiry seems inevitable, once the worst of the crisis is over.  And when it comes, the government will stick to its line that the decision to prioritize the protection of the NHS was the right course of action, and that it succeeded. While it's true the NHS didn't fall over during what look like the worst weeks of the crisis, a cynic might claim that focusing on hospitals ignored what was happening in the wider community.  "People might well reply that it protected the NHS at the expense of shifting deaths elsewhere. Not to mention the physical and mental suffering experienced across the country," said one of the scientists advising SAGE.

It will not simply be a matter of easing social distancing measures.  Pankhania says the government must not be too influenced by economic pressures to bring back normality. "It is important to note that economics can be rebalanced, but lives lost cannot be bought back." He stresses that even if lockdown is lifted, the government must be prepared to "shut it down again."  Robert Dingwall, professor of social science at Nottingham Trent University and a member of NERVTAG, says: "The biggest challenge for the government is levels of fear and anxiety in the general population, which may make people reluctant to go along with the release from lockdown."  The UK's coronavirus story has been dramatic, even by international standards. While Johnson was off sick, legitimate questions concerning his government's handling of the pandemic were asked with few satisfactory answers from those stepping in to fill his shoes.  Johnson's inner circle hope his return to work will bring about a refreshed sense of energy and urgency. But many irreversible key decisions have already been made. When, how and why will determine the next phase of this story -- and how successful Johnson's government was when facing the nation's worst crisis in decades.

2020-04-30	(CNN) Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday the state is using the Maryland National Guard and state police to keep the coronavirus test kits it secured from South Korea safe -- including from the federal government.  When asked directly in a Washington Post Live interview about whether he was concerned the federal government would seize the shipment of tests, the Republican governor said, "It was a little bit of a concern about trying to get these things and it was a very complicated process." He said the plane was greeted on the tarmac by National Guard and state police personnel.  "This was an enormously valuable payload. It was like Fort Knox to us, because it was going to save the lives of thousands of our citizens," the Republican governor told The Washington Post Live about the delivery of the tests earlier this month.  "And there had been reports -- for example, in Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker told the story of his planeload came in with masks (and it) was basically confiscated by the federal government."  Hogan said the test kits are now in "an undisclosed location," still under protection from the National Guard and state police. He added that the state "wanted to make sure that that plane took off from Korea safely, landed here in America safely and that we guarded that cargo from whoever might interfere with us getting that to our folks that needed it."

(CNN) For three and a half years, Donald Trump has bet whatever global order he has fantasized on a diplomacy based on mano-a-mano relationships with strongmen and dictators. Now, in the age of Covid-19, this is all largely coming apart.  From Pyongyang to Moscow to Beijing, Riyadh and Brasilia, the pillars of Trump's world view are all finding their backs -- in one fashion or another -- to the wall, leaving their American counterpart way out and alone on an increasingly fragile global limb.  In North Korea, Kim Jong Un is or is not mortally ill or dead. There have been contradicting reports on his well-being following reports that he had heart surgery. Even up to this moment, however, Trump was still claiming a somewhat specious, close personal relationship. "I received a nice note from him recently. It was a nice note. I think we're doing fine," Trump told a news conference in mid-April.  Then, unsurprisingly, he launched back into his oft-repeated refrain that the United States would have been at war with North Korea had he not established this great relationship with the North Korean dictator. The foreign ministry issued an immediate and categorical denial: "There was no letter addressed recently to the U.S. president by the supreme leadership."  After the reports of Kim's disappearance, however, Trump was till sowing confusion. Monday during a news conference, Trump claimed he had a "very good idea" about the condition of North Korea's leader but that he couldn't "talk about it now." Later on in the news conference, Trump said "nobody knows where (Kim) is."  With Kim, at least for the moment, all but retired from the scene, a vacuum has been left that is not impossible to believe might be filled, at least on an interim basis, by the military that would then be in charge of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. Other possibilities include Chinese forces bolting in to secure the nuclear stockpile and missiles before they could go rogue or fall into any other hands. Regardless, the Kim-Trump axis would become meaningless at best, toxic at worst.  Meanwhile, China and its ruler, Xi Jinping, have their own problems. Wounded at home by his early mishandling of Covid-19, Xi is doing his best to emerge as a global force of strength with hardly a gesture of help for Trump, who's done his best to offload blame for Xi's mishandling of what Trump has dubbed the "Chinese Virus." The Chinese propaganda machine responded, with China Daily quoting Xi as emphasizing the "importance of making good use of the country's institutional strengths in responding to risks and challenges in an increasingly severe and complicated environment." Not once was Trump's name mentioned.  At the same time, China has gone out of its way to ease the US out of regions it views as central to its future as a global leader. Jack Ma, the founding chairman of Chinese internet titan Alibaba, dispatched planeloads of equipment and supplies, including 500 ventilators, personal protective equipment and coronavirus test kits for distribution across 54 African nations. Chinese state media were on hand to chronicle every step, according to The Economist.  Some medical products China shipped to Europe were said to have been sub-standard, however, and there have been bottlenecks in shipments abroad. Still, China remains a global supplier of critical medical supplies.  Another close Trump chum, Vladimir Putin, has seen his president-for-life ambitions thwarted -- at least for now -- citing the pandemic for why he suspended the national referendum on constitutional changes that would've extended his rule in Russia.  And now his country is riven with Covid-19. According to John Hopkins University numbers, Russia has over 100,000 total cases and over 1,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, Putin himself has largely retired from the scene. As Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Moscow Center wrote in an essay, Covid-19 has only underscored Putin's isolation from everyday Russians.  Still, Putin seems to have deftly seized on Trump's weaknesses at this moment to take America's standing in the global community down another notch, talking at least four times on the phone with Trump from March 30 to April 12, gluing him ever more closely to his toxic reign.  "Reaching out to the United States ... is part ... of Putin's long-term plan to basically undermine the credibility of the United States as an important stalwart player in the global system," Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told CNN.

Sound familiar?  What is especially sad, throughout, are the deep wounds Donald Trump's erratic behavior and even more toxic language have left on America's image in the world. As Ireland's leading political commentator, Fintan O'Toole, wrote in the Irish Times last weekend: "The world has loved, hated and envied the U.S. Now, for the first time, we pity it."  There may be no easy way to reverse this immediately. But an end to Trump tweetstorms and daily bloviating might be a good first step.
2020-04-30	Hong Kong (CNN Business) For most of this year, China has been living seven weeks in the future.  The world's second largest economy was the first to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak , which forced it to halt travel, shutter stores and theme parks, mandate masks in public and encourage the public to embrace social distancing.  Now, the country is gradually reopening . And as the rest of the world prepares to do the same, companies that were forced to first respond to the outbreak in China are using their early experiences to form a blueprint for other regions.  Corporate responses in China have become a focal point for Wall Street analysts in recent months, as global brands such asandshare their experiences in the country on calls with investors and credit their teams there for guiding them through the crisis.  Nike, for instance, recently said it was "seeing the other side of the crisis in China" and has learned best practices that could be transferred elsewhere. And whenreopened its giant plant in Wolfsburg , Germany, this week, it cited its experience resuming business at 32 of its 33 factories in China.  The new strategies that companies are introducing won't take life back to normal, according to business leaders and experts. Instead, they say the crisis could permanently upend the way we work, shop and manage our businesses.  "This is the new normal," said Alain Benichou, CEO of IBM China. "There are many wake-up calls that we are working on right now."  Here's a look at how the future of business has changed — and how China is giving us a preview.  The way we work  For Despina Katsikakis, the average workplace is already starting to look very different.  Cushman & Wakefield CWK Katsikakis, a London-based partner who focuses on innovation and emerging practices at commercial real estate firm, has been advising companies around the world on the return to work.  In China, the firm has already helped move more than 1 million workers back into offices. In Katsikakis' view, the crisis has fast-forwarded the future of work by as much as a decade.  The firm is hoping to capitalize on that shift, starting with a visual guide for its clients called the "Six Feet Office." The concept, a "living laboratory" in Cushman & Wakefield's Amsterdam office, was based on its takeaways from China and other feedback from workers and clients across the globe.  Commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield has built a prototype called the "Six Feet Office," which encourages workers to continue social distancing when they return to the office.  "It is a prototype that basically is there to inspire people to think about solutions, on how to bring into play social distancing, how to prepare the building appropriately, and really to nudge people towards different behaviors," said Katsikakis.  the virus. In this new normal, desks are, unsurprisingly, spaced out six feet apart. Health officials around the world have for months advised people to maintain this distance from one another to prevent spreadingthe virus.  Workers are instructed to walk "one way only" — clockwise — throughout the office, to avoid moving past each other and potentially spreading more germs. Katsikakis said the guidance was based on consultations with health care experts, who shared how medics were navigating in hospitals.  One of the biggest takeaways the firm has gained from China, she said, is that "we need to ensure we have trust that we're going back to a healthy environment."  Over the next few years, she envisions sensors replacing most of the shared surfaces we used to touch. Instead of swiping your entry pass to get indoors, for example, you might face a facial recognition camera or pull up a QR code on your phone.  In a new concept office, workers are directed to walk "one way only" — clockwise. (Credit: Cushman & Wakefield.)  Companies are also expected to invest more in air filtration systems in the office to reduce contaminants (Volkswagen, for example, has set its air conditioning units to max at Wolfsburg). Some may even install plexiglass sneeze guards at desks, said Katsikakis. To avoid contaminating surfaces, her firm suggests placing a pad of paper over your workstation and replacing it daily.  Since unveiling the "Six Feet Office" prototype, the firm has been flooded with inquiries every day — if not "every hour," the partner joked. "We've been doing daily briefings with some of our largest global clients to help them and their real estate teams look at how they can take these ideas and how we can co-create with them."  Though the concept calls for more space, it doesn't necessarily mean having an office will be more expensive. If there's one thing the situation has shown, it's that remote working is effective — and largely here to stay, said Katsikakis. That means fewer people will be using the same space than before the pandemic.  The way we communicate at work has also changed. The boom in demand for enterprise software, such as Microsoft Teams, has been "unprecedented," said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365.  He said Thursday that the messaging and video conferencing program now has 75 million daily users — up 70% from last month.  "We have a time machine as countries like China and South Korea have returned to work and school, and Teams usage continues to grow," Spataro told CNN Business.  The way we shop  In some ways, now is the perfect time for brands to pick up new customers and form lasting connections, said Deborah Weinswig, CEO of Coresight Research, an advisory and research firm that focuses on retail and technology.  As millions of people hunker down at home, they're being forced to create new routines and lifestyles, she noted.  "They always say it takes 21 days to change a habit," said Weinswig. "We are changing our shopping habits, and some of those will be quite sticky."  Nike, for instance, has pivoted so well it "could change the curve that [it's] on for many years to come," she said. (Coresight has previously worked on research projects for Nike.)  A pedestrian walking by a Nike store in Shanghai in March.  While the company was promoting online shopping prior to the outbreak, Weinswig said that business "really accelerated" in recent months. The sportswear giant reported strong earnings in March, partly because it was quick to accelerate its online business in China. Digital sales in Greater China rose more than 30% last quarter, while weekly active users for its activity apps shot up 80%, CEO John Donahoe told investors.  The company's flagship app was crucial to its success. The platform launched in China during this period, and encouraged users to work out from home through a virtual "training club," according to Coresight. Weinswig noted that the app was free, which was "critical" for users.  The company also launched more products online, including limited-edition sneakers such as Air Jordans.  Speed was crucial, too. Nike competes in a crowded space, but it was one of the first brands to pivot to customers staying at home, Weinswig noted.  "They were very early to adapt," she said.  The way we manage our supply chains  The pandemic may also force a reinvention of the global supply chain.  Generally, supply chains of consumer goods are "designed to prioritize efficiency over flexibility and resilience," John Knapp, a partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group, wrote in a recent blog post  But over the last few months, "shortages of raw materials and critical supplies, together with the specter of increased worker absenteeism, have laid bare the underlying risks," he noted.  That's forcing businesses to rethink how they ship or send out their goods.  "Things we used to take for granted don't exist anymore," said William Ma, group managing director of Kerry Logistics, a Hong Kong-based firm that helps companies around the world manage their supply chains.  "Right now, we can see all these disruptions along almost every segment of moving cargo in and out of China. Or getting into Europe — I can't get the truck to move across the border."  Goods being inspected at a foreign trade warehouse in Jiangsu Province, China in March.  Prior to the outbreak, businesses planned for outages of "days," Ma added. Now, they're looking at "weeks."  One firm hoping to save the day is IBM. The tech giant, which offers an AI-based supply chain management program, says it's seen a "significant" jump in demand as more customers seek out predictive modeling against the next crisis. The company declined to share specific numbers.  The pandemic was "a wake-up call" for many companies, said Benichou, the IBM China chief executive.  "What we want to [do] is clearly help on the issues that we've uncovered with the Covid-19. Supply chain optimization, we've just uncovered, so we need to treat that."  global editorial director of the Economist Corporate Network. The network is an advisory service of The Economist's Intelligence Unit, providing resources for senior business leaders. Even governments are getting in on the act. Last month, Japan announced a plan to help companies shift their production back home, said Andrew Staples,global editorial director of the Economist Corporate Network. The network is an advisory service of The Economist's Intelligence Unit, providing resources for senior business leaders.  "I think that will continue," he said.  The outbreak also exposed cracks in the supply chain that most companies didn't even know about, according to IBM researchers.  The company recently found that 90% of Fortune 1000 companies had secondary suppliers in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak began, but "many had little or no interaction with them," Jonathan Wright, an IBM executive, said in a company webcast last month.  At the same time, it may be too early for companies to confront this problem, said Ma.  He noted that rebuilding supply chains take significant capital and time — two things most businesses are short on at the moment.  "More important to them is the cash growth. If your things can't sell, you can't pay your suppliers, the suppliers cannot pay their vendors," he said. "[We] just want to get over this ASAP."
2020-04-30	(CNN) Mothers and fathers across America can relate to the struggles of parenting children who are home full-time right now.  Not every parent, however, is juggling being a single mom of an almost 2-year-old toddler wit h running a major city , like Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser . And because it's DC, she doesn't have the same resources for the city as other executives do. She's trying to get emergency funding, working on a plan to reopen businesses and looking to address inequality for the city's disproportionately hard-hit African Americans.  "The biggest concern that I have is making sure I keep myself safe and healthy, that I'm not contaminating my home or exposing my family to what I have to be exposed to because I'm out doing essential work," Bowser told CNN in a virtual interview.  So while she is looking out for her constituents in the ways all mayors nationwide are in the age of Covid-19 -- scrounging for tests and supplies -- she also wants to pass along what she has learned as a parent right now: "Give yourself a break."  "Don't be too hard on yourself," the Democratic mayor advised.  For example, this past weekend, because Bowser had to work, she broke her own rules about screen time.  "On the weekends, it's just me and her. I moved her highchair into my little home office and I got her coloring books out, her little toy computer. It was different because normally she wouldn't be in my office and I wouldn't let her watch TV, but we had to figure out how to make that work because I had some work that I had to get done, and she adjusted it," she recalled.  In this Jan. 2, 2019 file photo, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser kisses her daughter Miranda Elizabeth Bowser after being sworn in as mayor of the District of Columbia.  Bowser stresses that kids may not be in traditional classrooms right now, but they are still learning in a different way.  "Your kids are watching you. They're even watching how you work. They're listening to your calls. They're seeing how you get prepared in the morning. They're watching you work on the computer," she said.  "And there are lessons, there are life lessons in all of those things. They're seeing how you have to juggle making lunch with going back to a call."  Bowser adopted her daughter Miranda in 2018 -- when she'd already been in office for more than three years -- making her the first single mother to be DC's mayor.  She calls herself lucky because she still has home childcare and, because her daughter is so young, she doesn't have the challenge of distance learning that older children and their parents are coping with every day.  "She doesn't get to go to her swim lessons or ballet class, and she doesn't get to see her grandparents, which is probably the biggest downer for her and for them, and for me," she said.  'The mayor, the county executive and the governor'  District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser is sworn in as the seventh elected mayor of the District of Columbia and the first woman to ever be re-elected to the office during a ceremony at the Washington Convention Center, Jan. 2, 2019.  While other mayors have state governments to help, Bowser does not since she runs the nation's capital District of Columbia.  "As mayor, I have regular city functions that I perform, but I have things that I'm responsible for that no other mayor in America is responsible for. I'm the mayor, the county executive, and the governor for Washington, DC," she said.  She notes that DC has no US senators to fight for its interests, putting its some 700,000 constituents at a big disadvantage during the coronavirus crisis.  "That's how we were shortchanged in the first CARES Act," she said of the stimulus package passed by Congress last month. "We were treated as a territory, which we are not. We're very different from US territories in that we pay federal taxes, so the same taxes that they pay just a few miles from you in Maryland, we pay here in Washington, DC, but we don't have two senators." she said.  Because DC was designated as a territory in the first round of emergency funding approved by Congress, she says the city did not get some $750 million that she says is owed by the federal government to be on par with other states and cities across the country.  She said she fought to be included in the Trump administration's meetings with governors.  "It has been a constant fight to make sure that DC is on all of those calls with the President and the governors to make sure FEMA and everybody knows that we are treated for emergency response just like the 50 states," she said.  "I've had the opportunity to ask the President by video call, like we're doing now, very specific questions about Washington, the vice president, Secretary Mnuchin, which is where we have our real issue right now with Treasury and getting our fair share of the money," she said.  She was hoping DC being left out of the first package would be remedied in the last round of funding Congress passed, but it was not. Now, she spends a lot of her time lobbying the administration and Congress to fix this in the next round.  "That money will make sure that we can continue to provide a robust response that's not affecting the operation of our city services," she said.  The big question: When to let businesses re-open  Nearly two months into the pandemic-induced economic shutdown, Bowser is hearing more and more from business owners desperate to get back up and running.  But the Covid-19 modeling shows the DC surge has not yet happened, which makes joining the slowly growing trend to re-open trickier.  "Our model showed that we would have many thousand more cases than we have right now. We know our businesses and residents have been staying at home, which is helping drive down those cases," she said.  "So we think that we're working very hard to flatten the curve, and we're looking forward to getting on the other side of this pandemic," she added.  District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks about the city's response to the coronavirus, Monday, March 16, 2020, in Washington.  Because DC is the nation's capital, a big driver of the city's economy is business travel and tourism, not to mention a restaurant and bar scene that has exploded in the past several years.  With much of that shuttered, Bowser said more than 70,000 workers have had to file for unemployment.  "It's had a devastating impact for those businesses, workers, but also for the city's finances," she said.  Looking ahead, she expects major budget cuts for the city.  "We've lost $700 million in revenue that would have been coming in to support government operations, from trash pickup to teachers to police officers to firefighters. For next year that starts on October 1, we have to cut almost $800 million from that budget to meet our revenue projection, so it's not small," she lamented.  Addressing racial disparities  Bowser says about 80% of coronavirus-related deaths in DC are African Americans.  While she and other city officials are working hard to get access to health care and awareness to black communities, she is also actively looking ahead to find ways to address age-old problems about access and inequality as part of reopening the city.  "You know that there is work that we have to do, what I call the building blocks of healthy outcomes. How do we equalize access to good food and high-quality housing and jobs and education? These aren't new issues, as you know. These are decades old, generations old problems that we have in our country," she said.  Inequities when it comes to access to the internet have also been exposed in a way that she hopes the city can help to rectify so that students and workers can benefit down the road.  "Not just remote learning, but remote work, and how we do all of those things," she said.  Taking advantage of being inside the Beltway  Although she does not know when it will happen, Bowser says when DC does reopen "it won't be exactly the way it was."  "We have to think about how we go to restaurants differently. How do we even go to school differently?" she asked.  Bowser is taking advantage of the fact that she has lots of constituents with experience, brainpower and connections.  She appointed a bipartisan pair of heavyweights -- former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice and former Bush homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff -- to study various sectors of DC's economy and society.  "Gather the best global practices, gather the best science and techniques, and make recommendations about how we can slowly turn on our economy in a safe way," Bowser said.  She's also recruited world-renowned chef and philanthropist José Andrés to take the lead in guiding restaurants on re-opening plans.  And she enlisted one of the most famous DC residents -- former first lady Michelle Obama -- to record robocalls and radio ads reminding people to stay at home and giving people information about testing sites.  Improving testing  In the short term, to get to the point of lifting restrictions with better confidence, Bowser is working to make a plan for better Covid-19 testing.  While her neighbor in Maryland, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, procured tests from South Korea, Bowser sourced materials from China and sent teams for supplies, more frequently, around the United States.  "I think we sent a helicopter down to North Carolina to get some items. We're using Under Armour in Baltimore to do some other items. We're seeing some of the domestic supply chains open up," Bowser said.  She is also building and expanding what she calls contact tracing teams to learn a new post Covid-19 skill. The city's Department of Health officials is working on contacting people who have tested positive, interviewing them and reach out to the people they were in contact with.  "And all of those people are to limit their activity and stay home. And so that's how we're learning a lot more about it," she explained.  What keeps her up at night?  When asked what keeps her up at night -- the question we put to all the mayors across the country we have spoken to for this series -- Bowser answered without hesitation.  "The notion of really the great businesses in DC that had to shutter and those entrepreneurs wondering if they're going to be able to come back. The families who are trying to pay their rent and pay their mortgage, who just don't know if they're going to be able to, and the knowledge that these people have done absolutely nothing wrong. None of us have. It's just that this pandemic hit us, and they're really worried about the future. That keeps me up at night," she said.
2020-05-01	(CNN) America is stirring, but it's every state for itself.  May 1 brings an easing of stay-at-home orders as around half the states in the union move toward a resumption of everyday life, or what will pass for it in the immediate future, in the next few days.  A bewildering patchwork of openings and new distancing rules for restaurants, business offices, churches, dental practices and even gyms in some places will allow daily commerce to resume -- whether workers and customers are ready or not.  The easing of restrictions comes despite the fact that few, if any states, satisfy the White House guidelines of declining infections for 14 straight days before opening is contemplated. Some states, however, have flattened the curve of the pandemic.  The nation's top infectious disease expert warned states Thursday night not to deviate too much from the White House guidelines. "The discretion is given to the governors. They know their states, the mayors know their cities, so you want to give them a little wiggle room. But my recommendation is, you know, don't wiggle too much," Dr. Anthony Fauci said during CNN's coronavirus global town hall.  The momentum toward prying open restaurants, businesses and shops is taking place despite the Trump administration's failure to build a comprehensive testing network capable of testing millions of people a week, which epidemiologists say is vital to stopping a resurgence of the novel coronavirus.  That makes Friday and the next few weeks a moment of daunting reckoning as the country waits to see whether the opening unleashes a second wave of infections that runs out of control.  If it does, Americans may face the prospect of a return to stay-at-home orders that could destroy an economy that is already in tatters with more than 30 million people suddenly unemployed.  President Donald Trump, however, is itching to get out of Washington to make up for lost time in his reelection campaign, after claiming Thursday that his erratic and vengeful leadership at a time of national crisis had been a "spectacular" success.  He plans to travel to the swing state of Arizona next week -- even at the price of his vanity if he has to cover his face.  "Should I speak in a mask? You are going to have to tell me if that is politically correct," the President told reporters Thursday.  The state reopenings are a sign of progress, but their staggered nature is also a sign of how far the country has to go to beat the pandemic.  "Things are getting better and we can gradually resume some activities," Thomas Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday at an Aspen Institute forum.  "On the other hand, we're getting back, not to normal, we're going to get back to a new normal. And that's going to include physical distancing, hand sanitizer, face masks and avoidance ... of large gatherings where many people come together in one place," he said.  Still, Frieden cautioned that the longer fight against the pandemic, which he described as the worst public health threat in 100 years, is "just beginning."  A pandemic respects no state borders, and there is a real chance that states taking a risk by opening could eventually make the situation worse for all the others.  Meanwhile, unrest over the stay-at-home orders continues to percolate across the country. Restrictions in Michigan drove protesters, including some who were armed , into the state Capitol on Thursday. Trump offered sympathy to them on Friday morning, urging the state's Democratic governor to "give a little, and put out the fire."  "These are very good people, but they are angry," Trump tweeted. "They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal."  A mixed picture of openings and extended restrictions  In one sense, the staged openings represent federalism at work -- as local power in states across a vast nation is applied to local circumstances without directives from a distant government in Washington.  States including Texas, West Virginia, Utah, Arkansas and Georgia are moving toward various stages of reopening in the coming days. Others like Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine has moved slower to rave reviews , Arizona and Minnesota are extending lockdowns. And New York, New Jersey and California remain frozen in a cycle of death -- even if their pandemics have plateaued. A growing threat to the nation's food supply and some of its most vulnerable workers is meanwhile worsening, as more meat-processing plants reported mass infections of staff.  Still, amid the tragedy, small pockets of hope are opening across the land. The hospital ship USNS Comfort, sent to help New York in its darkest hour, slipped its berth and headed into the Atlantic for its voyage home to Virginia. The NASCAR racing series and horse racing on Churchill Downs in Kentucky are set to resume in a couple of weeks -- albeit without spectators. Golfers will soon be teeing off again in Dallas.  As states open, governors, mayors and community leaders will be accountable for the life-and-death decisions involved with a vicious virus with no proven cures and vaccines still at large.  In many ways, that's how the US system of government -- and embedded suspicion of federal authority -- says it should be.  But the big unknown is how the public, which polls show is still deeply wary of getting back outside, will respond. That reticence is one reason -- along with regulations like much reduced capacity at restaurants -- why the rocketing economic rebound that the President is predicting is unlikely to happen, at least at the beginning.  State openings hint at lack of national strategy  The jumble of conflicting restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, partial openings and businesses firing up, also reflects the utter lack of a coherent national strategy on the pandemic.  Trump has made quite clear that he sees it as the job of states to scale up testing and to supply their hospitals with protective gear while bringing the country back on line.  The federal government should simply be a backup, he says.  That attitude, and Trump's botched call that the virus would never threaten the US, have exacerbated the pandemic in the US, which has killed more than 60,000 Americans and infected more than a million in just a couple of months.  It has forced states to compete against one another, the federal government and foreign countries for personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses on the front lines, for instance.  And it led to the extraordinary spectacle of Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan ordering state police and the national guard to protect coronavirus testing kits he imported from South Korea -- including from the federal government.  The lack of effective leadership from Washington has convinced some states -- in the northeast, the Midwest and the Pacific coast -- to band together to coordinate on issues like when to open up and to negotiate with the federal government.  Trump becomes less relevant  In many ways, the states-led opening effort sidelines the President and makes his daily declarations and contradictions less relevant and a sideshow to the main act.  If his reelection does depend on a revived economy, his fate may be in the hands of state governors, including those Republicans who leapt at his encouragement to open.  But Trump may also benefit politically from the arms-length approach, which coincides with an end to his untamed daily briefings that aides feared were harming his reelection chances.  If states do well and infections do not suddenly peak again, the President will be sure to claim a share of the credit. If reopenings are a disaster, Trump will at least have some distance from individual decisions by state leaders -- even if the country will remember his pressure to get things moving again.  Trump's canceled daily briefings this week have also meant less visibility for senior public health officials like Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, whose science-based caution has sometimes detracted from his preferred narrative of a light at the end of the tunnel.  But the lack of a coordinated federal effort does substantially raise the risk of the patchwork state openings and could ultimately slow the nation's emergence from the crisis.  "If we want to deal with this, we'll need a comprehensive strategy. That strategy means we protect health care, we strengthen public health, we design parts of society, so we can reopen and resume and recover as quickly as possible without a rebound in cases," Frieden said.  "We need a comprehensive strategy," he emphasized, referring to a goal that may be too much to hope for from a chaotic administration that is more interested in claiming undeserved credit for its pandemic management than laying out new plans.  "I think I've handled it -- and not me; I think our whole group has been spectacular," Trump said Thursday, highlighting in particular the non-emergence of a once feared ventilator shortage.  A scenario in which many states are open and some are not will intensify the next massive political fight in Washington -- how to rescue revenue-deprived state governments following pleas from governor's mansions inhabited by both Democrats and Republicans.  "They happen to be Democratic states. It's California, it's New York, it's Illinois, you start with those three. And the Republican states are in strong shape. You know, I don't know, is that luck or talent? Or is it just a different mentality?" Trump said.
2020-05-01	(CNN) When it comes to the coronavirus, South Australia ought to now be considered among the safest places in the world. That was the message from one of the country's leading public health officials this week, as much of Australia began the slow process of easing restrictions.  That many Australians now find themselves in such an enviable position would have been unthinkable only a month ago, during which time nationwide daily infection rates reached into triple figures. But on Friday, the entire country reported just 16 new cases, a sharp decline from a peak of 460 new infections on March 28.  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday the National Cabinet will meet on May 8 to consider easing lockdown measures, bringing forward the discussion from the week beginning May 11.  "Australians have earned an early mark," Morrison said. "We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society."  In some states, the curve has completely flattened: Queensland hasn't reported any new cases since Monday, and South Australia has seen no new infections for more than a week.  "No more cases in South Australia. This is a landmark for us," South Australia Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said with a big smile during a press briefing on Wednesday.  The southern state of 1.6 million people, home to the country's fifth most populous city Adelaide, has reported 438 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with only 14 remaining active cases and four deaths, according to the SA government  "I think many people are surprised in Australia at how well we have done. Really, when you look across all the states and territories, this is the safest place to be in the world, perhaps other than New Zealand," she said.  Neighboring country New Zealand recently achieved its ambitious goal of "eliminating" the coronavirus , meaning that while the daily infection rate has yet to reach zero, the country is able to track the origins of each new case.  A group of men walk on Bondi Beach on May 01 in Sydney, Australia, following the easing of lockdown measures in response to a decline in coronavirus cases across the state.  In total, Australia, which has a population of around 25 million people, has reported 6,762 confirmed cases. Ninety two of those cases have resulted in death, and 5,720 have since recovered, according to the federal health authority.  "We're continuing to do very well around Australia to suppress the virus and we have well and truly flattened the curve of cases and new infections," said a spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health in a statement Thursday to CNN.  "Safety has been our fundamental focus and the success of our suppression strategy has meant Australia is in a very similar (place) to New Zealand, which has stated its strategy is aimed at elimination."  Some Australian states have already started to begin the process of easing restrictive measures and social-distancing rules. West Australia and South Australia relaxed the limit on public gatherings, up from two people to 10 people.  In Western Australia, which saw several "zero-case" days in the past week, national parks reopened on Friday, and nearly 60% public school students have returned for the start of a new term.  In the remote Northern Territory , where no new cases have been reported for three weeks, residents will be able to use public swimming pools, waterparks, go fishing with friends and play golf starting from Friday. The state has also laid out plans to restart its economy, allowing restaurants, pubs and gyms to reopen on May 15 and lifting the remaining restrictions on June 5.  Surfers wait for officials to open Bondi Beach in Sydney on April 28 as coronavirus pandemic restrictions are eased. The beach is open to swimmers and surfers to exercise only.  Restrictive measures  Australia's success in taming the outbreak started with early measures to bar entry from high-risk areas.  On February 1, Australia joined the United States in closing its borders to all foreign visitors who had recently been in China, where the outbreak was first reported in December last year.  As the virus spread and outbreaks flared beyond China, Australia barred entries from Iran, South Korea and Italy in early March, before closing its borders completely to all non-citizens and non-residents on March 19.  But the country has also had its shares of missteps. On March 19, it allowed more than 2,600 passengers to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney, despite multiple previous outbreaks elsewhere in the world involving cruise ships. Over 600 cases and 15 deaths have since been linked to the ship, according to public broadcaster ABC.  People wave as the cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, some 80 kilometres south of Sydney, on April 23, after a few hundred virus-free crew members disembarked to begin the process of repatriation to their home countries.  As the number of cases soared in late March, Morrison announced on March 22 all bars, clubs, cinemas, gyms and places of worship would be closed indefinitely, while restaurants and cafes would be restricted to take-away only -- but supermarkets, clothing stores, chemists and beauty salons would be allowed to remain open.  "What we're doing is closing down gatherings in pubs and clubs and things of that nature, we're not putting in place lockdowns that would confine people to their home," Morrison said at the time.  The state of Victoria closed schools, and some states, such as West Australia and South Australia, closed their borders, requiring anyone to enter to go into two weeks of quarantine.  By the end of March, authorities imposed stricter social-distancing rules, limiting public gathering to two people from the previous 10. People were urged to stay home and only go out if it is "absolutely essential," such as shopping for food, exercising, and for medical reasons.  Ever expanding testing  While closure of businesses, schools, travel restrictions and social distancing rules are common measures adopted by many governments around the world, Australia also paired these restrictions with widespread testing.  To date, more than 570,000 tests have been conducted across Australia, according to the Department of Health.  In comparison, the United Kingdom, with a population more than 2.5 times of Australia, has carried out 763,387 tests.  Medical practioners conducting tests for Covid-19 at a drive-thru testing facility in a parking lot on April 30 in Melbourne, Australia.  On March 25, Australian expanded its testing criteria to include all health care workers, aged care workers, prisoners and people in other identified hotspots who have fever or acute respiratory symptoms. Previously, only people who recently returned from overseas or who had come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus case could be tested.  Last week, the criteria was further expanded to anyone displaying even the mildest symptoms for Covid-19, Federal Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy announced.  "Anybody with acute respiratory symptoms, cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms, flu-like symptoms, can get tested," Murphy said at a press conference Friday, according to ABC  On Monday, Murphy said Australia will start testing asymptomatic cases for the first time "to be absolutely sure that we are capturing every case that we can and that we're not missing cases."  Drawing ire from Beijing  While Australia appears to be successfully containing the coronavirus, it has become embroiled in a diplomatic spat with China after it demanded an international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.  The bipartisan push for a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, including China's handling of the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan, begun last week, with Foreign Minister Marise Payne urging China to allow transparency in the process, according to ABC  The push quickly drew the ire of Beijing, which slammed the move as "political maneuvering."  In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Chinese Ambassador Jingye Cheng even warned of an economic backlash if Australia continued its push for an independent inquiry, suggesting that the Chinese public may boycott Australian products or decide not to visit Australia in the future.  A day after Cheng's stern warning, Morrison vowed to continue to push for the inquiry at a press conference on Wednesday, calling it a "fairly obvious and common sense suggestion."  "This is a virus that has taken more than 200,000 lives across the world. It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary," he said.  "It would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again...I believe there will be support for at the right time, to ensure we do that," added Morrison.
2020-05-01	UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock Pool  Matt Hancock, the UK's Health Secretary, proudly announced on Friday that the country had hit an ambitious coronavirus testing target that it had set itself at the beginning of the month.  On April 2, after weeks of criticism that the UK was lagging behind its European counterparts like Germany on testing, Hancock told the nation that he was "setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day, by the end of this month. That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there."  Today, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten that goal by more than 22,000.  Striking an upbeat tone, Hancock said: "I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal." Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to members of the public, but not necessarily returned.  Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers. "Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out."  The issue of testing didn't need to become so political.  When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.  It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out — such as rolling out a contact tracing program.  So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time — and no one can deny that more testing is undeniably a positive thing — it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying.
2020-05-01	(CNN) We have heard for weeks now that California has been handling the coronavirus right. The Bay Area was among the first places to shut down in the US, and Gov. Gavin Newsom has laid out strict parameters on how reopening will go. (The short of it: There will be no Disneyland for a while. )  So this story about the state just now sending a memo closing beaches in Orange County is seriously confusing. It turns out there's a patchwork of rules in California just like most other places. Los Angeles and San Diego beaches have been closed. Orange County and Ventura beaches have been open, although with parking and other restrictions.  While California is tamping down on OC beachgoers, parts of Florida are moving to partially open up, although the state's three largest counties are going their own way. We know states are different -- more than half of US states are following Georgia and starting to open , while Ohio is extending its stay-at-home order -- but there are also differences within each state.  Crowded beaches is exactly the thing that got Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in trouble some weeks ago. (Granted, the DeSantis beach scandal included Spring Breakers. ) Crowded beaches were also the thing that prompted Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to buckle down at the end of March. So now I can't play tennis down the street or go to any park in my neighborhood -- and that, more than seeing celebrities retreat to vacation homes or anything else, is sparking real envy.  This frustration I'm feeling -- is your lockdown better than my lockdown? -- may be part of the larger end to national spirit around this thing. That's true even as we all come to grips with the fact that staying safely at home is a luxury , too.  This has gone on much longer than expected. People saw their kids leave school and thought it would last a few weeks. Now, for most Americans, the school year is over. And a month or more into social distance orders, there's no real end to Covid-19 in sight.  If, like me, you're sitting in a state that hasn't seen a great reduction in Covid-19 cases, then you might be scared by the prospect of opening up, like Georgia or Texas are moving to do. Nobody wants Georgia or Texas to fail as they open up. You want them to succeed because the alternative is more deaths.  But the reality is that they are ignoring the public health professionals, so if they succeed, it throws into question what the rest of us in what presidential son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner calls the "eternal lockdown crowd" are doing.  Getting antsy. Gallup has Gallup has detected a slight shift away from respect for social distance . Most people still say they're doing it, but not as strictly.  They're starting to travel a bit more, albeit by car and not by plane or public transportation. Are you going to stay in your house all summer long? , albeit by car and not by plane or public transportation. Are you going to stay in your house all summer long? Probably not.  States are hiding supplies from the federal government. At least, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said tests his state got from South Korea are At least, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said tests his state got from South Korea are being stored in an undisclosed location so that the federal government can't commandeer them.  The long haul. Even if your state stays closed, Covid is not going away -- and the shine is starting to fall off as life continues without us.  And, sadly, so does death. I've heard multiple stories of people nearing the end of their lives for non-Covid reasons spending their last days alone or without their families. CNN's David Gelles wrote about this a while ago as he grieved for his mother, but it is ever more important and just plain sad.  Life is happening. We're just not able to live it the way we used to, no matter where we are.  Open in Wuhan feels like closed in the US  CNN's David Culver went to Wuhan and filed a report about what the new normal there looks like now that the city has started to open up. I couldn't shake the feeling that Wuhan opening feels a lot like my neighborhood shut down . Read this:  Noticeably shuttered still are fitness centers and movie theaters, with no immediate plans to reopen.  Most the stores that have reopened have changed their business models. Major chains like Starbucks, McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Pizza Hut are among the brands preventing customers from entering the physical space. Instead tables are setup at the storefronts and staff brings up the orders to hand off.  Even shut down, US society has stayed relatively open compared to other countries. There are a few curfews in the US, as in Boston, but certainly no national guideline.  All of this has been done differently in different states and different countries, which has partially led to different outcomes. Again, California, which I thought was one of the most restrictive states, is just now fully closing some of its beaches.  Americans are still nervous  President Donald Trump says we might not need testing. The CEO of Hilton, who was at the White House this week, says we do . He's right: CNN's polling director Jenn Agiesta notes that a new survey from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College finds broad majorities of the American public feel it is a bad idea for people to return to several everyday activities without further testing for the coronavirus.  Bipartisan majorities. On almost every item tested, those majorities stretch across party lines.  Not ready for sports. There is the broadest agreement that the country is not yet ready for sporting events: 91% say it's a bad idea to allow large groups of people to attend sporting events without further testing, including 97% of Democrats, 92% of independents and 83% of Republicans.  Not ready for school. Further, 85% say it's a bad idea for students to return to school without more testing, including 94% of Democrats, 89% of independents and 71% of Republicans.  Not ready for restaurants. Eight in 10 (80%) say it's a bad idea to open restaurants for people to eat in them, including 63% of Republicans, 82% of independents and 92% of Democrats.  Not ready for work. About two-thirds, 65%, say it is a bad idea for people to return to work without further testing. Among Democrats, 84% feel that way as do 65% of independents, but a narrow majority of Republicans (51%) say it's a good idea for people to return to work even without further testing. (Notably, men are far more likely to consider this a good idea (40%) than are women (24%).)  That should be repeated. 30.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment for the first time in just the past six weeks.  Also, people are hoarding cash. We've reached the highest savings rate since 1981 . It's a sign nobody knows what's going to happen in all this, and no one feels secure.  Trump in charge  Trump was asked Thursday about the new "Operation Warp Speed" initiative to develop a vaccine. Here's what he said:  Are they overpromising?  "I'm not overpromising. I don't know who said it but whatever the maximum is, whatever you can humanly do, we're going to have," Trump said. "I hope we're going to have a vaccine, and we're going to fast-track it like you've never seen before, if we come with a vaccine. I think they probably will."  Who is in charge?  "You know who is in charge of it, honestly? I am," Trump said. "I will say, we're dealing with, as you know, the general and the admiral. They're very much in charge. But I think probably, more than anything, I'm in charge. And I'm the one that gets blamed. And I get blamed anyways."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) "Our death totals, our numbers, per million people, are really very, very strong," President Donald Trump boasted on Thursday, despite the fact that the US ranks far worse than most countries in deaths-per-million people from Covid-19, according to Worldometers . "We're very proud of the job we've done," Trump gushed.  "Strong" is not the word that comes to mind looking at the country with the world's highest number of Covid-19 deaths -- a number that keeps growing with every passing hour. More than 2,000 people are dying of the disease each day in the US; that's more than 80 every hour, more than one every minute.  And yet, Trump has already spoken about the pandemic in the past tense and, not surprisingly, showered himself with praise. "We did a spectacular job," he said , echoing the message from his son-in-law and top advisor Jared Kushner, who told Fox News on Wednesday that the administration's response to the coronavirus is a "great success story."  Incredibly, Trump is repeating his disastrous strategy from the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, when he acted as if the coronavirus was a political and PR problem that could be fixed with empty reassurances and propaganda, rather than a public health crisis demanding smart and forceful action.  Trump's utterances between January and the first part of March -- denying, minimizing and peddling junk science as the unfolding disaster cast its shadow -- are now legendary. "Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away," he said on February 10. It's all "very much under control," he said on February 23. On February 27, with 15 cases in the United States, he declared , "In a couple of days we're going to be down close to zero."  Those words are indelible, irrefutable proof of his incompetence. So, you'd think after six weeks of trying to recover from that disaster, Trump would avoid repeating the same mistake. Instead, he's dusting off the old playbook.  "It's going to go. It's going to leave," Trump asserted on Wednesday when a reporter asked him why he thought the virus would be gone without a vaccine. "It's going to be eradicated," he continued, without offering any evidence to back up his obviously false assertions.  This week, Trump has embellished, exaggerated and lied, then lied about his lies and spread another layer of lies on top of the old ones. On Tuesday, he said the US would soon be ready to administer 5 million tests per day, only to deny making those claims the next day (It's all on tape ). He even went so far as to claim the President of South Korea called to congratulate him on what a fantastic job he's doing. (South Korea, which has handled the pandemic far more effectively that the US, diplomatically said it would not discuss its conversations with the Trump administration.) The core message Trump is trying to sell is that he's done a fantastic job -- that the problem is, for the most part, resolved, and that anyone who questions that is lying because they don't like him.  That Trump cannot resist puffing himself up is nauseating, but it doesn't necessarily lead to people's deaths. Other parts of his strategy, however, have a real impact on people's lives.  Trump allowed national social distancing directions to expire this week , leaving it up to state governors to take charge of when and how to reopen. What is most disturbing is that he is encouraging governors to violate guidelines for reopening the country that he personally announced from the White House two weeks ago.  For a brief moment, Trump took ownership of what was meant to be a careful return to normalcy. He branded the guidelines "Opening Up America Again," putting his MAGA fingerprints on a public health program. Among other things, the plan called for robust testing and 14 days of declining cases before loosening restrictions.  Those conditions have not been met, and now states are reopening to varying degrees, in violation of White House instructions. The President's reaction? "We've given them tremendous encouragement and support. We're backing them 100%.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has stepped in yet again to curb the President's claims. He issued a warning to local leaders against "leapfrogging" critical milestones, and called it a "significant risk" to reopen without them.  But the President seems terrified about his dimming reelection prospects and is obviously anxious to see the economy moving again.  If there's one powerful factor working to mitigate the pernicious impact of Trump's politically-motivated rush to reopen, it's that the American public watched what happened when he denied and downplayed the threat of the virus at the onset of the pandemic. Despite protests and a handful of states easing orders to stay at home, the overwhelming majority of Americans think it's too soon to reopen, according to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll.

(CNN) The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 now significantly exceeds the total US troop fatalities during the Vietnam War.  While the coronavirus continues to ravage the country, with confirmed cases exceeding 1 million and deaths rising by the day, some states are lifting stay at home orders in hopes of salvaging the economy. With so many lives at stake, it's time the United States looked to those countries in the Asia Pacific region that have successfully controlled the pandemic to figure out how to save ourselves and the economy.  Several places in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, have reported suppressing the reproduction number -- the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person -- to below 1, without the need for continued, widespread lockdowns.  They are now rapidly and successfully suppressing outbreaks of the disease by isolating those who are infected and their contacts who are likely to be infected.  It's as if there are two worlds.

2020-05-02	A version of this story appeared in the May 2 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  The US Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted the experimental drug emergency-use authorization to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19. The decision comes just days after a government-funded study found that patients who took remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not.  Gilead Pharmaceuticals originally designed the antiviral drug to treat Ebola, but results were disappointing. Instead, remdesivir has become the world's first authorized therapy treatment for Covid-19.  Recent weeks have witnessed a relentless quest for a viable Covid-19 treatment, with at least 72 active trials underway in the US alone. These include experiments with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, drugs that treat arthritis and a heartburn treatment.  Still, remdesivir is not the holy grail. While it may speed up recovery from Covid-19, it does not stop people from catching the novel coronavirus. Experts have repeatedly underlined that the pandemic will not subside until an effective vaccine is widely available.  Human trials for a vaccine are under way in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. But questions are mounting. A CNN investigation shows that the US is making a big bet on a company with unproven technology and a storied history.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: The flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this?  A: This is no longer true. The US death toll from coronavirus this year has exceeded 65,000, surpassing the high-end estimate for flu deaths since October.  The novel coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu for several reasons. It is much more contagious and has been killing victims at a much faster rate. The coronavirus incubation period seems much longer than that of the flu. With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection. For coronavirus, however, it can take up to 14 days for people to feel symptoms. The fact that it kept spreading in the southern hemisphere during its summer months suggests that, unlike the flu, warm weather won't slow its spread. Experts say many deaths could be prevented with access to existing flu vaccines. But there is no vaccine for the coronavirus.  Send your questions here .

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  India reports its biggest single-day jump in cases  Some experts say the numbers suggest the country's nationwide lockdown to halt the spread could be working, for now.  And while testing rates per capita are very low in India, experts say the country seems to be catching most of the moderate and serious cases. If a huge surge in Covid-19 cases were not being caught by testing, experts add, hospitals would be crowded with cases and there would be a spike in flu-like symptoms. That has not been the case.  India's strict lockdown measures were originally scheduled to lift Sunday, but they were recently extended for another two weeks.  White House blocks Fauci from testifying  The White House will keep Dr. Anthony Fauci , a key member of the administration's coronavirus task force, from testifying before the Democratic-led House next week, even though he is scheduled to testify in the Republican-led Senate.  The move will prevent a potential meeting between the blunt, high-ranking expert and lawmakers gearing up for an oversight battle, Jim Acosta and Caroline Kelly write . Fauci has repeatedly distanced himself from Trump's framing of the federal government's handling of the pandemic to strike a more somber tone.  He came home from hospital to die. His son kept him alive  When Suri Nathwani returned from hospital, he pleaded with his son Raj to be allowed to die at home. Death was not an outcome Raj was willing to accept, but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not good.  Raj used a Google spreadsheet, store-bought health aids and a baby monitor to help save his dad from dying. Raj knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. "He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips," Raj said.

2020-05-03	Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.  (CNN) Gone were the daily White House briefings with Vice President Mike Pence solemnly urging Americans to shelter at home to stop the spread of Covid-19 and governors to follow a slowly phased-in reopening plan. The 45 days of federally recommended social distancing ended Thursday. Now the Trump administration was all-in on reopening America.  Governors in Georgia, Texas and Colorado, among others, were opening their states. The Senate was on its way back to Washington and the President left the confinement of the White House, headed to Camp David for the weekend and was making plans to travel around the country.  Despite the warnings of health experts, President Donald Trump was no longer trying to hedge his bets. And one of the biggest gambles in American history was about to begin. In a James Bond movie, the croupier would be spinning the roulette wheel and saying, "Les jeux sont faits" (the bets are made).  As Peter Bergen noted, the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner went on Fox News to declare that "the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus" is a "great success story," claim that "we have all the testing we need to start opening the country" and state his hope that "by July, the country's really rocking again."  At the same time " more than 60,000 Americans lie dead -- more than the death toll of the Vietnam War -- and more than 1 million have been confirmed to have been infected with the virus with no end in sight," Bergen wrote. "There is widespread agreement among experts that we don't have the testing capabilities to return to any semblance of normal life and also that a second wave of infections could hit the country badly later in the year."  Will the reopenings spark new outbreaks and lead to new shutdowns? Will they jumpstart an economy that is about as bleak as anything since the Great Depression? Or will Americans, as polls suggest, be too wary to venture into public places until they are confident that their health can be protected from the virus that causes Covid-19?

" "Americans of all stripes are bound together by a common calamity, hungry for a unifying leader who will rise above partisanship," observed. " But that is not Trump's nature . He has suggested that governors, desperately asking the federal government for more testing supplies, were acting out of political motivation."  Frida Ghitis. Experts are in agreement that much more widespread testing is crucial to safely reopening the country, but the White House has opted to let the states take the responsibility for that. "Incredibly, Trump is repeating his disastrous strategy from the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, when he acted as if the coronavirus was a political and PR problem that could be fixed with empty reassurances and propaganda, rather than a public health crisis demanding smart and forceful action," wrote  editors of the National Review wrote. "Overall, it's impossible to exaggerate the economic cost of the lockdowns, which have brought on a steep recession that we will probably spend years digging out of. This is why impatience to reopen is an entirely understandable sentiment, even if it is treated by much of the media as heretical. "Parts of the country are starting to reopen, and it's a good thing," thewrote.

This is why impatience to reopen is an entirely understandable sentiment, even if it is treated by much of the media as heretical. A balance obviously has to be struck ...we can't stay locked down until the virus is entirely vanquished, or we will have destroyed the country to save it."  Pence unmasked  Vice President Mike Pence made news when he visited the Mayo Clinic Tuesday and stood out as the only person photographed not wearing a mask. Michael D'Antonio marveled at Pence's response to the mask question: "Since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health care personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you."  "The illogic in what Pence says is so obvious that pointing it out seems ridiculous but here we go : First, medical masks do not block the eyes. Indeed, Pence could have seen everyone else's eyes and his own baby blues would have sparkled brightly even with a mask," D'Antonio wrote. "Second, tests only show a person is virus-free at a specific moment in time. For this reason, he cannot be certain he did not catch the virus between his test and his visit to Mayo."  Samantha Vinograd. Presidents get a carefully vetted intelligence brief in writing daily along with oral briefings. "But you can't lead a horse to water and force him to drink.

Hertling recognizes the historic and emotional value of the elaborate graduation ceremony each year at the military academy on the banks of the Hudson. Yet he questioned the Army's decision to call back the nearly 1,000 cadets, who had been kept away for months because of Covid-19, for a ceremony June 13 at which Trump is scheduled to speak.  Having a President address the graduating class "contributes to the sense of pride and accomplishment. But the 'reward,' which appears heavily weighted to advantage the political desires of the President versus the safety of the cadets -- doesn't overcome the associated resource and personnel risks. In other words, the juice isn't worth the squeeze ."  The science  Smart reopening decisions depend on data, and while there are huge amounts of it, their reliability isn't always certain. The number of confirmed cases in a given state or country is partly dependent on who gets tested. And the number of deaths due to Covid-19 is notoriously hard to pin down, as a study from the Yale School of Public Health and the Washington Post made clear this week.  John D. Sutter, whose work as a reporter for CNN helped pinpoint the likely death toll after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. "The researchers found 15,400 excess deaths in the United States from March 1 through April 4, the early weeks of the coronavirus's rampage through this country. During that time, only about half that many deaths -- 8,128 -- had been attributed to Covid-19, according to the report."

Kent Sepkowitz credited South Korean authorities for quickly closing down the building once the outbreak was discovered: "Had the investigators waited a week, In South Korea, a new peer-reviewed study documented how widely the virus spread in one part of the 11th floor of a building housing a call center, along with residences.

The virus knows no walls: Once a business is infected, the entire community may quickly become infected, unless dramatic action -- such as occurred in Seoul -- is taken."  More than 4,900 workers at meat and poultry processing plants have developed the disease and at least 20 have died of it. This week the President, who had been reluctant to use the Defense Production Act at earlier stages of the pandemic, invoked it to order the processing plants to continue operating.  Raul A. Reyes. "It endangers the health of some of America's most vulnerable workers, many of whom are Latino, African American and immigrants. It prioritizes corporate interests over workers' lives."

The Trump administration has given credence to an unproven theory that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese virology lab in Wuhan and says it is investigating the matter. Meanwhile the National Institutes of Health abruptly terminated a research grant into the spread of coronaviruses from bats to people. The NIH confirmed the decision but wouldn't comment on why.

Biden has now given one. We need to decide whether we believe him. In doing so, we must also follow the facts.  And we should cast a wary eye at those who have a vested interest in promoting and tweeting about such accusations -- whether they are Republicans, such as the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, and the president's son, Don Jr. -- or prominent supporters of Biden's Democratic primary opponents (such as Bernie Sanders' former campaign staffers), who spend more time saying we should honor Ms. Reade's relatively thin allegations than they do demanding investigations into more than a dozen women who have credibly accused Trump of sexual harassment or worse (Trump denies those allegations.)"

2020-05-03	President Donald Trump said Sunday night that he was first briefed about coronavirus on January 23 and indicated the US intelligence agencies would be issuing a statement in the coming days.  On January 23rd, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import. In other words it wasn’t, ‘Oh we gotta do something, we gotta do something.’ It was a brief conversation and it was only on January 23rd," Trump said on Fox News.  While Trump claims he was told that "there could be a virus coming in," that January 23 briefing came three days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States.  The President was also briefed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the threat of the coronavirus during a January 18 phone call, according to multiple reports.  Trump also said that at the time the US intelligence community was not "competently run."  "And the intelligence agencies, which have now -- now, now -- because before they weren't, which are now very competently run with some great people ... the intelligence agencies will tell you that tomorrow," Trump said.  CNN and other news outlets have reported that the President's daily intelligence briefing included information about the coronavirus outbreak in China and its potential to spread to the United States as early as January 3. It is not clear whether Trump -- who infrequently reads the President's Daily Brief compiled by intelligence officials -- read the information at the time or whether officials briefing the President in person raised the issue.
2020-05-04	Mounted Israeli security forces patrol at a market due to restrictions imposed as measures against the novel coronavirus in Jerusalem on April 25. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images/FILE  Israel unveiled its comprehensive exit plan Monday evening as the country prepares to reopen malls and open-air markets in an easing of the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus.  Markets and malls will reopen Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, laying out the latest regulations. He added that the key to reopening more of the economy would depend on social distancing, hygiene, and the wearing of masks.  Netanyahu warned that the country’s gradual emergence from lockdown was conditional upon coronavirus figures maintaining their downward trend.  Among the announcements, citizens will no longer be required to remain within 100 meters of their homes. In addition, gatherings of up to 20 people will be permitted, as well as weddings of up to 50 people, though dancing remains forbidden in order to maintain social distancing.  It is now permissible to visit immediate family, including the elderly, Netanyahu said, but physical contact must still be avoided.  Kindergarten and daycares will open on Sunday. Sports and leisure facilities will gradually reopen by mid-June.  Netanyahu warned that a second and more serious wave of coronavirus infections remains possible. He laid out a metric for determining if restrictions need to be reimposed.  He said the gradual reopening would have to stop immediately, and new restrictions would be put in place if...  There are more than 100 new infections a day  The rate of infection doubles within 10 days  There are more than 250 patients in serious condition  As of Monday evening, the Ministry of Health reported 16,246 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Israel, an increase of only 44 in the past 24 hours. The ministry reported 235 deaths as a result of the virus.
2020-05-05	(CNN) We've addressed early questions about testing for Covid-19, but plenty remain. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains the latest on the different types of coronavirus tests and how well they work.  You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: When you were a kid, did you ever make one of those pinhole cameras? Where you cut a little hole into a piece of cardboard and then looked through it? Well, in some ways, that's kind of how we're looking at the coronavirus noawadays: through a tiny little window.  Part of the reason we haven't been able to get a bigger picture is because this is a new coronavirus, and we're learning as we go along.  We've also had inadequate testing across the nation, so the inability to know the true extent of this outbreak becomes a major barrier in terms of getting the country back to work. We need clearer vision, and so far, we haven't had that.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is "Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."  Gupta: There are currently only two types of coronavirus tests available in the United States. Because I'm a health care worker who still takes care of patients in the hospital, I've had both of them.  Doctor: I'm going to give you a little poke over here. OK?  Gupta: OK.  Doctor: Poke. You doing OK?  Gupta: Yep.  Doctor: And just like that, we're all done.  Gupta: That's it. OK.  Doctor: Let's get you wrapped up.  Gupta: Early on, there were some significant delays in testing, and there was also the release of a flawed test, which really put us far behind.  Since then, there have been a lot of unauthorized, unvalidated tests, which have flooded the market.  The most common and most accurate test we have is called a PCR test -- a polymerase chain reaction test. Now that's the one that detects whether or not someone is currently infected with Covid-19. It involves a saliva test in some cases, or more commonly, a nasal swab. CNN's [Anchor] Brooke Baldwin referred to it as a "brain tickler."  Brooke Baldwin, CNN News Anchor: Oooooh!  Doctor: One more. ... All done.  Baldwin: [giggle]  Gupta: So that gets sent off to a lab, where the genetic material is extracted. And because there's such a small amount of that genetic material, it is then amplified. That's the polymerase chain reaction. If all goes well, results usually come back within a few hours, but it can take a few days if you have to send it to a lab somewhere.  Then there are the antibody tests. Those are the ones that can determine whether or not someone has had Covid-19 in the past and might have some immunity to it now. Those involve collecting a small blood sample, either through a needle in the vein or through a blood spot sample.  But here's the problem: Antibody tests have not been consistently accurate. There are a lot of bad tests out there, and it's still unclear how much those antibodies might protect you from the virus in the future.  When you're testing for the virus, the biggest problem would be having a false negative. Why? Because you would think that you don't have the virus, and then you might go back out into the community, into a nursing home, into a hospital -- and potentially infect people.  With the antibody test, what you're really hoping to avoid is a false positive. Then, someone might feel that they have the antibodies, thus feel that they are protected, go out into the community, to a hospital, to a nursing home and spread the virus.  So with the diagnostic virus test, you really have to reduce false negatives; with the antibody test, you really have to reduce false positives.  Kevin de León, senior fellow at University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy: The promise of the immunology test to find out if we have the antibodies is huge.  Gupta: That's Kevin de León, senior fellow at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. The institute supports test sites across Los Angeles.  De León: This can influence policy makers at the local, at the state and federal level. That can actually inform us when it comes to social distancing. If I'm immune, and scientifically I've been proven to be immune, then I can reenter the workforce and I can play a bigger role in making sure we're safer.  Gupta: A company called Roche announced that it received emergency-use authorization -- EUA -- for an antibody test it claims is more accurate than most.  Roche says it has already started shipping its new test to leading labs around the world.  Here's Roche CEO Severin Schwan.  Severin Schwan, Roche CEO: It's really special because it's so accurate, it's almost near-perfect accuracy. And what that allows us is to really reliably test whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus or not, irrespective of whether you had symptoms or not.  Gupta: Now there's another kind of test that could be useful here. It's called an antigen test. Again, the test for the virus is the PCR or diagnostic test. The test for the antibody is called a serology test.  And now the antigen tests look for a protein on the surface of the virus. You may have already had one of these if you've ever had a test for strep throat or the flu.  Here's the problem: A reliable antigen test for the coronavirus isn't yet available in the United States, but the hope is that we'll soon have something that works kind of like an at-home pregnancy test, where a test strip would change color to tell if you might have the virus.  Frederick Nolte is a pathology professor and the head of coronavirus testing at the Medical University of South Carolina.  Frederick Nolte, Medical University of South Carolina professor and director of clinical laboratories: Antigen detection has been part of the diagnostic landscape for a number of years, and it has a number of appeals. It can be done relatively quickly, it's inexpensive, it can be deployed in a number of clinical settings outside of the laboratory, near to patients. But the chief concern with it has been the sensitivity.  Gupta: And a low sensitivity means a high false negative. And with high false negatives, people feel that they don't have the virus, and they go back out into the community and potentially continue the spread.  So "How available are PCR and antibody tests to the general public?" is probably the question I get more than any other.  Well, as of Monday, Johns Hopkins University's Covid Tracking Project was reporting over 7 million people in the United States have been tested. And they mean the diagnostic, or PCR test, in this case.  But again, the initial rollout of those tests was fraught with problems. And that caused major delays in the country's early response to the pandemic. Those problems are being addressed now, but there are still supply chain shortages.  The PCR test requires certain transport mediums, reagents and, yes, nasal swabs. And those things have been in short supply.  But just last week, the mayor of Los Angeles announced free diagnostic testing for all of the county's residents.  Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles: Because we know the 10 million residents in L.A. county need that. It's critical for us opening up in the future.  Gupta: That's Mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN.  Garcetti: And we wanted to be the first big city in America to take the advice of doctors around the country saying, "You have to find the silent spreaders. This is a silent killer," that people without symptoms who can spread this are a critical piece of knowledge in order to open up in the future.  Gupta: And in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city will produce its own Covid-19 test kits, in partnership with a 3D printing company.  Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City: We realized we had to find another source. The global market wasn't working. There weren't sources around this country that were reliable enough, so we decided we would make our own. And this has had to be put together very quickly. So we're really in uncharted territory creating these test kits in New York City.  Gupta: Again, it's these nasal swabs that have been in such short supply in so many places around the country.  Now there are also plenty of antibody tests floating around that haven't been reviewed or validated by the FDA. The agency said Monday that it was tightening its policy to keep unproven and even fraudulent tests from entering the market. It's been a big problem.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.  In one study of 12 antibody tests, four were shown to deliver false positive results more than 10% of the time. Remember, if you're testing for antibodies and you get a false positive, people may incorrectly assume they now have the antibodies and are protected and then go out into public and keep spreading. You really want to get that false positive rate under 2% -- as low as possible, really.  The future could lie in at-home testing. Antigen tests would be the easiest to mass-produce for home use. But again, like I said, we don't yet have a reliable antigen test for Covid-19.  White house coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx said this last month, on NBC's "Meet the Press."  Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator, White House Coronavirus Task Force: We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. We have to be able to detect antigens, rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself. And to really move into antigen testing.  Gupta: If an antigen test is approved and mass-produced, it may serve as a valuable screening tool, but it's probably not going to replace the PCR saliva or swab tests when it comes to diagnosing Covid-19. The antigen test in this case would just be used to screen. The PCR test would still be the most accurate.  According to The Guardian, scientists working for the U.S. military have designed a PCR test that has the potential to detect the virus as early as just 24 hours after it's contracted. That could help stop infected people from spreading the virus before they even show symptoms. And keep in mind, a lot of people never show symptoms but can still spread the virus. It's another promising "maybe."  And remember this: Testing does need to go hand in hand with contact tracing. Once you find out who is infected, that person needs to be isolated. And then everyone who has had close contact with that person needs to be traced. And sometimes those people need to be quaratined as well. Test, trace and hopefully treat.  My colleague Anderson Cooper and I asked Bill Gates about this at CNN's town hall last week.  Bill Gates, philanthropist: If you want to try and open up, this contact-tracing thing has got to be taken seriously. South Korea took it seriously. It looks like there's an effort in New York that [former] Mayor Bloomberg is helping out with that will do some of that. That's a necessary part of reopening is to have the quick turnaround tests that actually low-income people can get access to, but the contact tracing to follow up so those people hear very quickly if they've been infected.  Gupta: Things are getting better, but it is clear that we're still not where we need to be. It's a brutal truth, but one that needs to be told.  There aren't enough PCR or diagnostic tests to meet demand, and the antibody tests haven't been as accurate as they need to be. And this is exactly why I keep advising people to behave like you have the virus. A lack of tests means a lack of knowledge.  The availability of quicker, easier and more accurate testing is crucial to get the country back on its feet.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.
2020-05-05	Passengers wait in the departure hall of the high speed train station in Hong Kong on January 23. Kin Cheung/AP  A new genetic analysis of the virus that causes Covid-19 taken from more than 7,600 patients around the world shows the virus has been circulating in people since late last year, and must have spread extremely quickly after the first infection.  Researchers in Britain looked at mutations in the virus and found evidence of quick spread, but not evidence the virus is becoming more easily transmitted or more likely to cause serious disease.  “The virus is changing, but this in itself does not mean it’s getting worse,” genetics researcher Francois Balloux of the University College London Genetics Institute told CNN.  Balloux and colleagues pulled viral sequences from a giant global database that scientists around the world are using to share data. They looked at samples taken at different times and from different places, and said they indicate that the virus first started infecting people at the end of last year.  “This rules out any scenario that assumes SARSCoV-2 may have been in circulation long before it was identified, and hence have already infected large proportions of the population,” Balloux’s team wrote in their report, published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.  “Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host,” the team wrote in the report, published Tuesday.  “It’s very recent,” Balloux said. “We are really, really, really confident that the host jump happened late last year.”  They also found genetic evidence that supports suspicions the virus was infecting people in Europe, the US and elsewhere weeks or even months before the first official cases were reported in January and February.  Balloux’s team had their findings reviewed by other experts, a process called peer review, before they were published in the journal. He said some reports by other teams, published online in on what are called pre-print websites, may have drawn incorrect conclusions.
2020-05-05	(CNN) In an interview on Monday with the New York Post , President Donald Trump was asked about his contentious relationship with the media -- particularly CBS News' Paula Reid. Here's how he responded:  "It wasn't Donna Reed, I can tell you that. ... Paula Reid, she's sitting there and I say, 'How angry. I mean, What's the purpose?' They're not even tough questions, but you see the attitude of these people, it's like incredible."  In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!  For large swaths of Americans -- aka anyone who wasn't watching movies and TV between 1940 and 1965 -- the reference simply flew over their collective head. Reed, who most famously played Mary Bailey in the 1946 Christmas classic "It's a Wonderful Life," and then went on to star in her own black-and-white TV sitcom through the mid-1960s, died in 1986. Which was 34 years ago.  Trump's tendency to draw on cultural touchstones from decades ago is not new. He's more likely cite the Bobbsey Twins than the Olsen twins (Mary-Kate and Ashley, obvi!). It's also not unimportant. Because Trump's old-timey references reflect his broader desire for that moment in American culture.  When asked during the 2016 race the last time he believed America was "great," Trump said in an interview with The New York Times , "I would say during the 1940s and the late '40s and '50s we started getting, we were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody, we had just won a war, we were pretty much doing what we had to do, yeah around that period."  Trump is, quite literally, stuck -- in his cultural references, in his policies, in his worldview and, yes, even in what he eats -- in that moment. (Trump was born in 1946.) As Axios' Jim VandeHei noted in a 2018 piece headlined " Donald Trump, a 1950s man :"  "In this era of drones and driverless cars, President Trump often sounds and feels like a man from the bygone days of station wagons and smokestacks ...  "... Even his diet and health routine are retro: golfing as exercise (with a cart), and a diet heavy on burgers and thick steaks."  Trump's public comments -- both on the campaign trail and as president -- are rife with evidence of his longing to return to what he considers the golden era of America.  * At a rally in Colorado Springs earlier this year, Trump criticized the fact that "Parasite" -- a South Korean film with English subtitles -- had won the Oscar for "Best Picture." Said the President : "What the hell was that all about? We've got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of that, they give them best movie of the year. Was it good? I don't know. ... Can we get like 'Gone with the Wind' back please? 'Sunset Boulevard,' so many great movies."  "Gone with the Wind" came out in 1939 -- portraying an idealized version of the American South during Reconstruction. "Sunset Boulevard" is slightly more current; it premiered in 1950.  * At a briefing by the White House coronavirus task force in mid-April, Trump said this : "And we have -- this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it's a World Health or World Trade. And they're like -- I call them the 'Bobbsey Twins.'" The Bobbsey twins were two sets of fraternal twins who got into all sorts of mixed-up adventures but, in the end, things wound up working out for them! The first book in the series came out in 1904.  * Of former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Trump told Politico in 2019 that "Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States." "Alfred E. Neuman" was a fictional character who served as a sort-of mascot for the satirical Mad magazine. He was first on the cover of the mag in -- you guessed it! -- the mid-1950s when Mad tried to make him a write-in candidate for president. (If you care at all about the history of "Alfred E. Neuman, read this amazing piece in the Paris Review .)  That the President is a product of the time in which he grew up isn't terribly surprising. (Heck, I make "Teen Wolf" and "Simpsons" references constantly!) What is surprising -- and scary -- is that Trump seems to not understand that his idyllic picture of the 1950s wasn't all that idyllic for people who weren't white men like him.  It was in 1955 that Rosa Parks refused to sit at the back of the bus. The "March on Washington" didn't come until 1963. Ditto the "Equal Pay Act." In 1961, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality  You get the idea. America was great for white males in the 1950s -- and not great for pretty much everyone. Trump either can't -- or won't -- see that element of the time period that he clearly longs for, and which he is, mentally speaking, still stuck in. During that time, women were largely staying at home, cooking meals for their husbands and taking care of their kids. Not, say, asking tough questions at White House press briefings.  CBS reporter Paula Reid responded to Trump's comments in a tweet Tuesday : "President Trump tells @nypost I am nothing like 50's American archetypal mom Donna Reed. Fact-check: True."  "The messages it sent out were positive and uplifting. The folks you saw were likable, the family was fun, the situations were familiar to people. It provided 22-and-a-half-minutes of moral instruction and advice on how to deal with the little dilemmas of life."  The" folks you saw" were also white . All of them. And Reed played a housewife happily married to a doctor. They had two kids -- a boy and a girl. Again, you get the picture.  Trump's vision of America's future is heavily tinged with this nostalgia for a time -- the 1950s -- that simply was not the paradise that believes it to be. That he can't see that is a deeply problematic blind spot.
2020-05-06	Seoul (CNN Business) Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong says he will not be handing the company's management over to his children.  The billionaire Samsung vice chairman, who is the son of former chairman Lee Kun-hee, made the announcement at a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday.  "I do not plan to pass down my role to my children," the younger Lee, who is also known as Jay Y. Lee, told reporters.  "This is something I have thought about for a long time but have been hesitant to express openly. It was because not only is the business environment difficult, but I felt it would be irresponsible to speak on succession issues when I myself have not been properly proven yet," he added. His father was left incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014.  Samsung is South Korea's biggest conglomerate. Its combined businesses are estimated to account for around 15% of the country's entire economy. Samsung Electronics, the biggest part of the group, is the world's leading smartphone maker and a vital supplier of memory chips and display screens.  Read More
2020-05-06	Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images  US President Trump has again leveled accusations that China could have stopped the global coronavirus pandemic, calling the spread "the worst attack we've ever had on our country."  Speaking from the Oval Office today, the President went on to say, "This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center."  What we know: So far, more than 71,000 people in America have died from coronavirus. In comparison, more than 2,000 Americans were killed in the Pearl Harbor bombings during World War II. On September 11, 2001, a total of 2,977 people were killed in New York City, Washington, DC and outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  But while Pearl Harbor and 9/11 were direct and targeted attacks on the United States, the coronavirus pandemic is impacting countries all over the world, including in China. As of today, Johns Hopkins University puts China's death toll from the virus at 4,637.  There's never been an attack like this," Trump said today in the Oval.  The President added: "And it should have never happened. Could have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China. It should have been stopped right at the source. And it wasn't."  In recent days, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have doubled down on the assertion that the virus originated from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December.  The claim has unsurprisingly drawn fierce rebuttal from the Chinese government, which described the accusation as "smear" intended to bolster Trump's reelection chances.  Intelligence shared among the Five Eyes network — an alliance between United States and the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada — also reportedly appears to contradict the Trump administration's assertion.  Trump's recent displeasure with China are a far cry from his past statements on the nation and its leader, Xi Jinping, whom he earlier praised for his transparency and management of the outbreak.  Last month, CNN identified at least 37 separate instances where Trump praised China since January, including one as recent as April 1. (Here is a timeline of those remarks.)  As recently has last month, Trump was touting his administration's trade deal with China during a White House coronavirus task force briefing. The president said the relationship with China is "very good" and the "biggest communication" is between himself and President Xi.  "So, look, the relationship with China is a good one, and my relationship with him is, you know, really good," Trump said on April 1.  Watch here:  ##Health#
2020-05-06	Some retails stores in Los Angeles will be able to open starting Friday, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in a news conference Wednesday.  Garcetti said he plans to modify the safer at home order in the city of Los Angeles.  Florists, toy stores, music stores, book stores, clothing stores and sporting goods stores in Los Angeles may offer curbside pickup, he said. Car dealerships will also be able to open.  Some context: This is in line with what Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said in an earlier news conference.  He clarified that stores will only able to offer curbside pickup and that people will not able to go inside the stores.  Starting Saturday, the city will open its trails, parks and golf courses.  Face coverings will be required at all city trails and golf courses, Garcetti said. Runyon canyon will remain closed.  Friday May 8 marks the beginning of phase two, a slow and gradual loosening of some of the restrictions, he said.
2020-05-07	We are publishing personal essays from CNN's global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Ivan Watson is a senior international correspondent for CNN in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong (CNN) "Can we take our masks off?" I ask, as my bride and I get into position.  "You may," responds a Hong Kong official, who is still wearing his mask.  Moments later, Rana and I exchange rings, sign government documents, and share a brief kiss. Amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, Rana and I have just gotten married.  On the other side of the planet, our families and friends in the US, Lebanon and elsewhere watch the little civil ceremony in Hong Kong streamed live on Instagram, sprinkling the video with hearts and emojis and other social media expressions of happiness.  Family and friends tune in to watch the wedding via livestream. Photo: Rana Wehbe Watson  Before leaving the wedding registry, we put on his and hers surgical masks adorned with the titles "Mr." and "Mrs."  This was not what we expected, when I first asked her to marry me on a freezing night in New York City last December.  At the time, we were both jet-lagged after the long flight from Hong Kong, where we live and work. We were also deliriously happy, posing in front of a glowing fountain alongside my sister and brother-in-law, who conspired with me to take surprise photos of the occasion.  Basking in that happy moment, we had little clue that a deadly new strain of pneumonia had just been discovered in a city called Wuhan in China -- and the next four and a half months of our lives became our Engagement with Coronavirus.  Ivan proposed to Rana in New York City on December 21, 2019. Photo: Anya Hanson  Neither of us are strangers to crisis.  Rana grew up in Beirut in a civil war. At a young age, she suffered the loss of her father, one of many tragic victims of that conflict.  While my childhood was much more comfortable, 20 years of reporting overseas exposed me to the grim realities of war, natural disaster and political instability.  Still, neither of us had ever been confronted by a modern-day plague of global proportions.  The wake-up call came at the end of January, when the Hong Kong administration canceled schools, shut down public recreation centers and issued work-from-home orders to civil servants. The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan had spread across China, and the first cases had been detected in the semi-autonomous cities of Hong Kong and Macau.  Hong Kongers didn't mess around. Immediately, the whole city started wearing masks.  We did too, when we went to the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registrations Office in early February to apply for a date to get married.  Rana and Ivan at Hong Kong's Births, Deaths and Marriages Registrations Office on February 9. Photo: Ivan Watson  Friends and family back home called to express concern about our health. But they spoke about the epidemic as if it was some distant threat, an "Asian" problem that would never reach their shores.  As Rana became more and more worried, I remained naively optimistic -- until a reporting assignment in South Korea at the end of February.  At that stage, South Korea had the most confirmed coronavirus cases outside mainland China. In early March, thousands of Koreans were testing positive on a daily basis. Governments increasingly imposed international flight restrictions. Seemingly overnight, my hotel in Seoul became eerily empty.  On March 10, the only way to get from South Korea back home to Hong Kong was to fly absurdly long distances via London. On the flight from South Korea, CNN cameraman Tom Booth and I were shocked to see British Airways crews operating without any protection. No one checked our temperature during the layover at London's Heathrow Airport. Britain apparently behaved as if this deadly disease wasn't happening.  Upon arrival in Hong Kong, health authorities put me on two-week mandatory medical surveillance. I was to check my temperature twice daily and report immediately if I came down with symptoms. Though authorities advised against it, Rana insisted on staying by my side throughout the 14 days. Fortunately, neither of us got sick.  Making the best of it  Then, throughout March, Covid-19 spread like wildfire across the Middle East, Europe and North America. Suddenly, Rana and I were far more worried about our parents in the US and Lebanon, than we were for ourselves in Hong Kong.  For two people who have lived almost all of our adult lives overseas, a sickening realization set in -- we could no longer count on jumping on a plane to fly home to our loved ones in the event of an emergency.  Yet amid the anxiety and fear, a silver lining emerged.  In this pandemic, we had each other. Social isolation meant a pause in business travel and long work deployments.  Rana dons a mask for a wedding dress fitting. Photo: Rana Wehbe Watson  With our little rescue cat, our small family settled in for weeks of working from home in pajamas followed by cozy home-cooked dinners.  The coronavirus forced us to stop and count our blessings. The entire world has been taught a giant lesson in humility, a reminder that we are subject to forces and events that we cannot control. Nothing -- neither our health, the roof over our heads, nor the food on our table -- can be taken for granted.  At the same time, life must go on.  "After all, your grandparents got married during World War II," my mom pointed out.  She is very right. My grandparents, two refugees from the civil war in Russia, started a family amid the horrors of Nazi-occupied France.  Compare that to me and Rana, who spent much of our engagement on the couch watching "Tiger King" (among other things).  Ivan is fitted for his wedding suit. Photo: Rana Wehbe Watson  So far, we have had it so easy. A week before the wedding, however, disaster struck. Rana's 84-year old grandmother suffered a stroke. She was taken to intensive care in Beirut and had brain surgery.  There was nothing we could do. Even if there was some way to fly to Lebanon, Rana would not dare exposing her family if she picked up an illness on the plane.  Thankfully, Rana's teta stabilized after the operation. She's a tough lady.  Finally, our wedding day arrived in May. We wore surgical masks with "bride" and "groom" written on them in marker to the registry.  Ivan puts a surgical mask on new bride Rana. Photo: Keith Richburg  The city's coronavirus guidelines allow up to 20 guests at a wedding. We had eight.  There is no time for vows to be exchanged during the 15-minute civil ceremony -- although in some ways, we didn't need them.  After our engagement with coronavirus, we know we will be there for each other, no matter what the future may bring.
2020-05-07	Gary Cohn, former economic adviser to President Trump, said he's optimistic about the future of the US economy.  "We are going to recover. We are going to put people back to work. And we're going to do it rather quickly," Cohn told CNN's Erin Burnett. "I would not underestimate the strength and the recovery of this economy."  Cohn noted that the economy may look different in a post-coronavirus world, and may feature different types of employment.  "We will be very clever and very creative at creating new jobs and new opportunities in our economy," he said.  Despite his optimism, however, Cohn does not concur with the President's assessment that the United States is going "to have an incredible next year" economically.  "I think it's going to take longer than 12 months for us to evolve to where we're comfortable," Cohn said. "Unless something miraculously happens in the medical field and we get a vaccine... it's going to take some period of time."

2020-05-07	(CNN) Acrobatic one-handed catches, bone-crunching tackles and toe-tapping touchdowns in the end zone -- that's what the NFL is teasing as it unveils the 2020 NFL regular season schedule at 8 p.m. E.T. today on the NFL Network.  While all of the major sports leagues have been put on hold or delayed indefinitely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the NFL is pushing forward, fully hopeful the season will kick off as usual on September 10.  "We're just moving forward as we would normally do, until the medical community tells us that we need to make an adjustment," Troy Vincent, league executive vice president of football operations, told CNN.  What's happening tonight?  Hosted on the NFL Network, through the NFL app and on NFL.com, the network will be breaking down the entire upcoming 2020 NFL regular season schedule. That means we'll know when and where all 256 regular season games will be played.  Who will the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs host on opening night? Will we get to see Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson square off? Who will rookie quarterback Joe Burrow play in his first game with the Cincinnati Bengals?  The three-hour show will answer all of our matchup questions and go division by division and analyze the most anticipated matchups and primetime games.  NFL head coaches, general managers and other guests will also be interviewed via video conferencing throughout the show.  Will the season actually work out? Experts aren't so sure  A lot can change in four months, but the US has been woefully unprepared for the spread of the coronavirus. Experts say it's unlikely to be contained by September.  Four months may seem like an eternity as people across the country are isolating at home for most hours of the day, but there are still a lot of hurdles to clear before sports can return.  Vincent outlined the concerns the NFL is planning for  "Here are the number of people that can go back into the facility. Here's the processes that you have in place. So, public safety first. Safety of personnel. Safety of the players. That all comes first," he told CNN. "So, we literally have been guided on a daily basis, making the adjustments on a daily basis as the science and the medical community tells us to do so."  Former Centers Disease for Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the pandemic response on Wednesday that as bad as things seem now, he thinks we're still in the beginning phases of the pandemic.  Experts John Barry and Marc Lipsitch co-authored a new report that predicts that the coronavirus pandemic could last up to two more years, and they warn that the situation could get "considerably worse than what we've seen so far."  "I would love to be able to have all sports back," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with The New York Times published last week. "But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we're not ready for that yet."  "Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything," the doctor added. "If you can't guarantee safety, then unfortunately you're going to have to bite the bullet and say, 'We may have to go without this sport for this season.'"  The NFL has more challenges than other leagues  The NFL announced that it would cancel all planned international games and that all upcoming games will be played in the US. The league had previously been planning to play four games in London and one game in Mexico City.  The league said that it decided to cancel all international games in order to ensure that all games are played under consistent stadium protocols to ensure player and personnel safety.  The Korean Baseball Organization showed the world what live sports will look like in the pandemic: no spectators watching from the stands and a lack of in-person energy from the players.  However, unlike the US, South Korea was aggressive with testing and was able to quickly flatten the curve and limit the spread of the virus.  The US has lagged considerably behind other advanced nations on testing , and in order for the league to even entertain the idea of getting players on the field, it must have adequate testing available for players and personnel.  Players and personnel must be tested before they're allowed to enter any facilities or come in contact with anyone else, and everyone must take extra precautions everywhere they go.  The NBA and MLB have discussed scenarios that would involve quarantining players and personnel in a city, and shuttling them back and forth to hotels and games in order to minimize outside contact. They would also restrict access for anyone that enters facilities or comes in contact with players and personnel.  However, unless players are able to bring their family or loved ones with them, that scenario remains a remote possibility, as it is unlikely that everyone would sign off on being separated from their families for months.  Such a scenario would be even more challenging for the NFL, considering how large its rosters and personnel are compared to other sports.  For a full-contact sport, the NFL must take even more precautions. MLB has an advantage in that there is very little contact in the sport. The NFL also has a full season ahead of them, whereas leagues such as the NBA and NHL were partially through their seasons with the postseason only weeks away.  As much as we would all love to dream about the NFL actually kicking off on September 10, that reality is far from certain.
2020-05-07	Former US Vice President Al Gore said that President Donald Trump and his administration have failed to properly handle the Covid-19 pandemic.  "He has failed as president. Particularly on this challenge. The warnings were ignored," Gore said during CNN's global town hall.  Gore said when he was vice president, he began every day with a report from the intelligence community and:  "There were very few occasions where there was a stark warning about grave danger to the country, and whenever there was such an occasion, we stopped and said hold the show. Get the FBI, get the CIA, get whoever was involved over, we need to learn about this," Gore explained.  Gore said he believes Trump both missed the warnings and "failed to mobilize the resources of the federal government to straighten out this testing catastrophe, to get swabs, and the so-called re-agents they need to do the tests, and the gowns, and masks, and all of the other stuff."  Reopening too soon: Gore also said he's concerned the country is not ready to reopen.  "I think we are seeing the start of a botched reopening," he said.  Trump, Gore said, "may be recklessly rolling the dice hoping that he can goose the economy just enough in the third quarter of this year to enhance his reelection prospects, hoping that he can divert the blame for the extra tens of thousands of Americans who the doctors tell us will die as a result of this, and blame it on the Chinese or former President Obama or whoever, instead of doing what a president needs to do."

2020-05-07	(CNN) Education is being reshaped around the globe in response to the coronavirus and how easily it can spread.  In other countries, some schools are reopening classrooms. Here is how some of those schools look, which could provide clues for how we think our children will, one day, resume their education.  Staggered returns  In South Korea, students won't all return at once. Third-year high school students will start back next week so they can make career and college decisions, Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said.  Middle schools, elementary schools and kindergartens will be open by June 1, Yoo said.  New schedules  Students are back in their classroom at the Marie Curie school in Hanoi, but online teaching will also continue.  Most of Vietnam's 22 million students returned to class Monday, after a monthslong closure, according to state media Vietnam News Agency (VNA).  But online and televised classes will continue with new schedules and reduced in-person teaching, the report said.  In Austria, students will split into two cohorts to attend school every other day to allow for distancing, Education Minister Heinz Fassmann said, according to reports.  Smaller classes  Israel is beginning a phased return over the next few weeks and setting a maximum limit of 17 students in each classroom.  An Israeli teacher welcomes students back to class along with new measures to prevent coronavirus spread.  The Ministry of Education told CNN that attendance was about 60% in the schools that did open earlier this week, possibly a sign that parents were nervous about sending their children back.  Spaced-out desks  Denmark, which was one of the first nations in Europe to close shops, restaurants and schools, , which was one of the first nations in Europe to close shops, restaurants and schools, has welcomed children back to class  Desks are placed so students sit at least 2 meters or 6 feet apart.  Lunch in classrooms  Schools in Denmark are also having children eat lunch in their classrooms to avoid students gathering in larger groups.

2020-05-07	Wall Street is buzzing about another unusual move in financial markets.  Futures contracts on Thursday began pricing in a slightly negative fed funds rate in early 2021 from the Federal Reserve.  At face value, that suggests investors believe the Fed will take President Trump's advice and embrace the subzero rates adopted by Europe and Japan.  Yet analysts told CNN Business the Fed funds market move -- coming just weeks after crude oil futures went negative for the first time ever -- should be taken with a grain of salt. They blamed technical factors such as low liquidity and investor positioning.  “There’s some weirdness going on in that market. It went silly,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital.  Plus, though the Fed dropped rates to zero in March to fight the coronavirus crisis, the central bank's officials aren't fans of negative interest rates -- which critics say have done more harm than good.  “A straight read tells you the market expects the Fed will take rates negative. I fundamentally disagree with that view," said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America.  Then again, few imagined in January the Fed would be back at zero and buying unlimited amounts of bonds. Yet here we are.
2020-05-07	This analysis was excerpted from the May 7 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.  (CNN) It's too early to compare how different countries are handling Covid-19, said Boris Johnson earlier this week -- the UK Prime Minister whose country just overtook Italy as the place with the most known deaths in Europe.  This is a rare crisis that all nations, regardless of geography and political systems, are facing simultaneously. Comparisons aren't exact, given quirks of epidemiology, population density and different standards for tallying infections. But lessons from standout leaders could help those at the bottom of the class.  Elsewhere, the emergency revealed governments' weaknesses. The "one country, two systems" principle bore fruit for Hong Kong, which contained the virus but put to shame the mainland, where the Communist Party's paranoia slowed its response. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban exploited the crisis to seize near-dictatorial powers. And Russia's Vladimir Putin may be a grandmaster in geopolitical chess, but his domestic crisis management was again exposed as shaky.  Here in the US, the virus magnified President Donald Trump's liabilities -- knee-jerk denial, spreading misinformation, spouting snake-oil treatments and blaming foreigners. There is good and bad in the US federal system, which does well in elevating local leaders but brews clashes between the states and Washington.  Read More
2020-05-07	(CNN) New data from the Trump administration shows few passengers were stopped in initial screenings of international flights from early coronavirus hotspots outside of China, prompting Democrats to question whether the first phase of the administration's effort to stem the spread of the outbreak was effective in ferreting out potential cases.  Passenger screenings at Italian airports resulted in just 13 passengers being stopped from boarding flights to the US from Rome in the first two weeks in March, after the US announced all passengers from Italy would receive health screenings due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to data provided to the House Oversight Committee. And there were no passengers stopped from boarding flights to the US from Milan, Italy, the epicenter of Italy's initial coronavirus outbreak, from March 3 through March 14, when stricter travel restrictions for Europe were put in place.  In South Korea, 56 passengers were stopped from boarding inbound flights, including 25 by Korean Air from February 28 through March 10, according to the government's data.  The screenings at airports in South Korea and Italy, which were two of the early coronavirus global hotspots, are one of several air travel-related issues Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are investigating as part of their examination of the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak and whether there were missed steps that could have limited the virus' spread in the US.  It's hard to determine the ultimate impact of those screenings. It's not clear how they may have stemmed the spread of coronavirus in the US, and it's unknown how many travelers with positive cases, if any, may have slipped through foreign airports. On March 3, there were 122 confirmed positive cases in the US. By March 14, when the European travel restrictions went into effect, the number had grown to more than 2,800.  In mid-February, CNN reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had screened more than 30,000 passengers on flights from China, but not a single US coronavirus case had been caught by the airport temperature checks.  Vice President Mike Pence announced on March 3 that 100% of passengers coming from Italy and South Korea would receive health screenings in those countries before traveling to the US, saying the administration had not yet concluded it needed to conduct additional testing at US airports.  "At this moment, as of this morning, the screening is taking place and it is -- multiple-layered screening is taking place in those countries, in cooperation and coordination with us," Pence said. "We did have a discussion today with Homeland Security officials, and they are preparing recommendations to the President regarding screening on our end if we determine that that is also necessary."  But the committee raised concerns about how stringently the screenings were conducted in Italy and South Korea after receiving several letters from travelers returning from those counties, who were concerned about a lack of health screenings. Several wrote in the letters, which were reviewed by CNN, that they received no temperature screenings at airports in Italy and US officials asked no questions about their health or travel to high-risk counties when they returned to the US.  Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who chairs the Oversight subcommittee conducting the investigation, questioned why passengers were not screened at US airports when they arrived from Italy and South Korea, just like those who returned from Wuhan, China.  "After imposing a travel ban and enacting health screenings for travel from China at the start of February, the President told us they had everything under control," Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. "Yet, the administration did little else to stop the inflow of the virus through our airports until mid-March, and it disregarded valuable opportunities to slow the spread through enhanced entry screenings."  The State Department told the committee that US officials in both South Korea and Italy monitored the screenings and were in "close contact" with airport authorities to ensure the screenings took place.  "The Italian government welcomed passenger-screening guidelines provided by the United States and voluntarily performed the screening, keeping Embassy Rome and Consulate General Milan officials updated," the State Department wrote in written answers to the committee, which were obtained by CNN.  In addition to the screenings, the committee is scrutinizing the long lines that emerged at US airports after the European travel restrictions were put in place, where passengers returning to the US were waiting for hours -- and not social distancing -- to go through customs and immigration.  The committee said it was briefed by officials from Customs and Border Protection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department. The administration officials told the panel they did not recall conversations about putting social distancing measures as they set up the screening procedures, saying they "expected a large load" of Americans returning and were focused on being staffed sufficiently "to process the people."  Officials at Homeland Security and CDC did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on the committee's findings. A State Department spokesperson said the US has "enjoyed close coordination" with South Korea and Italy on combating coronavirus, including the screening of US-bound passengers.  At US airports in early March, Customs and Border Protection agents were told to review travel advisories from countries including Italy and South Korea, and refer those exhibiting symptoms for an additional health screenings. The Trump administration told the committee that "just under 1,500" returning passengers from travel-restricted countries from January 17 through March 29 were referred to the CDC for public health screenings, out of the roughly 250,000 passengers screened by DHS' Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. About one in 10 passengers had their temperatures checked during the same time period, the DHS office told the panel, saying that was its informal policy.  The Trump administration announced that screenings would occur for airline travelers in South Korea and Italy on March 3, as the virus spread across the globe from its origin in Wuhan, China, and the number of cases in both Italy and South Korea spiked.  The State Department told the House panel that South Korea had begun implementing its own temperature screenings on February 28. On March 5, temperature screenings were instituted at Seoul's Incheon airport for all passengers entering the departure hall, the security checkpoint and at the boarding gate. South Korea also added a health questionnaire for US-bound passengers on March 11, according to State.  "While we generally find (Korean) authorities credible on matters such as this, our US embassy in (South Korea) repeatedly sent staff to Incheon International Airport in Seoul to physically inspect the measures" that were being taken, the State Department wrote. US Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris also visited the airport, according to State.  While the CDC had officials in South Korea in early March, the committee said, the CDC was not on the ground in Italy to observe the screenings. Instead, the State Department said Italian officials were in "constant communication" with the US Embassy in Rome as the outbreak spread, and officials from the US embassy and consulate in Milan visited the airports to observe the screenings.  The State Department told the committee US officials verified that the screening "was being properly undertaken in strict accordance with the guidelines."  "Embassy and consulate general officials performed multiple follow-up visited and verified screening was preceding comprehensively and efficiently," State told the oversight panel.  From February 28 through March 10, State said that the Korean government reported 56 passengers were denied boarding: United Airlines barred five passengers, Delta denied boarding to 16 passengers and Korean Air had taken the strictest approach and denied boarding to 25 passengers.  In Italy, four passengers were stopped from boarding a flight at Rome's Fiumicino airport on March 5, and nine passengers were barred from boarding on March 9, State said. No passengers were stopped from Milan's Malpensa airport as a result of the screening, the department said.  This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

2020-05-08	(CNN) Son Heung-min's eye for a goal is well known -- the Tottenham Hotspur star was this week voted to have scored the Premier League goal of the season -- and he's put that 20/20 vision to good use as he completed his military service in South Korea.  The Spurs forward scored 10 out of 10 on the shooting range as he finished the three-week program top of all 157 trainees and was one of five to receive a prize at the graduation ceremony, according to Korea's Yonhap News Agency  You're in the army now .. Son Heung-min excelled in the live fire drill at a Marine Corps boot camp.  The 27-year-old, who captains his national team, avoided military conscription in 2018 after winning the Asian Games with South Korea, but exempt athletes are still required by law to undertake four weeks of national service, or three weeks with the Marine Corps.  "He received the 'Pilsung' prize which is one of five types of awards for best performers," a Marine Corps officer told Yonhap. "All the courses were judged in a fair and strict manner, and his military training officers have said he went through the training faithfully."  Pilsung means 'certain victory,' something which has eluded Tottenham this season.  Read More
2020-05-08	(CNN) Life as we know it in much of the world has been turned upside down by the coronavirus. But two countries have been widely held up as examples of how to handle a pandemic: South Korea and Germany .  Their approaches were markedly different -- but each is now in the enviable position of being able to ease restrictions imposed to quash the spread of coronavirus with some confidence that infections won't immediately spike again.  So how are they preparing to return to "normal" life? In one word: Cautiously. And those watching enviously from other countries may notice that much remains far from normal.  South Korea -- which in February had the largest outbreak outside of China -- used a combination of widespread testing, aggressive contact tracing, stern public health measures and digital technology to contain the coronavirus without having to impose a widespread lockdown. It also maintained a strict quarantine regime.  People relax at the Cheonggye Stream in the South Korean capital, Seoul, on Thursday amid a lifting of restrictions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  Thanks to these measures, newly diagnosed cases have slowed to a trickle and the national death toll stood at 256 as of Friday, according to its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Against that backdrop, the South Korean government on Wednesday started to relax its strict social distancing rules, imposed on March 22, but only in line with a set of guidelines referred to as the "distancing in daily life" policy.  According to these guidelines, people should stay at home if they become sick with suspected Covid-19 symptoms, continue to keep a distance of 2 meters (6 feet) from others, wash their hands for 30 seconds and keep rooms well ventilated and disinfected regularly. Those aged over 65 and in high-risk groups should continue to stay home and avoid enclosed and crowded spaces.  As the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated, the policy "should not be interpreted as implying a return to 'normalcy' as before the outbreak but rather as an effort to achieve both infectious disease prevention/control and everyday life."  Cheerleaders pose in front of a big screen displaying baseball fans cheering from their homes during the opening game of South Korea's new baseball season between the SK Wyverns and Hanwha Eagles at Munhak Baseball Stadium in Incheon on Tuesday.  In line with this, South Korea's baseball season resumed Tuesday -- but with games played in empty stadiums, while umpires and base coaches wore masks. In one game, instead of the ceremonial first pitch, there was a socially distant start as a boy in a big clear balloon walked from the mound to the catcher.  Children will start to return to school from May 13. Speaking Monday, South Korean education minister Yoo Eun-Hae told students what to expect in this new, post-coronavirus reality.  "As soon as you arrive at a class, you will need to wipe your desk while windows should be opened frequently," she said. "You will also be required to wear a mask except for at mealtimes and maintain double arm's length distance when you are on the move or are standing in line. You must remember these rules and we urge you keep them."  South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a briefing Sunday that closed facilities would reopen gradually and that events and gatherings would be allowed as long as they abide by disinfection guidelines.  "It is so refreshing and stress-relieving to finally be out," Ju Eun-song, a 32-year-old store sales assistant, told AFP news agency as the restrictions were eased Wednesday.  "As we wrap up social distancing, we're at a stage where people are getting used to daily life distancing," Jo Jae-hong, a 38-year-old businessman, told the news agency.  But the emergence Friday of more than a dozen new cases linked to an individual who visited three nightclubs in Seoul last weekend served as a warning of how quickly the virus can regain a foothold. Officials swiftly advised clubs and bars to close for the next month.  Dr. Peter Drobac, a global health expert at the Oxford Saïd Business School, believes that other governments' experiences indicate that a cautious approach is the right one.  "There's no strict recipe that will work elsewhere, but there is a set of principles," he told CNN by email.  "First, flatten the curve -- or better still, crush the curve -- until there is a sustained decrease in new cases. Opening up when you still have uncontrolled community spread, as in parts of the US, is lunacy."  Secondly, he said, countries must make sure their health system can cope without crisis measures and that health care workers have the necessary protective equipment; thirdly, massive testing capacity must be in place.  "Fourth, contact tracing -- which requires people and technology -- and a plan to isolate cases and quarantine contacts. Isolation should not be done at home! That's where the most transmission happens. I don't understand why this is being ignored in the UK and the US."  Lastly, high-risk and vulnerable groups must be protected, he said, as people's renewed mobility increases the risk of new infections.  "The key to reopening is to offset that risk with testing, tracing, and isolation," he said. "These are tried and true interventions that break chains of transmission. It doesn't mean you can get back to normal, but it increases the chances that you can start to open up safely."  Other countries can learn a lot from South Korea, he said.  "It's easy to talk about 'test, trace, isolate' but hard to do. When you look at the robustness of South Korea's response, it's a terrific set of lessons that can be replicated," Drobac said. "The other important factor in South Korea appears to be transparent communication and public trust. It's going to be harder in places where the response was mismanaged or politicized, like the US and UK."  Germans can 'afford courage'  Children respect social distancing rules as they enter the Petri primary school in Dortmund, western Germany, on Thursday, as the school reopens for some pupils.  Germany is also taking a step-by-step approach to reopening for business after a weeks-long lockdown.  Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germans on Wednesday that they could "afford a bit of courage," but cautioned that "we have to watch that this thing does not slip out of our hands."  Limits on social contact would remain in place until June 5, she said, but people can now meet with members of one other household as well as their own. People must still remain 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart and cover their mouths and noses in public.  Shops can reopen but with additional hygiene measures, Merkel added, speaking at a news conference following a video meeting with the prime ministers of Germany's 16 states. "The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time," Merkel said.  Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, will resume play from May 16 -- but under tight restrictions and without spectators. It will be the first major European league to return to action.  Germany's coronavirus response is widely seen as a success story in Europe. The country's Covid-19 death toll has stayed relatively low compared to other countries and its well-resourced health system allowed its hospitals to accept patients from other, more embattled, European countries. Germany's advanced diagnostics industry meant it was able to conduct mass testing from early on.  The coronavirus reproduction rate -- a crucial measure -- is estimated to have fallen to 0.65, the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said Thursday. That means that on average, 100 people will infect 65 others.  Currently, Germany is able to carry out 964,000 coronavirus tests per week, the RKI said, although only about one-third of that capacity was used in the past week.  Visitors wearing face masks walk through an exhibition at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt art museum Wednesday, on the first day the museum reopened to the public during the coronavirus crisis.  Germany's relatively cautious approach to reopening appears prudent, Drobac said.  "Daily new cases have dropped into the hundreds -- this is not trivial, but it's a level that can hopefully be managed with a strong system for testing, tracing and isolation," he said.  Germany's decentralized governance system, coupled with national coordination, means there is useful local flexibility to decide exactly how and when to ease social distancing recommendations, he said.  "Big cities may need to move more slowly than rural areas, for example. But importantly, Germany has instituted a trigger -- if new cases rise above 50 per 100,000, it automatically halts the easing of social distancing. I don't know if it will work, but it looks like a smart approach based on the evidence we have."  Lifting lockdown 'slowly but surely'  Elsewhere, urgent discussion continues on how to lift restrictions on people's lives and reboot the economy without jeopardizing the progress made in curtailing the spread of the coronavirus. And even as measures are eased, citizens face a very different reality.  In Italy, some 4 million people were allowed to return to work this week -- many of them construction and factory workers -- and Italians were again permitted to visit family members in the same region. Bars and restaurants reopened, but only for takeaway orders.  Government and church leaders also announced Thursday that masses and weddings could be celebrated in churches from May 18, after being banned for almost two months. But services will not look quite the same.  According to the protocol agreed by leaders, the priest and worshipers will have to wear masks. The priest will give communion wearing gloves and must be careful "avoiding any contact with the faithful's hands."  Worshipers will also have to maintain a one-meter (3-foot) distance from others, inside and outside the church, and anyone with a fever will not be admitted.  France will also begin lifting stay-at-home restrictions as of Monday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday. He said it would be a "very gradual process" in order to "slowly but surely" lift lockdown measures.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to give a televised address Sunday on his nation's restrictions. Newspaper headlines have suggested a significant relaxation is on the cards. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, hosting the daily Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street on Thursday, said any measures would only be "incremental" and "relatively modest."  Meanwhile, in the United States, while some press for a faster reopening of businesses hit hard by stay-at-home orders, others fear the peak of Covid-19 infections is still to come in certain states, or that a second wave of infections may be worse than the first.  Drobac cautions that the idea of choosing between prioritizing public health or the economy "is a fallacy."  "The only way to address the economic crisis is to address the public health crisis. Remember, a lockdown is not a solution -- it's an emergency stopgap that buys time to develop a strategy and prepare," he said.  "Right now there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little experiments happening around the world as countries and communities try to open back up. We will learn a lot from this period about what the new normal should look like for the next couple years."
2020-05-08	Former MLB star Alex Rodriguez says he hopes Major League Baseball will return in July despite the pandemic.  “I know that Major League Baseball officials are working around the clock,” Rodriguez told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “I think they will let science lead the way.”  The former Yankees star remains optimistic that Major League Baseball will return in the summer, but said it’s not just players that officials need to think about before the start of the season.  “There’s also coaches that are over 65,” he said. “There’s umpires. There’s kids that have asthma. So there’s a lot of variables and factors that are being considered that are not really being talked about. But I am still very hopeful and optimistic.”  Rodriguez continued to lay out what would need to occur for national baseball to return in the middle of a pandemic.  “The 30 owners and the players association have to come to an agreement on what is going to be the payment.,” he said. “Will there be additional concessions with those people in the stands, without any fans? And those are going to be big issues that are being talked about right now. After they come up with an agreement, hopefully July is the right time.”  Burnett discussed baseball games underway in Taiwan where fans are sitting apart from one another and in South Korea, where the stands are empty. Asked if the former MLB star could imagine playing without fans, Rodriguez said, “no.”  "The game is all about fans," Rodriguez said. "They’re the shareholders. They’re really owners of our game. We have the privilege to play, or manage or broadcast in my case now, but fans are a big part of it. The fans come out to the stadium, but they also watch at home. And America’s never been hungrier for sports and baseball. It is America’s favorite pastime, and I do think America needs its comfort food and that’s baseball."
2020-05-09	CDC Director Robert Redfield whispers to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn during a coronavirus task force briefing. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images  Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration will testify via videoconference at a Senate hearing about the coronavirus next week.  "I am grateful that White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, approved a one-time exception to the Administration’s policies about hearings, and has agreed that Dr. Hahn and Dr. Redfield will testify at this hearing by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances," said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate Health Committee.  The two officials will testify remotely after deciding to self-quarantine following a potential exposure to the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, is scheduled to testify at the same hearing.  CNN has reached out to Alexander’s staff to confirm whether Fauci will also testify remotely because he will be under a "modified quarantine" due to a potential exposure to the virus.
2020-05-09	Hong Kong (CNN) It's the bottom of the ninth inning. Kim Sang-su steps into the batter's box for the NC Dinos, who are down 4-0 to the Samsung Lions on Tuesday's opening day of the Korean Baseball Organization's (KBO) 2020 season.  This is the Dinos' final chance for a comeback. But play-by-play announcer Karl Ravech has disappeared.  Ravech, the host of ESPN's flagship MLB program "Baseball Tonight," is experiencing technical difficulties from his home in the northeast United States, where he's calling the game -- thousands of miles away from where it's actually taking place.  His partner in the virtual broadcast booth, longtime professional baseball player Eduardo Perez, takes the reins from his own home in the southeast of the country, filling in briefly before Ravech is able to return.  Ravech told viewers it was likely an internet dropout and to "be prepared, it might happen again."  That game was the first Korea baseball contest aired by ESPN as part of an agreement that will see the US sports network show six KBO games a week. Though the Dinos were able to get two players on base during the final frame, they failed to score and the Lions won the game.  Technical difficulties, like those experienced during Tuesday's broadcast, are just one of the many challenges ESPN faces in its first major attempt to air live sports since professional sports in the United States paused play indefinitely amid the coronavirus pandemic. The network is betting that Americans are craving live sports enough to follow an unfamiliar league halfway around the world.  "I think there was an absolute hunger and desire to watch live sports programming," Ravech said. "This is the time of year where baseball is played. And if you can provide that meal to a hungry audience, they're going to eat it."  Though some states are beginning to reopen and lift lockdowns, the United States is still in the throes of its battle against the virus, where 1.3 million people have been infected and 78,000 have died.  But countries that have been able to flatten the curb are starting to bring competition back online.  Taiwanese baseball started last month without fans. South Korea's league began this week.  As the rate of new infections slows in Germany, the Bundesliga is gearing up to come back -- a move that will likely put pressure on the rest of European soccer to follow suit when specific countries are ready.  Australia's National Rugby League is on track to resume play on May 28 . And the Australian Football League could follow in June, if the country's cases continue to decline and people continue to follow social distancing, f ederal Sports Minister Richard Colbeck said this week.  For sports fans around the world, these events offer a semblance of a return to normalcy. For those in the US and other countries struggling to contain the pandemic, the return of sports like the KBO offers fans something to satisfy their live sports cravings as well as a picture of what other sports might look like when they eventually resume.  "I think this is a blueprint and a template for the future," Ravech said. "That may be short-term, but the know-how now and the awareness that it can be done this way has, I imagined, opened up some eyes about the feasibility of continuing this."  The SK Wyverns and the Hanwha Eagles play in an empty SK Happy Dream Ballpark on Tuesday, which was opening day for the Korean Baseball League.  A vigilant response and careful steps forward  The empty stands at Samsung Lions Park in the southern city of Daegu and the Korean-language jerseys were omnipresent reminders that Tuesday's game was not the national pastime as Americans know it.  But it was still baseball. It may not have been Major League Baseball, but the game itself was largely the same minus a few minor differences in rules and regulations. Hearing Ravech's dulcet tones and Perez's insightful commentary during the game were reassuring, comforting and familiar for baseball fans who tune in to ESPN to follow the majors.  But it will likely be some of the only baseball fans in the United States can enjoy for some time, because the MLB does not appear close to ready to start its season.  The league has floated a plan to sequester all 30 teams in Arizona and play games there without fans, but it's not clear if that is feasible. There are major logistical hurdles from testing capacity to housing all 30 teams, and several players told ESPN they are not crazy about the idea of being sequestered away from their families in the middle of a pandemic.  "We have tried to be cautious about trying to go too soon, based on what the public health situation is," MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. "I think it's incumbent upon us to turn over every stone to try to play the game in 2020 if there's any way we can in the environment."  Hanwha Eagles players wear masks before the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League opening game between SK Wyverns and Hanwha Eagles.  South Korea's league is starting because, unlike the US, the country largely has its outbreak under control. Public health experts have hailed Seoul's strategy, which emphasizes rapid and widespread testing and thorough contact tracing, as one of the most effective responses to the virus on the planet  The numbers speak for themselves. To date, South Korea has recorded only 10,840 coronavirus patients and 256 fatalities. However, the capital of Seoul is cutting trying to contain a cluster of cases connected with nightclubs in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district in the capital.  But the KBO is still putting in place a host of measures to keep people safe. Players and team personnel must wash their hands or use hand sanitizer often and undergo frequent temperature checks. Almost everyone will be required to wear masks and gloves, except when in the dugout or on the field.  Players and team personnel are being asked to stay 2 meters (6.6 feet) away from others in locker rooms, showers and the dugout -- a difficult task considering it's a small space. High-fiving and spitting are discouraged.  There are plans to bring fans back eventually, though they will have their temperature checked and be required to a wear mask, a league official said.  The league is also putting contingency plans in place in case a player gets sick. If a player begins showing symptoms after the league starts, they'll be quarantined. But others will continue playing.  If a player tests positive, their close contacts will be self-quarantined for 14 days and the league will review if it needs to be suspended or not.  SK Wyverns cheerleaders at club's Happy Dream Ballpark during the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League opening game Tuesday.  440 coronavirus cases and recorded just six deaths as of Saturday morning local time. The KBO's plan shares many similarities with Taiwan's professional baseball league, which began play last month and broadcasts its games in English to the rest of the world. The island has a population of about 24 million people, but it had detected only440 coronavirus cases and recorded just six deaths as of Saturday morning local time.  That's thanks in large part to its rapid response, world-class healthcare system, early travel ban and the decision to ramp up domestic face mask production -- several lessons learned in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS pandemic. Having the virus under control allowed Taiwan to bring back professional baseball last month, though like the KBO, Taiwanese games are played with no human spectators.  Similarly, Australia is inching closer to bringing its multibillion-dollar sports industry back  Compared to most countries, Australia has a low rate of infection. As of Friday, fewer than 100 people had died. Authorities there moved quickly to ban international travelers from high-risk areas, close businesses and establish lockdowns, all the while making testing widely available.  Can KBO catch on?  It's not clear when the United States will be able to bring the rate of new infections down to the same level as Australia, South Korea or Taiwan. Though some states are gradually reopening, the virus is still killing hundreds of people each day.  An influential model often cited by the White House doubled its projections for the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the United States to more than 134,000 by August, largely because of relaxed social distancing measures.  If the situation fails to improve, it could further delay the return of live sports -- and push more viewers to options like the KBO.  ESPN's decision to air Korean baseball and dedicate editorial resources to covering it is very much an attempt to win back viewers who have stopped watching the network while American sports leagues are on hiatus.  ESPN's business model is hugely dependent on covering these leagues. Without live sports to broadcast, report on or discuss during talk shows, the network and its website have had to get creative, including re-airing old material and moving up the release of its critically acclaimed documentary series "The Last Dance."  But it's a gamble. ESPN is betting the experience of watching baseball in real time -- or slightly delayed -- will prove enough of a draw to fans of the game, even if they don't have a team or stars to root for.  It's likely too early to say if the bet will pay off, but ESPN's decision to air the KBO taps into the same value proposition the network was founded on 40 years ago: that live sports are dramatic and entertaining enough to attract a loyal audience and, sometimes, offer necessary respite from the harsh realities of the world.  And so far, Ravech said the response has been largely positive.  "It's been funny. People are on social media saying help me pick a team, who should I invest in," he said. "Given the uncertainty of Major League Baseball in this country, I do think over a period of time there will be a large number of people who say, how about those NC Dinos? They are playing great. Can you believe what just happened in the Samsung game?"

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  Instead, the novel coronavirus arrived at his doorstep  One of Trump's personal aides , Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary and Ivanka Trump's (remote) personal assistant have all tested positive for the virus in the past few days.  The virus' arrival at the White House is a stark reminder that the pandemic, which has killed more than 77,000 Americans , is far from over.  Despite the rising death toll, the President keeps pushing for a swift restart of the US economy, downplaying the need for more testing and focusing instead on shifting the blame to China.  "Will some people be affected badly? Yes," Trump said on Tuesday. "But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon."  The rest of the world is watching, with fear. Global leaders have warned that the Trump administration risks alienating allies by politicizing the pandemic. Beijing is pushing back with increasingly fierce rhetoric, as the rift between the world's two largest economies deepens, Nectar Gan writes.  The US, meanwhile, continues to scale back its role on the world stage, refusing to take a seat at virtual international meetings to coordinate work on vaccines. Experts, diplomats and analysts tell CNN that Trump's actions are undermining efforts to battle the pandemic and leaving the international community without a global leader.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: Should I delay my child's vaccinations until after the pandemic?  A: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday that The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday that childhood vaccinations have plunged since the Covid-19 pandemic began spreading through the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed alarm about the report and said: "Immunizing infants, children and adolescents is important, and should not be delayed."  The body recommends that children get 14 different vaccinations protecting against 19 pathogens. Timing is important for many of the vaccines to create the strongest immunity. Unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children will be at risk of other infectious diseases besides coronavirus as social distancing requirements are relaxed, the CDC warned.  Send your questions here .

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Triple drug therapy offers new hope  A combination of three antiviral drugs, plus an immune system booster, seems to help patients recover more quickly from coronavirus infections, doctors in Hong Kong announced yesterday  They say the approach needs more testing but could offer another possible treatment.  Americans split about reopening concerned about restrictions lifting too quickly  The US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs in April , the worst monthly plunge since records began more than 80 years ago.  The pressure to reopen the economy is mounting. Protesters have been taking to the streets for days, demanding individual states allow businesses to reopen. But as nearly all of them started lifting restrictions this week, the issue remains polarizing. Two-thirds of Americans say they are concerned about their states rushing to reopen, while nearly a third state restrictions are not being lifted quickly enough, according to a Pew Research Center survey.  Even protocols to wear masks to stop the spread of the virus have become a flashpoint, allegedly leading to one killing in Michigan and accusations of government overreach.  Seoul races to contain new outbreak  All bars in Seoul, South Korea have been shuttered after a spike in coronavirus cases linked to nightclubs.  A 29-year-old man tested positive for the virus on Thursday after visiting several clubs in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district. Since then, 40 others believed to be connected to the case have tested positive.  Officials have implemented measures to control the spread of the virus. At nightclubs, for instance, people must provide their full name and phone number before entry. According to authorities, 1,946 names were listed on the registry books of the three clubs the 29-year-old visited. Only 647 of those people have been identified.  The first at-home Covid-19 saliva test gets a green light  The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency-use authorization for the first at-home Covid-19 test that uses saliva samples, the agency said yesterday.  People can collect their saliva at home and send samples to a lab for results. The test remains prescription only.  Testing for Covid-19 so far has usually involved nose or throat swab samples. Experts, meanwhile, continue to insist that widespread testing is crucial for a safe reopening.

2020-05-10	Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, will self-quarantine after a staff member in his office tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement from Alexander’s chief of staff, David Cleary.  “Senator Alexander has no symptoms and tested negative for Covid-19 on Thursday afternoon, May 7. After discussing this with the Senate’s attending physician, Senator Alexander, out of an abundance of caution, has decided not to return to Washington, D.C., and will self-quarantine in Tennessee for 14 days. Almost all of the senator’s Washington, D.C., staff are working from home, and there is no need for any other staff member to self-quarantine,” Cleary said in the statement.  “The senator will be working remotely and will chair the Senate Health Committee hearing on Tuesday morning by video conference where the witnesses will be Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Robert Redfield, Dr. Brett Giroir and Dr. Stephen Hahn," Cleary said.  Cleary said the staffer is “recovering at home and is doing well.”
2020-05-10	A version of this story appeared in the May 10 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) The world is starting to emerge from the great lockdown. But rather than a Big Bang reopening, expect a two-steps-forward, one-step-back approach.  Countries that are ahead of the global curve offer a glimpse of what's to come. South Korea , which has done relatively well fighting the outbreak, announced new restrictions yesterday after a cluster of recent cases in Seoul sparked fears of a potential second wave of infections.  "It's not over until it's over," the country's president, Moon Jae-in, said today.  Spain, France, Italy, Australia, Japan and South Africa are among the countries expected to ease some of their harshest restrictions in the coming days.  Their approach isn't uniform but has one theme in common: caution. That might cause some disappointment as people itch to return to normality after weeks in lockdown.  Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil details of the government's reopening strategy today, but his ministers are trying to downplay expectations. The government's medical advisers continue to stress the need for social distancing and warn about the deadly consequences of letting the guard down too early.  Several leaks to the British media in recent days have created confusion about the restrictions still in place. In London, police say they are losing the battle against people ignoring rules.  In parts of the US, meanwhile, political and economic pressures -- not science -- appear to be shaping strategy, which former President Barack Obama recently called "an absolute chaotic disaster."  The tension between the two goals -- to keep people healthy and open the economy -- is increasingly visible. A vast majority of US states have eased restrictions, even as the country reported more than 25,600 new cases yesterday and three of its top health officials announced they would enter quarantine after being exposed to the virus.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: If I don't have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces?  A: Yes, just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don't use water alone — that won't really help. The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus' guts to spill out, rendering it dead. In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you're trying to clean.  "You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish," said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. "You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus."  By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams added, "it physically inactivates the virus so it can't bind to and enter human cells anymore."  Send your questions here .

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Worrying inflammatory syndrome  Doctors are raising alarm over a growing number of children falling ill with a new inflammatory illness that may be linked to Covid-19.  Health officials describe it as "pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome." Some children display persistent fever, toxic shock syndrome and features similar to Kawasaki disease , which causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. Symptoms include a high temperature lasting over five days, rashes, swollen neck glands and swelling of the hands and feet.  New York state officials said yesterday the condition has killed a teenager and two children under 8 years old . Similar cases have been identified in the UK, Italy and Spain.  4 million global cases  The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases around the world surpassed 4 million yesterday . More than quarter of them, 1.3 million , have been registered in the US.  Russia and Brazil have emerged as the latest hotspots, both seeing large jumps in the number of new infections in recent days.  In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat coronavirus presents.

Sam Kiley and Mostafa Salem report from the Persian Gulf, where overcrowded labor camps and densely populated neighborhoods have emerged as virus hot spots.  How masks define us  Face masks have emerged as a coronavirus fault line . The decision to wear or avoid them signals where people stand on public health guidelines.  Countries like the Czech Republic, Israel and Kenya require people to cover their noses and mouths when going out. Elsewhere, face covering remains optional or, as in Germany, restricted to specific places such as grocery stores and public transportation. In other parts of the world, they are turning into fashion statements  Global health experts agree masks can help limit the spread of the virus. But the prospect of a new society in which the public conceals their faces from one another has wide-ranging implications for crime and security, as well as social interaction, Luke McGee reports  ON OUR RADAR  A cluster of coronavirus cases in California has been traced to a coughing patient at a birthday party in Pasadena after the city issued a stay-at-home order in March.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN) The gaslighting show returned to the White House on Monday, with President Donald Trump and his retinue of sidekicks lying, misleading, and marketing the version of reality Trump wants Americans to believe. Ignore your own eyes, your upended lives, and the refrigerated trucks holding the dead bodies of coronavirus victims, he seemed to be saying, America is powering ahead now that their fearless leader has all but vanquished the invisible enemy.  "We have met the moment and we have prevailed," Trump proclaimed. It was quite a tale. He would go on to clarify the statement when presented with some facts, but the clarification would prove just as absurd.  The stark fact is that Americans are still dying in terrible numbers -- as many as 2,000 dying and 20,000 more diagnosed every single day -- with some projections that it could rise to as many as 200,000 new cases and 3,000 deaths each day by June 1. But Trump is pivoting sharply to the November election. It's all about winning reelection now, and that requires trying to convince Americans that the task is, to a large extent, complete.  While Trump claims that he has done a fantastic job and is moving to "transition to greatness" -- his new favorite slogan -- his accomplices in right-wing media have launched a campaign to discredit the statistics and boost conspiracy theories claiming the large death counts are a plot against the President.  Experience suggests that Trump will start openly tweeting his support for those claims -- Axios reports that he has already been complaining to his advisers -- as the November election starts getting closer and the numbers start to reflect epidemiologists' warnings that he is reopening the economy in an irresponsible manner that will lead to many more deaths than we would otherwise have.  Already one of the main forecasting sources used by the White House coronavirus task force has nearly doubled its estimate of deaths to more than 130,000 by August. That's tens of thousands of people who will lose their lives partly as the result of the premature, disorganized effort to goose the economy. Trump, probably rightly, believes a Great Depression-level unemployment rate could cost him the election.  So, he's pushing for a reopening now, with insufficient testing and without the CDC's guidelines on how to do it safely.  He wants to speak of the pandemic in the past tense, but reality gets in the way. When asked to explain his grotesque "we have prevailed" statement in the face of more than 80,000 coronavirus deaths, Trump claimed he was referring to testing, arguing against all evidence that he is doing a fantastic job on that front.  That is not true either, but that's only another obstacle to outshout.  The lies appeared even before the Monday briefing started. Banners deployed behind the lectern declared falsely "America leads the world in testing." That was the motto of the day, with Trump repeatedly making the claim, as if saying it often made it true.  The US may have conducted more tests than any country, but based on population it ranks nowhere near the top, according to the Worldometers tally at the time Trump was speaking. Indeed, it is below dozens of countries; worse than countries like Russia, Canada, Spain, Italy, Slovenia and Belarus.  Trump, with input from Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Brett Giroir and others, tried every manipulation of the numbers to deceive the American public into thinking the testing is a triumph. Trump and Giroir absurdly compared US testing levels to South Korea, a country that jumped into action early on, when Trump was still claiming the coronavirus was like the flu and America would soon have "zero" cases. South Korea doesn't need to test millions of people today because it only has a handful of new cases each day, compared with tens of thousands in the US.  Trump also claimed that the US and Germany have the lowest number of deaths per population. That is false. The US death rate of 247 per million of its population is among the higher tolls recorded. Germany's rate, according to Worldometers , is 91 per million.  As he has done for months, Trump claimed that anyone who wants to get tested today can do it. That is patently false. Then he made the stunning statement that only people with symptoms should be tested, even though we know that the most insidious form of virus transmission is coming from people who are infected but asymptomatic.  Both he and Giroir insisted that the US is conducting enough tests. But the US has not "prevailed" on that front, or on just about any front having to do with this catastrophically mismanaged challenge. Months ago, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. We're about one-third of the way there -- and it's mid-May. Experts say we need to conduct millions of tests per day in order to reopen the economy safely.  It is baffling why a country that can accomplish so many extraordinary feats has been incapable of producing enough swabs, reagents and testing kits. Trump has been dragging his feet in offering the states help with testing -- which he finally did on Monday -- but by now it is clear he will not wait until the testing is thorough and the number of cases makes it safe to reopen before urging Americans to return to work.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook  The White House has been trying to tap dance its way out of the damning fact that Trump is urging Americans to risk their lives despite insufficient testing, while requiring everyone in the White House to get checked regularly. The double standard only proves that Trump wants others to take risks he refuses to accept. It's all about the election. Even wearing a mask -- which he has now instructed people around him to do -- is something Trump refuses for himself, reportedly because he thinks it's not a good look for him. Besides, face masks protect others. Wearing one would not help him.  Everything Trump does now is about winning re-election. Nothing, not even stopping the pandemic, matters more to him.

The Cheyenne River Sioux and the nearby Oglala Sioux tribes have both issued strict stay-at-home orders and curfews for their communities even though there are no similar statewide restrictions.  4.

2020-05-11	That was South Korean President Moon Jae-in, speaking Sunday after a new cluster of coronavirus cases emerged in the country's capital Seoul, sparking fear of a second wave of infections in the East Asian country.  South Korea was among the first places to deal with a major coronavirus epidemic, and seemed to be on track to loosen restrictions , after weeks of social distancing measures and careful surveillance. But the new cluster seems to have put an end to that, for now, with Moon warning his people "we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention."  China too, is introducing renewed restrictions after two cities reported new cases of the virus. Shulan, in Jilin province in the country's far northeast, has been put under lockdown , following 11 newly confirmed cases. Jilin borders both Russia and North Korea, and concerns have previously been raised over imported cases from overseas causing a renewed outbreak.  People sit in a park in Seoul, South Korea on Sunday. The country announced its highest number of new coronavirus cases for more than a month on Monday.  More alarming are the new cluster of infections in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where cases of the novel coronavirus were first detected late last year. Wuhan was the first city in the world to enter into lockdown, only returning to relative normality late last month after 76-days  On Monday, city officials said five new cases had been confirmed in the city, none of which were imported from overseas. While that is a far cry from the figures at the beginning of the crisis, or those being reported daily across much of western Europe and the United States right now, the apparent ability of the virus to continue spreading undetected -- especially in a city as intensely surveilled and restricted as Wuhan -- will lead to concerns about the viability of reopening.  Mi Feng, spokesman for China's National Health Commission, on Sunday urged people to "stay alert and step up personal protection against the virus." He added that the new clusters were a reminder to avoid social gatherings and seek medical advice or testing should anyone exhibit virus symptoms.  Before the latest cases, the number of new infections in both China and South Korea had slowed to a trickle, with local transmission appearing to be halted. While questions can be raised over the accuracy of China's numbers, or the certainty anyone can have that all cases have been detected and contained in a country so large, South Korea's response has been hailed as one of the best globally , aided in part by the country's relative small size and easily-controlled borders.  Elsewhere in Europe, Germany had also been held up as an example of how to handle an outbreak, but its reproduction number has increased to above one for the past two days in a row, according to its center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This means that one infected person is on average infecting more than one other person.  It was seen as a regional success story thanks to a well-resourced health system and early mass testing. The country's reproduction number was estimated to have fallen to 0.65 last Thursday, and it had begun a slow reopening. Chancellor Angela Merkel told the public last week that they could "afford a bit of courage," while cautioning that "we have to watch that this thing does not slip out of our hands."  RKI said there was still a "degree of uncertainty" with the latest estimates but the increase in reproduction rate "makes it necessary to observe the development very closely over the coming days."  The German federal government and the states had agreed on a snap-back mechanism in case the virus returns. If any county exceeds 50 new coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants, lockdown measures will be reintroduced in that county. Over the weekend, several counties across the country exceeded that limit.  The latest cases may yet turn out to be a blip that will be contained, but that three countries which appeared to be on top of matters are again reporting domestic transmissions should be majorly concerning.  Will any lessons from these countries be learned in the West, where countries are several weeks behind in their outbreaks, but many governments are already champing at the bit to relax lockdowns, despite sky-high infection rates?  The new infections in China and South Korea also risk prompting a nihilistic response. If countries that appear to be on top of the disease cannot contain it, what can a nation with thousands of daily cases hope to do? But this is arguably the wrong takeaway -- these countries had the worst outbreaks in the world in February, but managed to get them under control. That they are seeing new cases is a lesson about the risks of relaxing too soon, not a reason to give up the fight entirely.  Nor is the message out of Asia all grim. Vietnam and Thailand are discussing the potential creation of a travel corridor , so confident are they that their domestic outbreaks are contained. New Zealand and Australia have already agreed to do the same -- though not for several months.  And Hong Kong, which successfully reined in a second wave of the virus when it seemed like the city might go the way of Singapore, has gone 21 days with no local infections, raising the possibility of being declared virus free later this month.  It's not over until it's over. But it will be over, eventually. What Asia's experience is showing is that this will require continued vigilance, and a lot of patience.

Particularly alarming is a spike of infections in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected late last year. The virus' reemergence and silent spread in the city — which only recently returned to relative normality after nearly three months of lockdown — will spark concerns about the risks of relaxing restrictions too soon.

But the plan, as well as the messaging around it, has left many confused.  As Johnson's advice shifts from "stay home" to "stay alert" — raising concerns about the possibility of a second wave of infections — Germany may offer a sign of what's ahead .

2020-05-11	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korea issued a warning Monday against leaking the personal information of coronavirus patients after local media speculation linked a recent outbreak to gay people in Seoul.  The country has won praise for its handling of the pandemic, but a fresh cluster of at least 86 cases has been linked to several nightclubs in the capital's Itaewon district.  Several South Korean media outlets reported last week that the venues were "gay clubs," though none of the venues describe themselves as such on their official websites or social media accounts.  Multiple reports also specified the age, district, type and location of work of the coronavirus patient believed to be at the center of the cluster. While the patient's age and district were posted by the city, details about the individual's work information were attributed in local media to unnamed officials.  At a news conference Monday, health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho warned that "leaking personal information of confirmed patients or spreading baseless rumors not only harms other but could be criminally punished," and said there was a trend of "criticism and hate against a certain group to which the infection occurred."

2020-05-11	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to the media during a daily briefing during the coronavirus pandemic outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Ontario, on Friday May 8. Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/AP  Hundreds of thousands of students in kindergarten to grade 6 were invited back to school Monday as Quebec became one of the first jurisdictions in North America to reopen some schools.  Attendance was voluntary and many parents kept their kids home, but others made their way into "Covid classrooms" with strict walking and spacing requirements, individual desks and supplies and no gym class or recess.  In Montreal, however, schools and most businesses remained closed for at least another two weeks as the epidemic in that city continues to peak. The city remains a hotspot for Covid-19 and is an outlier in terms of transmission, as most other parts of Canada have moved through the peak of infection and growth rates for new cases continue to decrease.  “We are all worried about the situation in Montreal,” said Quebec Premier Francois Legault during a press conference Monday promising that schools in the city would not be reopened until safer conditions could be achieved.  In other provinces across Canada, including Ontario, most schools remain closed.  Ontario also extended its state of emergency until early June despite a significantly lower growth rate of cases and widespread testing.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cautioned provincial leaders that any reopening should be slow and said all leaders were under pressure to ‘get this right’.
2020-05-11	Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox, sits empty on May 8, in Chicago, Illinois. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images  Multiple outlets, including the New York Times and ESPN, are reporting that Major League Baseball owners have agreed on a proposal to begin the 2020 season in early July with games being hosted in spectator-free home stadiums.  Reports of the proposal follow a Monday meeting between MLB executives and team leadership. The New York Times cited unnamed baseball officials while ESPN cited sources familiar with the situation.  According to the reports, the owners and league management have agreed upon an 82-game regular season, down from the traditional 162 games. Other details being reported are a second spring training starting next month, teams hosting games in their home stadiums as long as state legislation and health officials allow, use of the designated hitter in both the American and National Leagues, and expanded rosters which could utilize up to 50 players.  All of these proposed ideas would need to be agreed upon by the Major League Baseball Players Association in order to proceed with this unprecedented season. That could prove to be difficult as lines are already being drawn regarding key financial terms previously outlined in a March agreement on how much players would be paid in a shortened season.  Under the terms of the March agreement, MLB players received a $170 million salary advance. In exchange for that advance, the MLBPA agreed not to challenge the loss of the players’ 2020 salaries if the season were to be canceled and to accept prorated salaries if a partial season is played.  An excerpt of that March agreement, provided to CNN by a source with knowledge of MLB operations, indicates that if MLB games cannot be staged in teams' home stadiums in front of spectators, the MLB and MLBPA agree to hold good faith discussions about the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at neutral sites. MLB's position is that those discussions could include asking players to take further salary reductions.  The MLBPA is balking at the idea of reopening the discussion of players' salaries.  "Players recently reached an agreement with Major League Baseball that outlines economic terms for resumption of play, which included significant salary adjustments and a number of other compromises. That negotiation is over. We’re now focused on discussing ways to get back on the field under conditions that prioritize the health and wellbeing of players and their families, coaches, umpires, team staff and fans," MLBPA Executive Director Tony Clark said in a statement.  The potential financial snag could create a public relations nightmare for the sport at the worst possible time. As unemployment hits depression era levels, and the world economy struggles to reopen, this is not the kind of game that the fans want to see being played.  A separate source with knowledge of the MLBPA's position tells CNN that MLB owners are in no need of a financial bailout from MLB players. The source echoes Clark's position that the salary issue was previously settled in the March agreement, which provided the owners with flexibility to adjust their revenue sharing this season.  Multiple outlets are reporting that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred will present the proposal to the MLBPA this week, potentially as early as Tuesday.  CNN has reached out to MLB multiple times without a reply.
2020-05-12	(CNN) Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah criticized the Trump administration's failure in testing enough Americans for coronavirus during the pandemic, telling a top official in a congressional hearing on Tuesday, "I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever."  Romney pointed to comments made on Monday by Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, in which he claimed that the per capita rate of testing is now superior in the United States than even South Korea, which has been held up as a model.  Romney then told Giroir that South Korea's number of tests are decreasing while they're increasing in the US because they were quicker to test their citizens from the outset of the outbreak.  "I understand that politicians are going to frame data in a way that's most positive politically," said Romney. "Of course, I don't expect that from admirals."  "Yesterday you celebrated that we had done more tests and more tests per capita even than South Korea," he added. "But you ignored the fact that they accomplished theirs at the beginning of the outbreak, while we treaded water during February and March."
2020-05-12	(CNN) The big Senate coronavirus hearing Tuesday could not have been a better metaphor for America's self-isolated, stuck at home and increasingly scruffy state, two months into lockdown.  At the same hour, encapsulating the bizarre reality in Washington in 2020, the Supreme Court held the most important constitutional hearing in years with Justices dialing in on the phone to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's bid to keep his financial records secret.  Like the court's proceeding, the business of the committee was deeply consequential as it investigated the administration's handling of a crisis that has killed more than 80,000 Americans and infected more than a million.  About the only normal thing was the politics. Democrats on the committee sought to turn the heat up on Trump, who went on a Twitter tear before his top health adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci turned on his webcam. Republicans generally sought to offer the White House some cover for its missteps.  Some lawmakers beamed into the hearing from their homes, showing off their decor in a rare spate of senatorial transparency.  Others were in a mostly empty Capitol Hill hearing room, bottles of hand sanitizer at their elbows, around a table covered in black cloth. When they were not speaking, most senators in the room wore masks giving the hearing an apocalyptic air.  The star witnesses, top public health officials, some of whom were under various forms of quarantine after visits to the mini Covid-19 hotspot at the White House also testified remotely.

Giroir predicted the United States will be able to produce, distribute and apply "at least 40 to 50 million tests per month" by September. Hide Caption 8 of 13 Photos: Fauci and other health experts testify remotely at Senate hearing Fauci was subdued but candid in his testimony. "My concern that if some areas — cities, states or what have you — jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up, without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks," he said. Fauci also said schools should not expect a vaccine or widely available treatment for Covid-19 by the time students return to campuses in the fall.

He's already got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, so maybe a grateful nation can gift him a bookshelf for his service when this is all over.  Fauci in his frank, no-nonsense tone, put himself at odds with Trump on several issues, notably warning the many states ignoring government opening guidelines that by going too fast "There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control." But Fauci has not been a Washington power player for decades for nothing, and he mostly managed to walk a political tightrope throughout the hearing.  Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander — who is also self-isolating — gaveled in from his cabin in Tennessee, with wooden beams and a stone fireplace boosting his outdoorsman credentials. Now and then, Alexander's dog Rufus, who snoozed his way through a "Meet the Press" interview at the weekend, could be heard barking. As grandpas do, Alexander sometimes got too close to his webcam.  Had everyone been packed into the same Senate hearing room, in front of journalists, staffers and a public gallery, Tuesday's confrontations would likely have been far more contentious.  The reality of social distancing and dodgy Internet connections seemed to draw the sting out of some exchanges in the crucial hearing. But there was a sharp confrontation between Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Fauci, in a moment of one-upmanship between physicians.  Paul warned Fauci he shouldn't be the "end-all" of decision making on when to open up the economy and said schools needed to come back in the fall.  Fauci remonstrated with Paul, saying that he only gave advice on public health issues, telling the senator, in a grizzled beard after his own bout with Covid-19, "I have never made myself out to the the end-all and the only voice of this."  Fauci's colleague Dr. Robert Redfield also testified from home, in front of a full bookcase holding what looked like family snaps. Now and again, possibly due to connection issues, he appeared to go out of focus — offering a metaphor for critics of the Trump's administration's performance during the pandemic.  Another top health official Food and Drugs Commissioner Stephen Hahn is under full quarantine. He seemed to have tinkered with his backdrop to preserve his privacy — though almost looked to be shimmering in a backlit ethereal glow.  Back on Capitol Hill, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine was loaded for bear, wearing a red bandana that recalled the cowboys of the Wild West. Kaine elbow bumped with his neighbor Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina — also sporting a pandemic beard.  US Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Richard Burr of North Carolina greet each other with an elbow bump.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the award for street cred, showing off a webcam backdrop of merchandise featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers and New Power Generation, Prince's backing band. Sanders wasn't the only former presidential candidate on show. His former liberal rival Elizabeth Warren webcammed in from home as well.  You can take the man out of Bain Capital but you can't keep Bain Capital out of the man: Mitt Romney seemed to be in a family room surrounded by pictures of his well-known sons -- but he was still all business in a crisp white shirt and blue tie.  Romney also crossed his old foe Trump again — after voting for a single article of impeachment earlier this year — asking a question that effectively absolved his 2012 election opponent President Barack Obama from any responsibility in failing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. He also punctured Trump's claim on Monday that the US was better at testing than South Korea.  The hearing coincided with oral arguments in Supreme Court cases over Trump's attempts to prevent the handover of his financial records to Democrats in the House and New York prosecutors.  Chief Justice John Roberts, it turns out, is a stickler for time -- cutting off lawyers on both sides of the cases being argued when the time allocated to each of his colleagues on the virtual bench had elapsed.  The coincidence of hearing so critical to the scope of presidential power and a Senate panel on the worst domestic crisis since World War II would normally have meant a blockbuster Washington day.  But the remote nature of the two events didn't quite seem to add up to their combined significance and in the end served mostly to emphasize the dislocation in America at this strange time.  South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott put it best back in the hearing room: "Unquestionably we find ourselves in a situation that we wish we were not."
2020-05-12	New York (CNN Business) As the United States begins to reopen its economy, debates rage world-wide about how to balance economic hardship with a public health hazard.  With no easy answers to the dilemma, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for Allianz, says the focus needs to be on learning from the "massive experiment."  "The reality is that we are reopening," El-Erian said Tuesday in an interview on Quest Means Business."We need to judge not only the risk we took with respect to infection, but how people will behave, how businesses will behave."  "I don't know what the right answer is, but...we've got to learn and collect data and adapt quickly," he said.  Don't expect a smooth reopening, either, El-Erian warned.  Read More
2020-05-12	AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN TESTING  "We've prevailed on testing," Trump said Monday, standing between the signs.  While the US may have performed the most number of coronavirus tests, it's nowhere near the world's leader in testing per capita, multiple studies show.  And health experts say the US isn't close to the rate of testing needed to safely reopen the economy.  How many tests have been done?  By May 12, the US had conducted about 9.6 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project  As of May 11, the US has performed an average of 28.24 tests per 1,000 people, according to researchers from Oxford University  It's important to note some individuals have received multiple tests. For example, Vice President Mike Pence cited his frequent testing as a reason why he chose not to wear a face mask.  Public health experts say we don't need to test every American right now. But they say the US still isn't conducting enough tests to stop the spread of the virus enough to safely reopen the economy.  "This is due to a growing consensus among experts that the US is faring worse in this outbreak than previously thought," the institute said. "Social distancing measures have been able to stall the sharp increase of infection and death rates -- but unlike in many other nations, new cases are only very slowly decreasing."  On Monday, Trump said the US is conducting about 300,000 tests per day.  How does the US stack up against other countries?  There's no single definitive ranking system because there are variations in how some countries report their testing.  "The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country -- one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once)," the Oxford researchers said on their website OurWorldInData.org  So CNN looked at different rankings, and each study showed that many other countries have higher per capita testing rates.  As of April 26, the US ranked 22nd in the number of tests performed per capita, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump's April claim about the US testing more than "every country combined" was "way off."  "The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done -- but not more than all other countries combined," FactCheck.org said.  "Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy -- the next three countries that have done the most testing -- would produce a higher figure. ... So, Trump's claim is not even close to being accurate."  Republican senators say testing is still insufficient  Lawmakers have urged the administration to keep ramping up testing to help states allow businesses and schools to open.  "All roads back to work and back to school run through testing. And that what our country has done so far on testing is impressive, but not nearly enough," Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Tuesday.  Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, questioned the administration's touting of conducting more tests than South Korea, including more tests per capita than South Korea  And while South Korea has kept its Covid-19 deaths under 300, Romney noted, the US death toll is more than 82,000 and climbing  "I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever," Romney said. "The fact is (South Korea's) test numbers are going down, down, down now because they don't have the kind of outbreak now. Ours are going up, up, up, because they have to."
2020-05-12	A version of this story appeared in the May 12 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) All but two US states will be partially reopened by the end of the week, even as new coronavirus cases continue to climb and testing and tracing efforts fall short of what is needed to rein in the pandemic.  On a tragic day when US deaths passed 80,000, President Donald Trump boasted about his administration's handling of the crisis, saying "we have met the moment and we have prevailed." But contrary to his claims in the Rose Garden yesterday, not everyone who wants to get tested can do so. The eligibility criteria varies dramatically from state to state, and some jurisdictions are still experiencing shortages of key materials.  Meanwhile, Trump's own experts and the World Health Organization are cautioning against returning to normal life too soon. Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation's top infectious diseases expert, plans to warn a Senate committee during a hearing today that if the US opens up prematurely, Americans will face "needless suffering and death," according to an email he sent to The New York Times.  Fauci is currently in "modified quarantine" after two administration staffers tested positive for the virus. Trump is concerned that the White House outbreak will undercut his message that the crisis is waning and states should begin reopening, according to a person who spoke with him.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED  Q: Will antibody tests allow us to go back to work?  A: As governments scramble to restart the economy, one way of getting people back to work is gaining support: As governments scramble to restart the economy, one way of getting people back to work is gaining support: antibody tests . The hope is that those who have been infected may have developed enough antibodies to make them immune — rendering their return to the office safe — though the science around this is far from settled . But experts warn that going down this route could create new problems, including discrimination in workplaces, or people deliberately trying to get infected so they can return to their jobs sooner, "playing Russian roulette" with their lives, as one doctor put it.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY  Mask memo to West Wing staff  While officials are now required to wear face coverings in the West Wing , Trump, who has said he cannot envision wearing a mask in public, may be less likely to do so. The first lady , on the other hand, has been vigilant in practicing social distancing and wearing a mask, and has asked staff in the East Wing to do the same.  Elsewhere, masks have become a key part of reopening strategies. They're now compulsory on the Paris metro system , after France began to lift its lockdown yesterday. Across the Channel, the UK has recommended that masks be worn on public transport, as some restrictions lift — but they're still not mandatory.  What the White House can learn from Downing Street  If Trump needs reminding of how easily the coronavirus can spread in the workplace, he need only pick up the phone and call his friend Boris Johnson, Luke McGee writes . The UK Prime Minister knows first-hand the agony of Covid-19, having survived a serious bout of the virus that left his government rudderless at the worst possible time.  Experts say the UK offers a simple lesson for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence: If you can't stay healthy, you can't lead your country through this crisis.  Cases climb in recently reopened countries  "Over the weekend we saw signs of the challenges that may lie ahead," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, referring to the surge of cases in the three countries. Tedros added that the uptick is a sign that, without a vaccine, strict social distancing measures must be kept in place.  Viral photo of crowded United Airlines flight.

Coronavirus  Countries that have eased social distancing restrictions are seeing a spike in coronavirus cases. In Wuhan, where the virus was first discovered, millions of residents will be tested after case numbers rose despite months of lockdown measures; tests will happen within a 10-day period but we don't know when they will begin. Germany and South Korea are also seeing spikes . These patterns aren't exactly sparking concerns among many Americans. In Pennsylvania, leaders of some businesses and Republican-led counties have said they'll defy Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's restrictive orders. It's the latest evidence that US residents are split over how to conduct their daily lives now that almost all states are in the process of reopening.

Health  The House is planning to introduce a bipartisan bill today to create a National Public Health Corps that would fulfill some of the country's most dire medical and economic needs. The idea is to create a national testing strategy and hire Americans who are searching for jobs to roll it out. The group would employ hundreds of thousands to help conduct testing, contact tracing of those infected or potentially infected with the coronavirus and eventually vaccinations. On the virus treatment front, doctors are agonizing over the possibility they may have to ration the use of remdesivir , that experimental drug that could be used to treat Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, another study has found hydroxychloroquine, the drug touted by some politicians as a potential treatment, is not effective against the disease  JUST WATCHED CNN follows contact tracers as they try to contain Covid-19 Replay More Videos ...

Economy  House Democrats are working on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package despite pushback from the Trump administration and Republican leaders who don't want to add to the trillions of dollars in relief funds already in play. The bill is expected to mirror -- and potentially go beyond -- the $2 trillion measure from late March . Among its possible provisions: direct assistance to Americans, support for unemployment insurance, new funding for mail-in voting, bailouts for cash-strapped states and cities, more money for distressed businesses, student loan assistance measures and aid for rent and mortgage payments. It's not, however, expected to include a sweeping paycheck measure championed by progressives that would cover tens of thousands of dollars in lost wages for workers.

Supreme Court  The Supreme Court is due to hear a trio of cases today that could carry serious implications for how we interpret the government's separation of powers. The disputes stem from stalled efforts by the House and state prosecutors to obtain financial records from President Trump. They wanted to use the records to investigate allegations of misconduct before Trump became president, but Trump intervened to try to block the subpoenas. He lost in lower courts, and thus, here we are. The outcome of these cases could draw the line on how much immunity a sitting president has against scrutiny from government.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador signed a decree that would install the National Guard on Mexican streets for the next five years, a time frame designed to help the force improve its capabilities. Lopez Obrador created the National Guard shortly after he took office in 2018 to combat Mexico's historic levels of violence, pulling members from units of the armed forces. Its goal is to reduce violence by primarily focusing on organized criminal groups. Mexico recorded 2,585 murders in March, marking the country's deadliest month since December 2018.

2020-05-12	People walk down a street in downtown Reykjavik, Iceland, on April 30. Egill Bjarnason/AP  Iceland expects to start lifting restrictions on international arrivals to the country "no later than June 15," the government said in a statement on Tuesday.  Travelers will likely have to choose between being tested for Covid-19 or a two-week quarantine upon arrival. All arrivals will also be required to use the official tracing app during their stay.  "Iceland's strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far. We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us," the Minister of Tourism, Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, said in a statement.  The government also announced that some professionals arriving in Iceland from May 15, including essential workers, "scientists, filmmakers, and athletes will be eligible for a modified quarantine." This means companies can request an exemption from quarantine if they can guarantee safety procedures in their work environment.  "These measures do not preclude the option of bilaterally opening borders between coronavirus-free countries," the government added.  Since January, Iceland residents arriving from "high-risk" areas have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The rule was extended to all travelers on April 24, as Iceland kept its Schengen borders open throughout the pandemic.  So far, Iceland has only seen three confirmed infections of Covid-19 in May, according to the statement.
2020-05-12	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) A cluster of coronavirus cases connected to clubs frequented by South Korea's gay community has sparked an outpouring of hate speech towards the country's already-embattled LGBTQ population.  The cluster has caused alarm in South Korea, which was among the first countries outside of China to deal with a large-scale coronavirus outbreak . In recent weeks, however, authorities had begun loosening restrictions as case numbers fell.  The suggestion that the outbreak is linked to the city's gay scene has sparked a huge backlash against the LGBTQ community, including the 29-year-old man believed to be at the center of the cluster.  Local media has emphasized his sexual orientation and reported that the clubs he visited are gay venues, although the venues do not openly describe themselves as such on their official websites or social media accounts.  That reaction could make contact tracing harder, with people afraid to be associated with the LGBTQ community and having their sexuality outed.  Although all three venues linked to the cluster asked for customers' full names and phone numbers on arrival, the city has been unable to contact almost 2,000 club-goers -- meaning they either avoided the calls or gave a false number, Seoul's mayor Park Won-soon said Monday.  The city has had to employ other measures to track them. Using phone signal tower records, the city found that 10,905 people were in the vicinity of the clubs in the nightlife suburb of Itaewon between April 24 and May 6. Authorities have texted them all, saying they should get tested. Officials have also used credit cards to track almost 500 people, who have been asked to get tested and self-quarantine.  The number of people who had been tested had nearly doubled between Sunday and Monday, after authorities began offering anonymous tests, Park said Tuesday.  "The growing number of condemnation and hate speech definitely does not help and only has adverse effects," he said.  The outbreak also showed the need to always be on alert, Park said.  "If the disease penetrates Seoul, the Korean peninsula is penetrated," he said in an interview with CNN. "We are seriously afraid, trying to find out the visitors as soon as possible."  A couple wearing face masks walk past a night club, now closed following a visit by a confirmed Covid-19 coronavirus patient, in the popular nightlife district of Itaewon in Seoul on May 10, 2020.  How the case unfolded  On the night of May 1 and the early hours of May 2, a 29-year-old man visited several clubs in Itaewon, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). On May 7, the man tested positive for Covid-19.  At the time when the man went to the clubs, South Korea was still under strict social distancing rules, and citizens were encouraged to stay home and limit unnecessary contact with others. Those social distancing rules were lifted on May 6.  KCDC deputy director Kwon Joon-wook said Tuesday that there are now two people identified as first showing symptoms on May 2 and said the Itaewon cluster may have "various epicenters or sources."  Under non-inforceable pandemic reporting guidelines that were drafted by Korea's journalist associations, media are told to avoid violating patients' privacy and using sensational language in reporting.  But as the news broke, several South Korean media organizations reported that the bars the 29-year-old had visited were gay bars. That detail, coupled with the already-publicly available information about the man's age, district of residence, and movements, meant that the media had effectively outed him, potentially putting his employment at risk.  Kwon said it was important to protect the personal information of those infected, and South Korean authorities have warned that leaking personal information of Covid-19 patients could also be a criminal offense.  On Monday, a Ministry of Health official, Yoon Tae-ho, said that there had been a trend of "criticism and hate against a certain group to which the infection occurred," without explicitly naming the LGBTQ community.  "Leaking personal information of confirmed patients or spreading baseless rumors not only harms other but could be criminally punished," Yoon added.  In a statement, LGBT rights advocacy group, Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, said the media's decision to reveal personal details of the 29-year-old patient had incited hatred and was a serious human rights violation.  "The attitude of media, who are obsessed with revealing the sexual orientation of the confirmed case and digging up information that has nothing to do with the disease, is adding a stigma of the disease to the hatred of minorities that has been prevalent in Korean society," the statement said.  JUST WATCHED Four possible reasons people are retesting Covid-19 positive Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Four possible reasons people are retesting Covid-19 positive 02:28  A wider issue of discrimination  Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea also warned that discriminatory media reports would drive the coronavirus underground. "It makes self-isolation and testing difficult," the statement said.  That is also a concern of one 25-year-old in Seoul, who identifies as gay and who asked to be anonymous out of fear of discrimination,who says he was at two of the Itaewon clubs connected with the outbreak in early May.  "Gays feel cornered. Either out yourself and potentially ruin your life, or stay in the closet but risk spreading corona," he said. "Gays are also feeling like there's this double standards, where they are being asked to be upstanding citizens and 'get tested for your country,' meanwhile the country treats them like dirt."  South Korea has no comprehensive anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ South Koreans, and compared to nearby democracies such as Japan and Taiwan, the country is less accepting of same-sex couples.  LGBTQ soldiers serving in South Korea's military face abuse and discrimination, according to an Amnesty International report . Homosexual sex is illegal in the military whether it happens on or off base, and regardless of whether one party is not an enlisted soldier -- something that is not the case for heterosexual sex.  The 25-year-old says the backlash to the latest cluster is only going to inflame that situation, with many in LGBTQ community afraid they might lose their jobs. Some have been threatened on the gay dating app Grindr, he added.  "Korea is such a homophobic place, these clubs are really a haven for these people," he says. "I would hate to see them shut down permanently because of this virus or homophobia."  The night out he had in early May was a normal evening, he says.  "Boys out dancing to K-pop, grabbing drinks, talking to old friends, really innocent stuff," he said. "It's frustrating that the media is treating them all like sex clubs."  How clubs should handle coronavirus  The outbreak has also highlighted the difficulty in containing outbreaks in clubs around the world -- regardless of the clubgoers' orientation.  Bars are often frequented by young people -- and experts believe that while this demographic is less likely to die from the virus, they may have contributed to its spread.

MUST WATCH How do you hold an election during a global pandemic? 02:21  That's an issue that other countries are also thinking about. When New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Monday that she was easing lockdown restrictions, she opted to delay opening the country's clubs and bars, pointing to South Korea's experience.  Over the weekend, Hong Kong's famous nightlife district Lan Kwai Fong reopened, although clubs and karaoke bars remain closed.  Allan Zeman, the chairman of Lan Kwai Fong, said that bars only filled about 50% of capacity, tables were spread out, patron's temperatures were taken and people needed to wear masks before they came inside. Patrons were also encouraged to leave their name and contact details. Over the weekend, many partygoers gathered on the street outside bars, which was "pretty upsetting," he said.  He expects that bars and clubs will be taking additional precautions -- such as temperature checks -- for some time, but doesn't expect people to stop going out altogether.  "It's human nature -- people want to go out, they want to enjoy themselves," he said. "You need to otherwise you'll explode."  Back in Seoul, the authorities are also trying to strike that balancing act. Park said citizens demand economic activities -- but at the same time, they needed to deal with coronavirus.  "We are living at the age of coronavirus and human beings (living in) coexistence."
2020-05-12	Hong Kong (CNN) Millions of people in Wuhan will be tested for the novel coronavirus within the coming days, after a new cluster of cases emerged despite a strict 76-day lockdown that was intended to eliminate the virus from the central Chinese city.  Over the weekend, six new cases were reported in the city, the first in 35 consecutive days. None of the new cases were imported from overseas, sparking concern that the infection could still be spreading in the city where the virus is thought to have first emerged.  In response to the outbreak, authorities in Wuhan will conduct city-wide nucleic acid testing over a period of 10 days, according to an emergency notice issued by local authorities and circulated by state run media outlet The Paper.  Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code , and can be more effective at detecting the infection, particularly in the early stages, than tests which examine a body's immune response, though the latter are easier to conduct.  The ambitious screening drive, described in the report as a "ten-day battle," could see up to 11 million people tested -- more than the entire population of Greece.  Read More
2020-05-12	POOL  Neither President Trump nor his predecessor President Obama are responsible for the lack of a coronavirus vaccine, Dr. Anthony Fauci said.  He was responding to GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's question about President Trump's recent suggestion that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine.  "The President said the other day that President Obama is responsible for lack of vaccine. Dr. Fauci, is President Obama — or by extension President Trump — did they do something that made the likelihood of creating the vaccine less likely?" Romney asked.  "Certainly President Obama nor President Trump are not responsible for not having a vaccine," Fauci said.  He added that the US has moved "rapidly" from discovering the virus to having trials for vaccines.  Romney then added that he was "surprised" by Trump's suggestion.  "That was my impression. I was surprised by the comment," he said.
2020-05-12	(CNN) Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, warned senators Tuesday that states and cities face serious consequences if they open up too quickly, urging states not to reopen until they know they have the capabilities to handle an inevitable uptick in cases once they relax stay-at-home orders.  In a high-profile hearing where witnesses and many lawmakers joined via video conference, Fauci also told a Senate committee on Tuesday it was a "bridge too far" for schools to expect a vaccine or widely available treatment for Covid-19 by the time students return to campuses in the fall, though he expressed optimism a vaccine would be developed in the next year or two.  Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was subdued but candid in his testimony about efforts to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and roll-back stay-at-home orders on Tuesday in the Senate's first hearing on the coronavirus outbreak since March. He told the Senate panel he did not have a "confrontational relationship" with President Donald Trump, but Fauci's testimony nevertheless contrasted Trump's increasingly vocal push in recent days for states to re-open businesses.  "My concern that if some areas -- cities, states or what have you -- jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up, without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks," Fauci said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  "There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control, which in fact, paradoxically, will set you back, not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery," Fauci later added.  Tuesday's hearing, titled "Covid-19: Safely getting back to work and school," was a strange reminder of the challenges coronavirus poses and the lengths Congress has gone to try to operate with any semblance of normalcy. All four witnesses and committee leaders appeared remotely. Three of the witnesses and the chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, weren't present because they're self-isolating or self-quarantining to some degree after contact with individuals who tested positive for coronavirus.  Dr. Anthony Fauci is seen in this screengrab at the start of his testimony Tuesday.  Alexander quarterbacked the hearing via video conference at his cabin in Maryville, Tennessee. His dog, Rufus, could be heard barking in the background while the chairman was speaking and slept on camera for much of the hearing. Inside the mostly empty hearing room, which was closed to the public, some of the senators in attendance were wearing masks, while others were not while sitting at their socially distanced seats below the normal hearing dais.  Fauci and other public health experts, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield testified Tuesday in what could be one of the only public hearings featuring members of the White House coronavirus task force.  The hearing occurred as states across the country have started taking actions to roll back the business closures and stay-at-home orders put in place two months ago to try to slow the coronavirus infection rate. The testimony and senators' questions often illustrated the divide within the country between Republicans and Democrats over how the administration has handled the crisis and the best path forward amid warnings that positive cases could surge again if restrictions rolled back too quickly.  Democrats pressed Fauci and the officials on the disconnect between the President's comments and the recommendations of public health experts.  "The fact of the matter is, President Trump has been more focused on fighting against the truth, than fighting this virus — and Americans have sadly paid the price," said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the committee.  Republicans warn against 'finger-pointing'  Alexander and other Republicans on the panel viewed Tuesday's hearing as a showcase for what the administration has been working on, hoping that the reputations of scientists like Fauci would lend credibility to the work that is occurring. In his opening statement, Alexander urged senators not to engage in "finger-pointing" when the entire world underestimated the virus.  "Before we spend too much time finger-pointing, I'd like to suggest that almost all of us, the United States and almost every country, so far as I can tell, underestimated this virus, underestimated how contagious it would be, underestimated how it could travel silently in people without symptoms to infect other people," Alexander said.  The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is in session for the coronvirus hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.  Fauci has become one of the Trump administration's leading -- and most credible -- voices during the pandemic on the White House's coronavirus task force, willing to break with Trump on issues like testing and rolling back stay-at-home orders.  But there's been a backlash to the public health experts like Fauci urging states to keep businesses closed until the number of cases declines further.  Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who tested positive for coronavirus in March, challenged Fauci and other public health experts Tuesday, arguing that the virus has been on a "relatively benign course" outside of high infection rates in New England. He warned that there would be an even greater damage to the country if schools did not re-open in the fall.  "As much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don't think you're the end-all," Paul said. "I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there's not going to be a surge and that we can safely open the economy. And the facts will bear this out."  Fauci responded that he "never made myself out to be the end-all." He said he was humble about the effects of Covid-19, given all that is still unknown about the virus, and warned the country should be "very careful, particularly with children."  "I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects," Fauci said.  The issues surrounding children and schools was a topic that was repeatedly raised during Tuesday's hearing, with questions still swirling about how schools deal with the virus in the fall.  Fauci acknowledged the problems with students missing school but said he didn't have a good solution to address the issue, suggesting school reopenings could vary by region.  "I don't have an easy answer to that. I just don't," Fauci told Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is a doctor. "We just have to see on a step-by-step basis as we get into the period of time with the fall about reopening the schools, exactly where we will be, and the dynamics of the outbreak."  Senators urge ramp-up in testing  Senators in both parties urged the administration to continue ramping up testing to help states allow businesses and schools to open.  Alexander has been pushing for the Trump administration to increase testing, even while Trump has claimed the US had "prevailed" and was "leading the world" on testing and falsely said any American who wants a test can get a test. Alexander walked the line between the competing claims in his opening statement, saying that the US efforts on testing were "impressive" but more needed to be done.  "All roads back to work and back to school run through testing. And that what our country has done so far on testing is impressive, but not nearly enough," Alexander said.  Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, was more blunt in assessing the administration's track record, questioning the administration's touting of conducting more tests than South Korea, noting the US lag in tests earlier this year and South Korea's Covid-19 death toll remaining under 300, compared to more than 80,000 in the US.  "I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever," Romney said. "The fact is their test numbers are going down, down, down now because they don't have the kind of outbreak now -- ours are going up, up, up because they have to."  In addition to Fauci and Redfield, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Adm. Brett Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services, testified at Tuesday's hearing.  Giroir told the committee that since March 12, the country has performed more than 9 million Covid-19 tests, while noting it would still take a few more months to ramp up production further. Giroir predicted the US will be able to produce, distribute and apply "at least 40 to 50 million tests per month" by September, if states need that many tests.  The public health experts were pressed on a number of additional topics at the wide-ranging hearing. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, pressed Redfield on reports that the White House shelved CDC's detailed re-opening recommendations. Redfield responded they would be released "soon."  In addition to testing, Redfield acknowledged the challenges the US faces with contact tracing and the surveillance system used to track and analyze data around Covid-19 cases, saying it was "archaic." Redfield said the system was "one of the many shortcomings that had been identified" as the pandemic hit.  "It's time to get that corrected," he said.  Redfield was also asked about deaths and cases of coronavirus in nursing homes, which he called "one of the great tragedies that we've all experienced together."  "Clearly, the long-term care facilities have been particularly hard hit by this pandemic," Redfield said. "All nursing homes now are required to report cases in either their individuals that are patients there or staff to the CDC. All nursing homes are required to notify members of that nursing home of the existence of Covid in that nursing home."  Fauci was asked whether the overall coronavirus death toll was accurate. "The number is likely higher," Fauci responded. "I don't know exactly what percent higher -- but almost certainly it's higher."  And he was quizzed on his views on whether a vaccine was possible within a year or two. "It's definitely not a longshot," Fauci said. "I would think it's more likely than not that we will."  White House could limit future hearings  The hearing could be one of Democrats' only chances to question Fauci and other senior officials after the White House has said they would make limited exceptions to a policy that officials on the White House's task force should be spending their time combating coronavirus, not testifying before Congress.  Asked last week why he wouldn't allow Fauci to testify before the House Appropriations Committee, Trump said: "Because the House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters."  Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Richard Burr of North Carolina greet each other with an elbow bump before the committee hearing on Tuesday.  At Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont asked Hahn a question that's looming but still theoretical: whether a coronavirus vaccine, when developed, would be distributed to people free of charge.  "I certainly hope so," Hahn responded. "FDA is very committed to making sure that all populations in the United States, including those most vulnerable, are included in the clinical trials."  When Sanders pressed Hahn on whether he could guarantee the vaccine was available to everyone, Hahn responded that "the payment of vaccines is not a responsibility to FDA." He said he would bring the question to the administration's task force, noting he shares Sanders' "concern that this needs to be made available to every American."  All four witnesses appeared Tuesday remotely, after the White House agreed to an exception to a policy about officials not testifying remotely. Hahn and Redfield are both self-isolating due to their contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus, and Fauci has said he will observe a "modified quarantine" after what he described as "low-risk" contact with Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary who tested positive last week.  Alexander is self-quarantining for 14 days after a staffer in his office tested positive for coronavirus.  This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

On Tuesday, a fire in St. Petersburg claimed the lives of five patients and forced the evacuation of 150 people. Three days earlier a similar incident killed one patient in Moscow. Both hospitals used Aventa-M ventilators, Roszdravnadzor said.  Aventa-M is a flagship ventilator produced by KRET, which is part of state-owned defense producer Rostec.  KRET has been designated by the Russian authorities as the main supplier of ventilators in the country. According to a government contract, KRET is supplying 6,711 ventilators in total this year to Russia’s regional hospitals. In April, the company said it would increase its production capacity from 10 ventilators to 100 ventilators a day.  Aventa-M ventilators were also part of a shipment of medical supplies sent by Russia to the US in early April.  A FEMA spokesperson told CNN the ventilators had never been deployed and the shipment was returned by New York and New Jersey.
2020-05-13	(CNN) Dr. Anthony Fauci and three other top Trump administration officials testified before Congress on Tuesday , describing the administration's response to the Covid-19 outbreak and what reopening the country might look like in the coming months.  Senators from both sides of the aisle sharply probed the administration's actions for testing and preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Fauci, who was the primary recipient of the committee's questions, defended the guidance he'd given President Donald Trump and the country.  These are some of the top moments from Tuesday's hearing:  Fauci has a warning for state and municipal governments about reopening  Fauci used much of his time before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to urge states not to reopen until they know they have the capabilities to handle an inevitable uptick in cases once they relax stay-at-home orders.  "My concern that if some areas -- cities, states or what have you -- jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up, without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks," Fauci said.  "There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control, which in fact, paradoxically, will set you back, not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery," Fauci later added.

Rand Paul tells Dr. Fauci he isn't the 'end all' 04:02  Fauci defends his role after Rand Paul challenges his assessment  In perhaps the most contentious part of the hearing, Fauci defended his guidance to the task force after Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, challenged him, saying he doesn't think Fauci is the "end-all," and "the one person that gets to make the decision" regarding reopening the US economy.  Fauci responded that he "never made (himself) out to be the end-all and only voice in this" and noted that "there are a number" of other officials who weigh on the administration's strategy.  "I'm a scientist, a physician and a public health official. I give advice, according to the best scientific evidence," he said. "I don't give advice about economic things."  Vaccine before school year starts in the fall a 'bridge too far,' Fauci predicts  Near the start of the hearing, Fauci also weighed in on plans for the schools and universities trying to plan how to safely bring students back to campuses, saying the notion of a vaccine or treatment at that point was a "bridge too far."  "The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate the reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far," he said.  Fauci says the death toll is likely higher  Fauci said he agreed with the assessment that some health experts have made that the US death toll for Covid-19 is "almost certainly" higher than is currently reported.  "Given the situation, particularly in New York City -- when they were really strapped with a very serious challenge to their health care system -- that there may have been people who died at home who did have some Covid who are not counted as Covid because they never really got to the hospital," Fauci said.  He said he's not sure "exactly what percent higher" the real death toll could be. "But almost certainly it's higher," he added. At the time of the hearing, the US death toll was just over 81,000  JUST WATCHED Romney rebukes Trump official for what he said at briefing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Romney rebukes Trump official for what he said at briefing 00:59  Romney rebukes administration's testing numbers  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah used his time during the hearing to call out the Trump administration's lack of Covid-19 testing, saying, "I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever."  Romney pointed to comments made on Monday by Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, in which he claimed that the US per capita rate of testing is now superior even to South Korea, which has been held up as a model. Giroir was among those testifying besides Fauci.  Romney then told Giroir that South Korea's number of tests is decreasing while they're increasing in the US because it was quicker to test its citizens from the outset of the outbreak.  "I understand that politicians are going to frame data in a way that's most positive politically," said Romney. "Of course, I don't expect that from admirals."  "Yesterday you celebrated that we had done more tests and more tests per capita even than South Korea," he added. "But you ignored the fact that they accomplished theirs at the beginning of the outbreak, while we treaded water during February and March."  Fauci says his relationship to Trump is not confrontational ...  Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia asked Fauci about his relationship to Trump, one that has been under scrutiny since the White House task force has regularly appeared with the President.  "There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the President," Fauci said. "As I've mentioned many times, I give advice and opinion based (on) evidence-based scientific information. He hears that. He respects it. He gets opinions from a variety of other people. But in no way, in my experience over the last several months, has there been any confrontational relationship between us."  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who were also testifying at the hearing, also said they did not have confrontational relationships with Trump.  ... and he's doing just fine  Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, started her five minutes of questions with a simple one for Fauci. "How are you doing and how are you holding up?" she asked him.  "This is, this is such an important problem," Fauci said. "It transcends all of us individually, and we have to be working as a team. And I enjoy very much working with your senators and the governors, because it's at the local level that we're going to make it work. So I am fine. I appreciate your concern."
